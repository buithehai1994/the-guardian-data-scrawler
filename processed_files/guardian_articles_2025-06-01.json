Training these also involves bending over and picking stuff up – usually a barbell, but sometimes a kettlebell or pair of dumbbells. “Here’s a few things deadlifts help with,” saysLaura Kummerle, a Georgia-based physiotherapist and personal trainer (PT). “Lifting your grocery bags off the ground on to the counter, lifting your laundry basket off the ground, lifting your kid/grandkid (especially out of their crib when you can’t squat), lifting a piece of furniture or a heavy rock for landscaping … They work the hip hinge, which is a fundamental movement pattern for strength training, but more importantly for daily life.”View image in fullscreen‘Start with a little hinge and push your bum back’ … Joseph coaches Daoust at Fantastic Creatures gym in Walthamstow, east London.Photograph: Alicia Canter/The Guardian“If I could only do one exercise in the gym ever again, deadlifts are the one I would do,” saysCali Joseph, a PT based in Walthamstow, east London. “They’re the pinnacle of weight training.” That’s because even though you’re lifting the weight no higher than your thighs, the way you hinge rather than squat means they work everything from your hamstrings, quads, glutes and back to your core, shoulders and arms.They also make a lot of people very happy, and not just because of some kind of lifter’s high.Mira Taylor, a personal trainer based in north Wales, began focusing on deadlifts five years ago and is now a British and European deadlift-only champion. “I think it’s pathological for me at this point,” she says. “Obviously the sense of progression and hitting or chasing personal bests is intoxicating, but it’s also the fact that you have to clear your mind completely when you’re lifting a heavy barbell. That’s very therapeutic.”Some people will tell you deadlifts are risky, especially if you’re getting on a bit, but then some people will tell you running is risky, or cycling, or picking up anything more substantial than a golf club. “Anything can be dangerous,” says Kummerle. “Drinking too much water can be dangerous; stepping off a kerb can be dangerous. Everything we do has risk, but the benefits outweigh the risks of deadlifts, for sure. I’m not saying everyone should be maxing out their deadlift, but loading the movement with what feels like a light to moderate weight can reduce the risk of injury in daily life. That way when you go and pick up your kid or help a friend move house, your body is used to that stimulus.”View image in fullscreen‘You have to clear your mind completely’ … Mira Taylor celebrates a record lift at the British Single Lift Championships, May 2024.Photograph: Shots Like SumoIt’s also useful for rehab. “Deadlifts are good for any injury to build back general strength once you’re able to do the hip hinge pattern safely,” says Kummerle. “They can be particularly helpful for knees, hips and backs, but I can also see them being useful for ankles, shoulders and even necks.”My own physio’s definitely a fan. I’m recovering from a knee injury, and she had me deadlifting less than two months after surgery for my torn meniscus.Even as a beginner, and one who’s careful to take things slowly, I’ve been deadlifting 50kg – more than half my own weight. More experienced lifters might aim to shift double or even treble their bodyweight. Taylor, who competes in the under-60kg category (based on what competitors weigh, not their barbells), lifted 170kg at last November’s World Powerlifting Congress World Championships.But the heavier you lift, the more form matters. “The problem with a deadlift is that you can brute-force it,” says Joseph, who has agreed to help me with mine. “If you’re strong, you can just get the bar off the ground and stand up – but that’s how you ended up getting injured.” She’s speaking from personal experience.So off to the bar we go – all 7ft and 20kg of it. Bars come in various lengths and weights, some more suitable for home workouts, but it’s this “Olympic” size that you’ll find in most gyms. When people talk about how much they lift, that includes the bar, so if you’re lifting 30kg, that means you’ve stuck a 5kg “plate” on either end of yours.It’s important that you set up correctly, Joseph says – the first step being to make sure you’re in the dead centre of the bar, hands evenly spaced and about shoulder width apart. There should be markings to help with this. This may sound basic, but it’s surprisingly easy to pick up a bar off-centre, especially if you’re taking it from a rack rather than the ground, as we are today.View image in fullscreen‘Every time you deadlift, give it your all’ … Joseph checks Daoust’s form.Photograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianIf you’re new to the game, or need to warm up for a session, you’ll probably want to try a few lifts with just the bar. It’s still 20kg, remember.I’ve already warmed up, though, and this is not quite my first rodeo, so we start with two 10kg plates, making a total weight of 40kg. The bottom of the plates is just resting on the ground, but this lifts the bar enough that I don’t have to bend too much to get my hands around it in an overhand grip. If I had longer legs, or shorter arms, I might have had to raise it off the ground a little. I’ll be holding it barehanded as the weight is light and I have a strong grip, but if needed I could dust my hands with chalk, or use lifting straps. There’s no shame in giving your grip some help if it’s all that’s standing between you and a personal best.Take your time over your set-up. Wherever you feel your hips should be, raise them a couple of inchesFirst, though, my feet need to be in the right position. For conventional deadlifts – which is what we’re focusing on today – that’s pointing forward (it’s OK for them to be turned outa little) and roughly shoulder width apart. But only roughly. “I always say you should be in your ‘power stance’,” Joseph tells me. “If I said to you, ‘Phil, for a million quid I want you to jump as high as you can’, that’s how your feet should be. You shouldn’t be too wide and you shouldn’t be too narrow, but the precise position will be different for different people.”You also want to be close to the bar. “Feet in your power stance, laces underneath the bar. You want your shins to be almost touching it. We want the bar, the weight, to travel the shortest path – straight up and straight down. It’s us that gets in the way or out of the way. The closer it is to us, the more easily we can control it, the more we can harness that power.“Now,” Joseph says, getting into position to demonstrate, “you start with a little hinge and push your bum back. Then you bend your knees as much as you need to reach the bar. For me, that’s quite a lot – I’ve got short arms and short legs. At this point, your shins might touch the bar, but that’s OK. As long as you’re comfortable with that, that’s fine.“Then, when we’re here, we need to build tremendous tension in our body.”View image in fullscreen‘If I could only do one exercise in the gym ever again, deadlifts are the one I would do’ … Cali Joseph.Photograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianAnd how do we do that? “First of all I’m going to bring my shoulders towards the ceiling and lock out my arms as much as I can. Then it’s chest up, shoulders back. And now my last little cue: elbows in. I internally rotate my elbows to take out the last bit of slack that I may have in my body.” This rotation has the effect of engaging your lats, or latissimus dorsi muscles, which sit below your shoulder blades and cover most of your back.That back, by the way, should be flat during your lift, or at least flattish. “Don’t get too hung up on the perfect-looking deadlift,” says Taylor. “I used to spend hours poring over my videos trying to have a perfectly flat back. Now I’m a round-back puller. Deadlifts look different for everyone, depending on proportions.”That doesn’t mean all the rules can go out the window, though. “Take your time over your set-up,” Taylor says, “and wherever you feel your hips should be, raise them a couple of inches. A lot of people seem to want to start too low.”And now you’re finally ready for the lift. “The only difference between when we’re set up and when we’re actually lifting the weight,” says Joseph, “is the little push that we give to the ground to shift it.”The little push? Aren’t we actually pulling the weight up? It might seem that way, but the conventional deadlift isa pushandpull movement. It’s a push from your quads that straightens your knees and gets the bar moving past them; then comes the pull, as you thrust your hips forward and your hamstrings, glutes, back and arms come into play.That hip thrust is a vital part of the deadlift, and the one that most clearly distinguishes it from the squat. But you can only thrust your hips forward on the way up if you have first thrust them back on the way down. One cue that PTs sometimes give, Kummerle says, is: “Pretend your booty hole is a flashlight and shine it backward.” You’ll also hear: “Pretend you’re pushing a car door shut with your bum.”There’s no getting away from bums with the deadlift. From set-up to finish, Joseph sums it up like this: “Bum back, bend knees, arms long, chest up, shoulders back. Then push into the ground.Push, push, push, push, drive hips forward – and that’s the pull.”“Every time you deadlift,” she adds, “you give it your all. I don’t care if it’s your warm-up sets, or it’s your heaviest: we lift with intent.” That’s even the case when you’re deadlifting a person, as she demonstrates when she picks me up for the sake of these photographs. As her human barbell, I can only say I’m glad she takes it seriously.“Sometimes I have to have a mental battle to be in the right frame of mind to attack the bar,” says Taylor, though let’s not forget that sometimes she’s lifting almost three times her bodyweight. “If you’re not 100% committed to making it move, it won’t. In case of emergency, banging music can help.”View image in fullscreenWider stance … Daoust tries a sumo deadlift.Photograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianOnce the barbell is up, you can either reverse the movement to lower it, or just drop it. If you’re in a gym, you will almost certainly be using weights that are designed to be dropped.When the time comes for me to show how much I’ve taken in, the answer is: not as much as I should have. “Get a bit closer to the bar,” Joseph tells me. And: “Hip hinge … bum back, bum back!” And: “Bend your knees, bend your knees, bend some more,bend, bend, bend!” And even: “Tuck your chin!”At least, I think it’s “tuck” she says.It’s like whack-a-mole – no sooner have I ironed out one fault than another pops up. The one that survives longest is shrugging my shoulders at the top of the lift – but even that succumbs when Joseph gets me to engage my lats properly. Apparently I need to imagine someone’s trying to tickle me.Eventually I’m looking solid enough to play around with sumo deadlifts, where your legs go much wider and your arms go between your knees, rather than either side of them. It’s enjoyable enough, but I feel I’m getting distracted from the conventionals just as I’m beginning to get the hang of them. So back we go to my “power stance” and Joseph increases the weight to 80kg.This feels significant, as it’s what I weigh, give or take a kilo. And as I struggle to lift the barbell, I get a glimpse of why this exercise means so much to so many people. As Taylor puts it: “Heavy lifts feel like they take two minutes – and then you watch them back on video and it’s about half a second.” However long the lift really lasts, this weird slowing-down gives you time to feel the strain, think about giving up as you push, push, push and pull, pull, pull, and decide to persevere. You have to commit and stay committed, so that when the lift works out it means something.I recently asked a few people why deadlifts matter so much to them. “They make me feel like I own the world,” one woman told me. “They’re the first time I’ve ever felt strong,” said another. I think I know what they mean.Explore more on these topicsWeightliftingFit for everFitnessHealth & wellbeingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Now there’s a welcome recommendation to restore it across EnglandSun 1 Jun 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 1 Jun 2025 13.36 EDTShareChild health clinics, breastfeeding support, groups for new parents, sleep and weaning workshops, speech and language therapy, drop-in physio sessions, parenting courses in child development and mental health, stay and play sessions (including specifically for dads and male carers), music therapy classes, support groups for women and children who have suffered domestic violence, a housing clinic, groups for children with Send and cookery courses.These are just some of the services available to parents in the borough where I live: Islington, in north London. They exist under the banner of Bright Start, a clever – and I suspect slightly sneaky – rebranding of Sure Start. Sure Start was the Blair government’s leading early years policy, offering area-based holistic support to families with children under five in England (it was Flying Start in Wales and Best Start in Scotland). But since 2010, as a direct result of Tory austerity, 1,416 Sure Start centres in Englandhave closed. Now that the child poverty taskforce is to recommend to the Labour government areturn of the scheme, I thought that it was worth examining what it’s like to live in an area that kept it.I didn’t realise that Islington had retained Sure Start until I took my baby to be weighed at the local children’s centre after the necessity for home visits ceased. There it was, next to the reception desk: a sign reading “Sure Start”, evidence of what had once been a dedicated service for families not just here, but throughout England. Children’s centres offered all kinds of services like the ones listed above, and they also provided childcare to working parents, those in need and those entitled to the free government hours. In Islington, they still do. Of the three closest to where I live, two are rated “outstanding” and one is “good”.Childcare is in high demand in Islington, and childcare places aren’t allocated on the basis of a waiting list but on a complex calculation based on proximity, the age balance of the existing children in the room and staffing ratios. Priority childcare places exist for those who need them most: looked-after children, children whose families are homeless, children whose parents suffer from mental health problems, children with disabilities and other vulnerable groups. Health visitors and other professionals can refer these children to a panel for consideration. It’s one way in which the Bright Start services fulfil their remit of helping the most vulnerable families in the borough, an ethos that underpinned the very reason for Sure Start’s existence.I owe so much of my experience of early parenthood to Bright Start. As someone whose family does not live close, feeling part of a community has been vital to my wellbeing and to my son’s. Like many others, we do not own our flat and we live in an area where we are increasingly surrounded by millionaires (Islington has lots of very rich people in it, but also shocking levels of child poverty). That feeling of community becomes even more important in such a divided borough. Just knowing that there are people there who can help when things get tough means so much. In the three years since I had my son, we have accessed various forms of support, from health visitor advice to sleep and weaning workshops, not to mention some of the best therapy I have ever had.I highlight these things not to boast, but because it’s important to emphasise the postcode lottery of parenthood that exists in the UK. Were I a parent living in a borough without these services, I expect I would feel angry reading about the support that exists elsewhere, because everyone should have access to them. Many local authorities do their best and charities try to plug the gaps, but there is no replacement for fully integrated early years services. The Institute for Fiscal Studiesrecently foundthat the positive impacts of Sure Start were widespread and “remarkably long-lasting”, producing better health, education and social care outcomes for families who enrolled in the programme.It may sound obvious, but when services are integrated, they communicate better with one another. Referral pathways are more straightforward; professionals understand the systems they are working in and are able to signpost other services that might help specific children and their families, such as benefits and housing advice. If a child has a nursery place and needs an education, health and care plan for when they start school, the parents do not have to apply for this themselves. Supporting and safeguarding those who are vulnerable is less challenging because, with a proper safety net around them, people are less likely to drop off the map, or to feel that no one is looking out for them.Seeing how these services operate first-hand and benefiting from some of them has been, quite simply, amazing. That’s not to say the system is perfect: there are funding pressures and high demand, and gaps in services (to cite one example, Bright Start speech therapists don’t work with neurodivergent children, who are on a different pathway. As a result those children, who arguably need it most, don’t get any one-to-one speech therapy). Nevertheless, it should be a blueprint for Labour, which should reinstate the scheme throughout England.Certainly, it will be a challenge. Concerns raised by agovernment sourceinclude fragmentation of services and cost as barriers to reinstating Sure Start. Neither is a convincing argument. Reintegrating fragmented services may be a challenge, but that doesn’t mean it isn’t worth doing, and the payoff is worth it.IFS analysishas found that Sure Start children’s centres in England generated £2 of financial benefits for every £1 spent. We know that supporting the youngest in society from the outset means less pain, less social exclusion and less cost later on. More than that, it is simply the right thing to do. Senior Labour figures should visit one of Islington’s children’s centres and see for themselves how wonderful they are.Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsChildrenRepublic of ParenthoodParents and parentingFamilycommentShareReuse this content"

A chunk of Kleines Nesthorn mountain’s peak had crumbled, and its rubble hung over the silent, empty streets of Blatten, held back only by the glacier. The ice groaned beneath the pressure.On Wednesday afternoon, in an instant,it gave way. The ice cracked, then crumbled. The entire mass descended into the valley below, obliterating the village that had been there for more than 800 years.“Blatten has been wiped away. Erased, obliterated, destroyed, stamped into the ground,” the village’s mayor, Matthias Bellwald, said on Friday. “The memories preserved in countless books, photo albums, documentation – everything is gone. In short, this is ground zero for Blatten.”Moment glacier partially collapsed, burying part of the Swiss villageMoment glacier partially collapsed, burying part of the Swiss village.Looking down from the slope above where the village once lay, you can still see the peaks of a few houses, piercing the mud. The valley is a lush sweep of green, pricked with wildflowers that have thrived on Switzerland’sunusually long, warm spring. But its pasture is now bisected by an enormous brown-grey mass of dirt, ice and rock, dozens of metres thick and about two kilometres long. The avalanche hit the valley with such force it has washed up the other side like a wave in a bathtub.map v2Almost all of the 300 residents had been evacuated a week earlier after authorities grew concerned about the stability of the mountain. One 64-year-old man, believed to have stayed in the area, is missing. As Blatten’s people shelter in the adjacent villages, gratitude for having escaped alive is mixed with grief at the enormous loss: of homes, businesses, history. “The people have lost everything, except for what they are currently carrying on their bodies,” Bellwald said. “Houses, bridges, real estate – they no longer exist.”The scale of the glacial landslide that hit Blatten is near unprecedented in the Swiss Alps. But glaciers and permafrost are melting and destabilising across the world. As they do, terrain that was once frozen solid iscrumbling and sinking. Some glacial lakes are overflowing, and rivers of ice that have endured for millions of years are cracking, shrinking and being loaded with debris. How these mixed structures of earth and ice will behave in a rapidly warming world is unpredictable. Those that collapse can send great waves of water, rock and ice downhill, obliterating everything in their path.View image in fullscreenA large part of the village of Blatten was buried under masses of ice, mud, and rock.Photograph: Jean-Christophe Bott/EPA“What you’re seeing is [happening] all over the world,” said Jan Beutel, a computer engineering scientist who specialises in seismic monitoring of mountain systems, as well as a mountaineer who knows the slopes surrounding Blatten well. He had been keeping a loose eye on the Birch glacier for weeks, and had a live stream running in the background as he worked on Wednesday – listening to its cracks and grumbles.As the noise grew, Beutel watched the collapse in real time. “Suddenly, I saw the pixels exploding in the top half of the screen. I was just in awe,” he said. The impact was akin to a bomb going off. As the lens was obscured by the dust cloud, he searched for seismic data to estimate the size of the rockfall – and found it had registered as a 3.1-magnitude earthquake, one of the largest mass movements of earth ever recorded by the Swiss Seismological Service.“For sure, there will be more. There will be harm to infrastructure, to livelihood, to interests,” he says. “The same thing is taking place in all mountain areas. The glaciated areas are going back. The sustained snow cover is less over the years, and permafrost is warming at a global scale.”Stéphane Genoud, who lives in Anniviers, a short distance from Blatten, spoke during a pause from working to clear his property of broken trees – their trunks cracked by a year of unusual, sporadic dumps of snow. The Blatten disaster is only the latest and most dramatic of the changes that have transformed these valleys over his lifetime. “The change is very rapid,” he says. “We have less and less snow, the glaciers are all retreating, the ice that solidifies the rock is melting. There are routes in the high mountains that are no longer accessible.”View image in fullscreenPeople observe and take pictures of the massive landslide that threw masses of rock, ice and scree down the mountainside into the valley.Photograph: Fabrice Coffrini/AFP/Getty Images“An entire village disappearing under ice and rock is obviously not normal,” Genoud says. “Imagine your village disappearing, under meters of scree. There is no village. In two minutes: the village is gone.”But he believes the collapse is part of a far larger disintegration, as global heating accelerates. “Now, with climate change, the mountain is coming down,” he says. “We are the canary in the coalmine – we are directly feeling the impact.”Even for those who spend their careers monitoring glaciers and their retreat, these sudden, catastrophic collapses are shocking. “I’ve been astonished by the large-scale collapse and detachment of glaciers that has occurred in different parts of the world in recent years,” says Andrew Mackintosh, a glaciologist and professor of earth science at Monash University in Melbourne. “This is not something that I anticipated, particularly situations where entire glaciers detach and then fall into the valleys below.”Often, the people living beneath were not as lucky as those in Blatten, which was almost completely evacuated before the collapse. During the 2002 Kolka-Karmadon glacier collapse in the Russian Caucasus mountains, more than100 million cubic metresof ice and rock plummeted into the valley, depositing debris 130 metres thick. It completely buried the village of Nizhniy Karmadon,killing at least 120people. In Italy, 11 died in the collapse of part of the Marmolada glacier in 2022. In Kyrgyzstan that same year, a group of British tourists were engulfed –but survived– an avalanche caused by the collapse of a glacier in the Tian Shan mountains.ForSwitzerland– a country used to managing significant natural hazards from its mountains – the devastation of Blatten represents a new kind of destruction. When the Swiss president, Karin Keller-Sutter, returned from a helicopter flight over the damage on Friday afternoon, she said the sight was “apocalyptic”.View image in fullscreenSwiss president Karin Keller-Sutter (left) with Franziska Biner, a councillor in the Swiss canton of Valais, after a helicopter flight to survey the damage.Photograph: Fabrice Coffrini/AFP/Getty Images“It’s practically levelled. There have always been landslides. But with those, something always remained. Here, nothing is visible any more.”Precisely attributing the Birch glacial collapse to climate change is not yet possible: even attribution studies for extreme weather take weeks or months, and landslides add an additional, complex set of factors to analyse. A recentreview of 45 studiesof landslides in the alps found a clear link between the heating climate and increased smaller rockfalls or landslides – but for huge rock avalanches, there was not enough data to conclusively say. Exact attribution is almost beside the point, however, says Mackintosh: the climate crisis is already clearly destabilising alpine environments, and transforming entire ecosystems.“The melting of mountain permafrost – frozen ground that literally glues together the high alpine summits – leads to unstable situations where whole mountain slopes can collapse under their own weight,” sayssaid Mackintosh. In temperate glaciers, this can create a kind of feedback loop: the blanket of rock that coated Birch glacier speeded its melting. “These processes lead to a condition where a catastrophic landslide of rock, ice and snow is possible, with devastating consequences.”From the hiking tracks that twine around the mountain above Blatten, the scale of that devastation is clear. Other than a few crested rooftops, nothing remains. The valley is mostly silent, broken by birdsong and the growl of a helicopter above the debris, watching for any movement. Authorities say there is no timescale for accessing the site: it is still too unstable. The sea of rock that covers it is threaded by tracks of water. When the landslide hit, it dammed the Lonza River, which ran through the valley, and regional authorities feared “a torrential lava flow if the river overflows”. Now the water has begun to eat its way through. In Kippel, which lies just a few minutes drive from Blatten, locals gathered to watch the new flow of brown, roiling water wind through the valley below.View image in fullscreenThe village of Blatten pictured on 23 May 2025, left, and one day after the glacier collapse, right.Composite: Jean-Christophe Bott/EPANone of Blatten’s evacuees, other than town officials, have yet spoken publicly about the loss of their town. “You can imagine, this was a very quiet, closed, introverted place even before,” says Brigitte Burgisser, who manages a meditation centre in neighbouring Kippel. “Now, there is such grief as well.”The tiny, tight-knit community hope to rebuild – the valley without Blatten is “unthinkabl”, says Bellwald – but where or when they can do so is not clear.For now, the only version of Blatten village that exists is invisible, Bellwald says, held in the minds of the people that have left. “We carry that with us very carefully, as a memory.”Explore more on these topicsGlaciersThe age of extinctionSwitzerlandEuropeClimate crisisAvalanchesIcefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Forbidding gates and sentry posts restricted access to the exclusive development and its elegant homes. But security here went much further.Each cul-de-sac in the colony had its own individual railway gate, and many of the homeowners had installed gates across their own driveways as well. Anyone coming in or out of those houses would have to clear three checkpoints that set them apart from the wider world beyond.I was astonished. But the security director at the gated community saw nothing unusual in such arrangements. “People shouldn’t be able to just walk into where you live. You should be able to defend yourself against the rest of the world.” Immigration officers were doing exactly the same thing along the country’s border, he added: defending us.I couldn’t help but think about what I had seen in the company of migrant aid volunteers earlier that week in southern Arizona, all the tattered clothes and humble belongings caught in the brush of a desert trail, attesting to the desperation of those who had fled through that harsh terrain.How could people be indifferent to such suffering, I asked one of the volunteers. “It’s like talking to a wall,” he replied.What I learned from an unlikely friendship with an anti-maskerRead moreOver the last eight years, I have crisscrossed the United States as an anthropologist, trying to make sense of why the rifts in our national culture run so deep. I have talked with homebuilders in North Dakota and activists for housing justice in north Texas, with diesel truck enthusiasts in Iowa and pedestrian safety planners in Florida, with white nationalist demonstrators inTennesseeand environmental justice organizers in the Hudson River valley. I have logged many thousands of miles on local highways and country roads, striking up conversations with strangers on park benches and in derelict shopping malls.I recount those travels and their lessons in my new book,Something Between Us: The Everyday Walls of American Life, and How to Take Them Down. In it I argue that, in the US, we are at crossroads, poised between a politics of suspicion and retreat, and another founded on more expansive relationships of mutual aid and collective solidarity.In the many conversations and encounters that led this book, I tried to approach people on their own terms, paying heed to their everyday commitments and concerns, often very different from mine. I have come away with a much better understanding of why things are as stuck as they are, and what it would take to truly change them.The challenges are real, as I saw one October in Shelbyville, Tennessee.View image in fullscreen“How are you feeling?” I asked the Nepali woman behind the counter of a gas station. She replied with a single word and a tight-lipped smile. “Scared”.Scheduled that Saturday morning in Shelbyville was a“White Lives Matter” political rally. Businesses downtown were shuttered. Police had cordoned off roads heading into the town. A pervasive thrum was in the air, from helicopters circling overhead. Dozens of officers in riot gear massed on the roofs of low buildings.The October 2017 rally followed the “Unite the Right” rally in Charlottesville, where clashes between demonstrators and counter-protesters left dozens injured and one young woman, Heather Heyer, dead. The Shelbyville rally was organized by a southern separatist group called theLeague of the South, working with a larger umbrella of white nationalist groups called the Nationalist Front.“Which side are you on?” an officer asked as I approached the site. Long metal barricades divided the white nationalists from the counter-protestors who were also gathering that morning. I followed a handful of journalists into the security clearance area for the white nationalist demonstrators. I was hoping to talk with some of them, to try and understand why they had come to think of their own wellbeing in such starkly racist terms.Everyone was forced to mill around the checkpoint and submit to a pat down in the name of safety. The process was long and arduous, so much so that it helped break the ice between a brown ethnographer and the white nationalists in his midst. Here was something we could complain about together, as if this was a painfully slow line at an airport terminal.View image in fullscreenWhite nationalists attend a ‘White Lives Matter’ rally on 28 October 2017 in Shelbyville, Tennessee.Photograph: Scott Olson/Getty ImagesI struck up a conversation with a bearded man who worked at a uniform factory in northern Alabama. He was wearing a red Maga cap, with an American flag draped around his shoulders – flagpoles had been banned. He admitted feeling stupid with a flag on his back. “What would look cool is a Swat vest and a gun,” he suggested, eyeing the officers nearby.Some of the demonstrators came down to the checkpoint in quasi-military formation, with helmeted young men in rows marching behind plastic shields as a ruddy-faced man with a thick white beard led them in a chant: “Closed borders! White nation! Now we start the deportation!” When they halted, I could see that some of them had swastikas and the letters “KKK” tattooed on their arms.Styled as foot soldiers, many startlingly young in age, these men were a deliberately provocative spectacle of fascist unity. They were also a minority among those who gathered for the white nationalist rally in Shelbyville. That left me curious about the other demonstrators who had joined in plain clothes. How did these ideas speak to them?I fell into conversation with a tall white man in a black Carhartt jacket. He didn’t want to divulge who he was, and nor, frankly, did I, but it turned out that he was raised in Brooklyn, not far from the Bronx borough where I was born. In his late 40s, with a salt-and-pepper beard, he had gone to the rally in Charlottesville and had come to Shelbyville for this event.What seemed to have gone missing here was the faith that one could live alongside others unlike oneself“I have an affinity for this side,” he admitted. I introduced myself as a writer, and we wound up getting into a long discussion.“What do you think of this idea of an ethnostate?” I asked the man, bringing up the vision of a Balkanized white nation floated by rally organizers. “What would you do with people like me?”“What’s your heritage?” he asked.“My family is from India,” I said. “I was born and raised in this country, but my parents immigrated here.”“Aren’t you guys Aryans?” Both of us laughed uneasily.He asked when my family had come to the United States, adding that he had ancestors who came here during the revolutionary war era. “Our ancestors built this country for their posterity. We feel this is our inheritance.”“Let me tell you why I’m here,” I told him. “In the 1970s, there was a shortage of doctors in the United States. The government put out a call, and a whole bunch of them came from India. My dad’s a cardiologist. Over the years, he’s taken care of thousands of patients, saved a lot of lives. Does that give us a place here, or not?”“Yeah, that’s a part of our history,” he replied. “We can accept that. We can absorb a certain amount of other cultures.” The way he spoke, he seemed to be thinking of a national organism, its ability to tolerate some degree of foreign bodies in its midst.Still, the man from Brooklyn insisted, “there’s no living with the other.” What seemed to have gone missing here was the faith that one could live alongside others unlike oneself, sharing a collective life with them rather than living at the other’s expense.“You gotta put your own air mask on first,” he said. “You gotta take care of yourself before you can take care of someone else. You can’t help people if you cut your own throat.”View image in fullscreenPlaces of belonging can be conceived in defensive and xenophobic ways, as that white nationalist rally had in Shelbyville. But they can also be imagined and sustained in a more hopeful manner, as shared spaces of cultural resistance and transformation.I think, for example, of the members of theDenton Women’s Interracial Fellowshipin north Texas, who led the effort to desegregate their town in the 1960s. I was privileged to meet some of these courageous women during my research.At the turn of the 20th century, the Black community of Denton was anchored in a prosperous enclave at the heart of the town, known asQuakertown. Like many other Black townships at time, Quakertown had thrived, with a school and many churches and businesses. Then, in the early 1920s, white civic leaders in Denton led a campaign to appropriate the Black township’s land, raze its buildings and place a public park for white families there instead.Many Black families were forced to leave Denton altogether, for other towns and states or farther afield. Those who remained rebuilt their community once again on a tract of land south-east of the town, past flour mills and two sets of railway tracks, a distant periphery that remains the nucleus of Denton’s Black population to this day.I met Alma Clark for the first time at the American Legion Senior Center in south-east Denton in 2017, when she was 89 years old. She scoffed at the ideas of health and sanitation used as rationale for Quakertown’s removal. “We went into the homes of white folk and cooked their food and cleaned their houses. We took care of their children. We were good enough for that,” she told me with a tart smile.However much labor the Black women and men of Denton contributed to the wellbeing of the town’s white residents, they had been cast into a space of public neglect. Under these circumstances, families in the community turned to strategies of collective support and caretaking.Women relied on one another to help with their children, as they juggled work and other responsibilities. Families added rooms to their own homes to house Black students admitted to Denton’s universities but denied a place in their dormitories.In the 1960s, Clark and other Black women in Denton came together with some white women in the town to create what came to be known as the Denton Women’s Interracial Fellowship. They began by opening their homes to each other, sharing meals for the first time. Eventually, their conversations led to public campaigns that drew dozens of active women in the town. The organization ensured that its membership remained Black and white in equal measure at any given time, and alternated its meetings regularly between Black and white homes.View image in fullscreenA 1994 photograph from the Denton Record-Chronicle documenting a 30th-anniversary Denton Women’s Interracial Fellowship meeting.Photograph: Denton County Office of History and CultureWomen in the fellowship made visible the harsh realities of racial segregation. They led a successful campaign to pave south-east Denton’s streets and equip them with streetlights. They organized voting drives to register new Black voters, and took to visiting local restaurants in interracial pairs to support their desegregation. They distributed cards that encouraged Denton city residents to sign a “good neighbor pledge” that affirmed the right of every person to rent, buy or build a home anywhere they wished, even as social and economic forces conspired to keep people mostly where they were.The legacy of the Women’s Interracial Fellowship remains widely visible in Denton today. A vivid mural depicting Clark and several other Black women activists with the organization spans both sides of the railway underpass leading into south-east Denton. An art installation commemorating their work for racial justice adorns a small downtown park, close to the central courthouse square from which aConfederate monumentwas finally removed in 2020. Contemporary antiracist organizing in the Black Lives Matter era has drawn from historical struggles in the town, on the more inclusive vision of home and community that activists have long summoned.“We had to help each other to survive,” Clark recollected to me in 2022, when I returned to Denton for theJuneteenth celebrationthat year.She went on to add a striking analogy. “It’s like making cornbread. You need meal, you need flour, you need baking powder, you need eggs. You need to put all those ingredients together to make that cornbread. You can’t do anything if you keep them separate.”View image in fullscreenAll of us have much to lose in the erosion of neighborly concern, the impetus to look out for others we don’t know that well. Neighborliness is a powerful image of collective belonging, especially in a world where relationships span the globe and the consequences of how we live extend to many distant and unseen places.In saying this, I don’t mean to idealize American neighbors and neighborhoods. Contemporary patterns of isolation draw on deep histories of racial segregation and systemic neglect in the United States, lines that have long been drawn between lives that matter and lives that don’t. At the same time,neighborlinesshas also long been practiced as a more expansive form of conviviality, equipping people to live with the reality of social difference and disagreement.One afternoon a few years ago, passing through a small town in southern Michigan, I went out to a park to catch up on some notes and phone calls. After some time, a white man in his 60s sat down on the bench beside me, and we fell into conversation. He was slightly drunk, a little red in the eye, and keen to talk. He had recently retired from work as a mechanic at a nearby plant. His wife was ailing, mostly bedridden at home, and he was worried about her medical care.I can’t remember how the subject of politics came up, but he told me that he had voted for Donald Trump in 2016. He also wanted me to understand that this didn’t change what he owed me as a newcomer to his town. No, he didn’t know me from Adam, but our meeting was the Lord’s blessing, he told me, and I ought to have someone around there to call on in case of trouble.He scribbled down his number and address on a scrap of paper and insisted that I take it. “I don’t care if you’re brown or red or whatever,” he told me, and I believed him.The problem lies less with the strangers among us than the strangeness withinI was heading out the next morning, but I kept thinking about that unexpected gesture of kindness. It was like a flash of some other solidarity that still remained possible. I picked up a pie at a market nearby, meaning to drop it off for that man and his family. When I pulled up at the address he had shared, the shades were drawn, and no one seemed to be home. I left the pie and a note on the concrete landing of that small tract house clad in blue vinyl siding.I felt a bit nervous and exposed, walking back to my car. I was, after all, a stranger. But it felt like the right thing to do. He had treated me like a neighbor, and I wanted to reciprocate.Such aspirations will face serious tests in the years to come. How will people respond to the deportation of families who have lived beside them for decades, or the gutting of hard-won protections for clean water and air, or the removal of books meaningful to the most marginal members of their communities from local school curricula, or the deepening of media foxholes that celebrate masculine aggression and disdain for the struggles of others elsewhere?Xenophobic and authoritarian politics draw their power from a fear of foreigners and strangers, an idea that the dangers they pose are already around us, needing to be identified and rooted out. Butas Toni Morrison observed, such ideas often reflect “an uneasy relationship with our own foreignness, our own rapidly disintegrating sense of belonging”. The problem lies less with the strangers among us than the strangeness within, the consequences of a feeling of radical estrangement from the world.In my writing, I try to show howeveryday structures of isolation– at home and on the road, for the body and the mind – magnify the social and political divides we lament so often. These interlocking walls of everyday life sharpen the divide between insiders and outsiders, making it hard to take unfamiliar people and perspectives seriously, to acknowledge the needs of others and relate to their struggles.So much turns on the edges between the familiar and the foreign, these lines we’ve come to live with on a daily basis. Can we learn once again to take these edges as spaces of encounter, rather than hard divides between ourselves and the world beyond?It may be daunting, the idea of making a common life – in public space, in the pursuit of wellbeing on an imperiled earth, even in the unpredictable span of a conversation – with others unlike ourselves. But we need to find our way back to the communion we may share with those beyond our bounds.We need to rekindle that open spirit of kinship once again.Anand Pandianis Krieger-Eisenhowerprofessor ofanthropology at Johns Hopkins University.

It was the shortest tenure in the role since Christopher Eccleston did just one series in 2005, and even within his brief run there was more than one episode where Gatwa barely featured.But without doubt the first Black actor to lead the show left his mark on the role – an incarnation with a winning smile, the catchphrase “babes”, relentless enthusiasm, and without the emotional baggage that was increasingly weighing down his predecessors. He departed with joy.Doctor Who finale sees Ncuti Gatwa depart in surprise regenerationRead moreWith episodes like this, it is very much about enjoying the ride as it rushes from scene to scene, without worrying too much about whether the actual plot makes sense. That may not be the kind ofDoctor Whoeverybody wants.The scene between Gatwa and the returning Jodie Whittaker was beautifully played. The lines about the 13th Doctor never telling Yaz she loved her were perfectly pitched by Russell T Davies to give closure to the awkward non-committal scenes we saw between Whittaker and Mandip Gill inThe Power of the Doctorfrom the pen of Chris Chibnall.View image in fullscreenBeautifully played … Jodie Whittaker and Ncuti Gatwa as the Doctor.Photograph: BBC Studios/Bad Wolf/James PardonMillie Gibson’s Ruby Sunday again shone in scenes where she was the protagonist rather than the sidekick. Her decision, after everything he had done, to choose the kindness of wishing Conrad (Jonah Hauer-King) happiness, rather than vengeance, was one of the most Doctor Who things ever.Archie Panjabi’s take on the Rani, unhinged by the destruction of Gallifrey and the sterility of the Time Lords and unrequited in her feelings for the Doctor was exquisite, and Anita Dobson as Mrs Flood was always a tremendous presence on screen.But if we are talking about unrequited feelings, the surprise return of Steph de Whalley as Anita quickly turned from happiness to see her to experiencing her sadness as we saw her watch the Doctor and Rogue (Jonathan Groff) dancing in the past, and realise that Gatwa was never going to be her man.And so, at the end, a season that gave us bothDugga DooandMr Ring-a-Dingfinished with Billie Piper saying “Oh, hello!”. What a wild nonsensical ride it has been.Sum it up in one sentence?View image in fullscreenWhat a wild ride … Gatwa as the Doctor.Photograph: BBC Studios/Bad Wolf/James PardonWhat if Doctor Who did the weirdest thing it could possibly do and appear to cast a former companion as the lead?Life aboard the TardisBelinda (Varada Sethu) was thankfully back to the spikier version of her that we first met inThe Robot RevolutionandLux, rather than the bland version that appeared in the mid-season episodes, but it appears she has departed the show along with Gatwa. It would have been nice to have more of her.Fear factorThe battle scene which pitted the Avengers tower from Marvel against bone dinosaurs pretending to be At-Ats from Star Wars was hilarious, but in this episode it was really only the brief CGI appearance of Omega that was an alien big bad. If the fear last week was the fear of otherness in a dystopian world, the fear here was that of losing a child – or wanting one but never getting the chance. A very human fear that might hit very differently depending on your own personal circumstances.Mysteries and questionsProbably the biggest mystery is that having introduced a cameo of Carole Ann Ford as the Doctor’s granddaughter Susan two episodes ago, and this episode revolving around whether Poppy was the Doctor’s daughter, that the two were not tied together.It was also surely deliberate that the end credits very clearly said “Ncuti Gatwa as the Doctor. Jodie Whittaker as the Doctor. And introducing Billie Piper” but did not specify who it was introducing her as.And Anita mentioned “the boss”, a reference back to a set-up by the Meep way back in 2023’s 60th anniversary specialThe Star Beast, a story that now appears to be two Doctors ago.Deeper into the vortexView image in fullscreenNcuti Gatwa regenerates into … Billie Piper.Photograph: BBC Studios/PAGatwa’s decision to pronounce Omega differently to everybody around him will surely go down in Doctor Who lore along with Matt Smith’s mispronounced Metebelis III duringHide.Anita opening time doors left, right and centre looking for the Doctor in his past suggests that perhaps in every episode since 1974 some combination of her, Clara’s impossible girl, and Sutekh clinging to the Tardis have all been present. It is getting a bit crowded in the past.I forgot to mention last week that the inclusion of a clip of Kate O’Mara playing the Rani in a flashback sequence lifted from 1993 Comic Relief EastEnders crossover episodeDimensions in Timefinally makes it officially canon.The War Between the Land and the Sea – featuring Russell Tovey, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Jemma Redgrave and Ruth Madeley among others – sees Unit face off against the sea devils, and is expected to be broadcast later this year.Next time?With no confirmed news on the future of Doctor Who, there was a chance this may be the last episode-by-episode recap for some time, or possibly ever? But Billie Piper’s appearance didn’t feel like the end of the series, did it?Either way, I’d like to sign off by thanking all the production staff and comment moderation team that help the recaps happen, the people at the BBC who arrange early access to the episodes and invitations to screenings, you below the line for all your incisive and entertaining comments over the years, and of course, thanks to themuch-loved and much-missed Dan Martin, who got the ball rolling 15 years ago withhis recap blog of Matt Smith debut The Eleventh Hour.

The US president and those around him have long talked up Orbán’s HungaryComposite: GuardianOn a sunny April afternoon in Budapest, a handful of reporters crowded around the back entrance of the Dorothea, a luxury hotel tucked between a Madame Tussauds waxworks museum and a discount clothing store in the city’s walking district.Most had spent hours outside the hotel, hoping to confirm reports that Donald Trump Jr was inside. News of his visit had leaked two days earlier, but much of his agenda remained shrouded in secrecy, save fora meeting with the Hungarian foreign minister.Reports had also circulated of a closed-door speech the US president’s eldest child and Trump Organization executive was slated to give onbridging governments to the private sectorat the five-star hotelreportedly ownedby the son-in-law of Hungary’s prime minister, Viktor Orbán.Few other details emerged from the visit. But it was a hint of the outsized role that this small central European country, home to 9.6 million people, is playing in the US’s political conversation.Trump and those around him have long talked up Orbán’s Hungary, depicting it, in the words of one Hungarian journalist, as a sort of“Christian conservative Disneyland”. The veneration of its alliance of populism and Christianity has persisted, even as the countryplunges in press freedom rankings, facesaccusations of no longer being a full democracy, and becomesthe most corrupt country in the EU.‘In a real sense, US democracy has died’: how Trump is emulating Hungary’s OrbánRead moreAs Kevin Roberts, the head of the Heritage Foundation thinktank that produced Project 2025, a far-right blueprint for Trump’s second term,once put it: “Modern Hungary is not justamodel for conservative statecraft, butthemodel.”Orbán, the prime minister whoonce described Hungary as a “petri dish for illiberalism”, has beenlauded by Trump’s former adviser Steve Bannonas “Trump before Trump”. The US vice-president, JD Vance, oncecharacterised Orbán’s purge of gender studies in academia as a model to be followed.The US president last year called him a “very great leader, a very strong man”. He added: “Some people don’t like him because he’s too strong. It’s nice to have a strong man running your country.”Since Trump began his second term in January, the adoration has seemingly turned to emulationat a frenzied pace. Trump, like Orbán before him, has seized on state powers to pursue rivals, embraced dark rhetoric to demonise political opponents and purge “wokeness” from institutions, in whatanalysts described as the Orbánisation of America.For rights groups, journalists and activists inHungarywho have long pushed back against the steady erosion of rights by arguably the modern world’s most successful populist leader, the parallels are eerie.Over the past 15 years they have challenged a playbook that has now gone global, turning them into a singular source on how Americans – and others around the world – can fight back in the face of democratic backsliding.View image in fullscreenAndrás Kádár: ‘It’s very important to fight every inch of this process.’Photograph: Zsuzsa Darab/The Guardian“Sometimes it might seem kind of tempting to say: ‘OK, we’re just going to make this compromise, and it might go away,’” said András Kádár of the Hungarian Helsinki Committee, a Budapest-based NGO. “But the Hungarian example shows that they always go one step further; we always hit new rock bottoms. It’s very important to fight every inch and bit of this process.”Much of what Orbán is doing follows in the footsteps of Turkey’s Recep Tayyip Erdoğan or Russia’s Vladimir Putin, he said. But one crucial difference explained why Hungary had captured imaginations in the US, Kádár said. “It’s unprecedented in the sense that you have a full-fledged democracy … in the heart of the European Union, which very consciously chose to go this way.”In the course of Orbán’s 15-year rule, there is little his government hasn’t tinkered with. Aftertargeting judgesandrecasting electoral policyto make it harder to oust his party,universities were purged of gender studies coursesandpublic institutions were put under the control of Orbán loyalists.His critics have accused him of using state tenders to line the pockets of loyalists and of wielding state subsidies to reward pro-government media outlets and starve critical media. Some of the weakened media outlets were later snapped up by entrepreneurs loyal to Orbán and transformed into government mouthpieces, with his Fidesz party and its loyalistsnow estimated to control 80% of the country’s media.Throughout it all – in an echo of a strategy that would later be replicated in the US – there was one constant.“This whole process has been going on behind this smoke screen of hate propaganda, with different targets,” said Kádár, pointing to Orbán’stargeting of Brusselsand the EUas well as migrants. “Then they say we need all these powers, these unchecked and uncontrolled powers to protect the people from those enemies inside and outside.”When it comes to the US, many in Budapest highlighted the differences in how things were playing out. “Compared to what’s happening in the United States, here it was rather slow,” said Péter Krekó, the director of the Political Capital Institute thinktank. “So here it’s more like the frog boiling in the water model, while in the United States, I think it’s a coup, practically.”Hungary’s transformation, however gradual, has been striking. At the start of the 21st century, the country was a regional leader when it came to the quality of democratic institutions and their independence. It is now the region’s worst performer democratically, after what Krekó described as the “Hungarian propaganda machine” drilled the government’s line into people.“It’s all over the country, on every billboard, radio spots, on TV. It’s an Orwellian campaign, but on many topics it can shape public opinion very efficiently.”‘We won’t be deterred or scared’: Hungary’s LGBTQ+ community fights for right to march in PrideRead moreWhat had emerged was a country where the notion of who belongs had been recast, said Ádám András Kanicsár, a journalist and LGBTQ+ activist.“The government has an idea of who is a proper Hungarian and who is not,” he said. “And in the last 15 years, this picture has been narrowed down more and more. Right now, you are a proper Hungarian if you have two children, you are white and Christian and have a job, and are living in a happy marriage. And this is the only way to be a good Hungarian.”This year Orbán and his backersbanned all public LGBTQ+ events. Looking back, Kanicsár said the community had long been too passive in asserting their rights.Although the government’s ban led many in the community to speak up, they were now on the defensive, explaining why their hard-won rights needed to be protected, rather than pushing for advances such as same-sex marriage. “They have the narrative now,” he said, referring to the government. “We can’t bring new topics to the table.”The government’s most recent amendment also enshrined the recognition of only two sexes in Hungary’s constitution, wiping out the identities of people such as Lilla Hübsch.“Basically my existence right now is unconstitutional, which is kind of crazy,” said the trans activist as she joined Kanicsár at a bustling coffee shop in Pest, the part of the capital that flanks the eastern bank of the Danube.View image in fullscreenLilla Hübsch and Ádám Kanicsár.Photograph: Zsuzsa Darab/The GuardianFor Kanicsár, it was a reminder of how many in Hungary – and around the world – had long assumed progress was inevitable.“It’s a big mistake. We think that history is a narrow line upwards, that we are always getting better and better, more liberal, more democratic,” he said. “But we can always lose it. And if you have it and you lose it, it can be really hurtful.”The banning of Budapest Pride, just as it wasgearing up to celebrate its 30th anniversary, was a poignant example. “If you have these rights, don’t take them for granted. Cherish them, talk about them and protest for them, because there are always new people who have to hear your message.”When the Guardian visited Budapest last month, sitting down with people in offices, coffee shops, and dining rooms, a note of hope threaded through many interviews.With elections slated for spring 2026, Orbán isfacing an unprecedented challengefrom a former member of the Fidesz party’s elite, Péter Magyar. Several recent polls suggest that, if the trend continues, Orbán could lose his grip on power.“For the first time in 15 years, there is a serious contender,” said Péter Erdélyi, the founder of the Budapest-based Center for Sustainable Media. With hope, however, comes risk: now was, he said, a dangerous moment for anyone perceived to be standing in Orbán’s way.This year the prime minister said he would “eliminate the entire shadow army” of foreign-funded “politicians, judges, journalists, pseudo-NGOs and political activists”, suggesting he could go further than previously used tactics such as smear campaigns, relentless audits and physical intimidation by Fidesz supporters.Orbán’s party seemingly made good on the threat when it put forward legislation that would give authorities broad powers to, in the words of one rights organisation,“strangle and starve” NGOs and independent mediait sees as a threat to national sovereignty.The draft law, said Transparency International,marked a “dark turning point” for Hungary. “It is designed to crush dissent, silence civil society, and dismantle the pillars of democracy,” the organisation said.The Hungarian Helsinki Committee issued a similar warning. “If this bill passes, it will not simply marginalise Hungary’s independent voices – it will extinguish them,” said thhe co-chair Márta Pardavi.The situation in Hungary had been made more complicated by Trump’s ascension to the White House, said Erdélyi.“The US government, almost regardless of who occupied the White House, was a moderating force on authoritarians pretty much everywhere but certainly in central Europe,” he said. “And the new White House, of course, is not only not interested in being that, but it is also turning away from the transatlantic relationship or multilateralism in general.”View image in fullscreenThe rise of Péter Magyar could significantly change Hungarian politics.Photograph: Bernadett Szabó/ReutersMagyar’s swift rise has shaken Hungarian politics, according to Miklós Ligeti of Transparency International Hungary, who credited the politician and his movement, Tisza, for catapulting corruption to the top of Hungarians’ concerns.Through his savvy use of social media andrallies that have drawn thousands, Magyar has repeatedly linked underperforming public services such as healthcare and schools to the country’s soaring levels of corruption.“Now people start to understand that the serious underfunding of these two services is somehow linked to the fact that the government is spending taxpayers’ money on the enrichment of certain business entrepreneurs who have good ties with the government,” said Ligeti.While Orbán and his party had long been able to deflect criticism by pointing to the country’s strong economy, this was no longer the case, sparking questions as to how they keep their grasp on power, said Márton Gulyás, a left-leaning political commentator who helmsPartizán, the country’s most-watched political YouTube channel.View image in fullscreenMárton Gulyás, the host of Hungary’s most-watched political YouTube channel.Photograph: Zsuzsa Darab/The Guardian“I think right now they are in a very dangerous phase, mostly because of the tremendous problems in the economy,” he said. “They’re losing money heavily on debt, inflation is still high, food prices are still high and wages have stagnated.”He said the unprecedented political challenge has been heightened by new models of journalism that had learned to evade Orbán’s heavy hand, from Gulyás’s YouTube channel, which employs 70 people, and independent outlets such as 444, Telex, and 24.hu.Among them was András Pethő, who left his newsroom a decade ago after it became evident the publisher was under growing pressure to toe the government line. When he cofounded the investigative media outlet Direkt36, he knew the model had to be different.“We set up this organisation in a way that would be more resilient against these kinds of pressures,” said Pethő as he drove to Szombathely,a small city in the west of Hungary where Direkt36 was screeninga documentary on the lavish business dealings linked to Orbán’s familysince he took power.The event was an example of how journalists are forging direct, grassroots connections with audiences across Hungary. “We don’t have investors, we don’t have a corporate owner, because we saw that that’s how pressure is exerted,” Pethő said.In recent years there have been many warnings about the Hungarian government’s erosion of democracy. In 2018, it wasaccused of trying to “stop democracy”after it passed a law criminalising lawyers and activists who help asylum seekers.Four years later, members of the European parliamentbacked a reportoutlining why Hungary could no longer be considered a full democracy. Most recently, a delegation of EU lawmakerscalled on Hungary to return to “real democracy”after a visit to the country.Although Hungary may serve as a model of sorts for the US, many in Budapest questioned whether the same impact was possible across the Atlantic.“I think the intention is similar,” said Erdélyi of the Center for Sustainable Media. But Hungary’s economy relies heavily on outside forces; it is not a global superpower. “It’s easy to centralise here because there’s not that much stuff to centralise.”View image in fullscreenPéter Erdélyi: ‘It’s easy to centralise here because there’s not that much stuff to centralise.’Photograph: Zsuzsa Darab/The GuardianThe sentiment was echoed by Zoltán Ádám, a senior research fellow at the Centre for Social Sciences. “Once you build a two-thirds majority in parliament, you are basically ruling the world in this country,” he said. “So you can introduce a monarchy or make Viktor Orbán’s uncle the champion of whatever sports competition – I’m joking, but it’s just half a joke.”This majority allows Orbán and his backers to rewrite the country’s laws at will to serve their own political purposes. “This is a fully controlled country to a large extent,” said Ádám. “This is not totalitarian in the 20th-century sense, this is not a Bolshevik or a fascist system, but all the major institutional actors in the country are actually controlled by the government.”In the US, in contrast, the federal nature provided a built-in system of checks and balances that should protect the country against this sort of threat, said Ádám. “Trump doesn’t control the governor of Massachusetts or the state house of California.”Others questioned how Hungary had come to be seen as a model for the US. “It’s funny because this is a narrative that was built up by Viktor Orbán’s circles,” said a former Fidesz politician who left the party decades ago after becoming disillusioned with Orbán’s leadership.“It’s a story that was sold to the Americans,” said the former politician, who asked not to be named, referring to reports that have alleged that the Hungarian governmentspent millions of euros on intermediariestasked with selling the US a specific image of Orbán and Hungary.“They sold it in a very smart way because they used American terms that don’t have much sense in Hungary,” she said. “So like ‘gender war’, ‘woke’ – there’s no ‘woke’ issue in Hungary. Hungary is much more behind in terms of progressivism than the United States … Hungary’s not even a multicultural country; it’s very homogenous in every sense.”For 15 years she has watched Orbán tighten his grip on power. The longer it went on, the greater Orbán’s motivation would be to cling to power at any cost, she warned. “The system only works for them if they are in power, because they create their own rules. They know that all the rules will change if they lose power.”Her comments came days before it emerged that Hungarian officials hadasked the European parliament, for the third time, to lift Magyar’s immunity as an MEP. Magyar described it as an attempt by Orbán and his party to levy false charges against him and block him from running in next year’s elections.The Hungarian government was approached for comment for this article, but a representative cited time constraints and declined to meet. The possibility of speaking with someone from a government-linked institute was then floated, before the Guardian was told that they would have no time to speak either in person or over the phone.Just how much Orbán and his party’s views line up with those of his counterparts in the US remains a matter of debate. Orbán had long cultivated an image of himself as a stalwart of conservative values, using it as a cover to ease his access to the US administration, said the investigative journalist Szabolcs Panyi.“Orbán just uses this as a smokescreen,” he said. “I think he just invented these pro-family, anti-migration policies; it’s something that he can advertise as a common denominator among all of the conservative groups in the world.”“But in reality, what makes Orbán really powerful and interesting … is everything that is going against the US Republican values and policies,” he added, pointing to Hungary’s full state control of certain industries and Orbán’sheavy reliance on Chinese industry and technology and Russian fossil fuels.In recent weeks,analysts have warned that Orbán’s ties to Trump could begin to work against himif the US president’s tariffs hurt the country’s economy.If Orbán’s hold on power were to be weakened by Trump, it would be a tremendous irony, said Panyi.“It could be Orbán’s tragedy. That by the time that all the stars align when it comes to foreign policy, by the time he reaches that level where he can legitimately claim that his comrades are on the rise and there’s a far-right wave and he’s been spearheading it, at least ideologically, that by that time his domestic support is crumbling.”"

The Tu-95 was originally developed to carry nuclear bombs and now launches cruise missiles.Several Russian and Ukrainian media outlets reported that Ukraine carried out the operation by launching drones from lorries parked near military airfields deep inside Russia.Ukrainian officials told the media that the operation – codename “Spiderweb” – had been in preparation for more than 18 months. The drones were first smuggled into Russia and later concealed under the roofs of small wooden sheds which were loaded on to trucks and driven to the perimeter of the airbases. The roof panels of the sheds were lifted off by a remotely activated mechanism, allowing the drones to fly out and begin their attack, the official said.View image in fullscreenA picture purporting to show the sheds the drones were hidden in.Photograph: Ukraine’s security serviceMedia reports said Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, had personally overseen the sophisticated operation.On Sunday evening he thanked everyone involved, adding: “We had been preparing the operation for more than a year and a half. Planning, organisation, all the details were perfectly prepared. I can say for sure that this is a completely unique operation.”He said that the office of Ukraine’s operation in Russia had been located “right next to the FSB office in one of (Russia’s) regions”.“In total, 117 drones were used in the operation. And a corresponding number of drone operators were working,” he said. “Thirty-four per cent of the strategic cruise missile carriers at the airfields were hit. Our people were operating in different Russian regions – in three time zones. And our people were withdrawn from the territory of Russia on the eve of the operation, and now they are safe – those who helped us.”Photographs from Ukrainian security officials showed dozens of short-range quadcopter drones piled up in an industrial facility. Other images showed the wooden sheds with their metal roofing panels removed, and the drones sitting in the cavities between roof beams.A separate video posted on Russian Telegram channels appeared to show matching sheds on the back of a truck with the roof panels lying on the ground and at least two drones rising out of the top of the sheds and flying off.Mash, a Telegram channel with links to Russia’s security services,published footagethat appeared to show men in Siberia’s Irkutsk region climbing on to one of the lorries in an attempt to prevent drones from launching.View image in fullscreenThe drones supposedly used in the attack.Photograph: Ukraine’s security serviceIn one clip,filmed at the burning airbase in Olenegorskin the Murmansk region, a Russian service person is heard saying: “It’s fucked here,” as several bombers burn in the background.Since the full-scale invasion began in February 2022, Ukraine has been chronically outgunned by Russia in terms of military firepower. But it has developed a nimble and sizeable fleet of attack drones used to strike Russia’s army and energy infrastructure.The Belaya airbase targeted on Sunday in Irkutsk oblast is more than 2,500 miles (4,000km) from Ukraine.The Russian defence ministry confirmed that several of its military aircraft “caught fire” in the attack in the regions of Murmansk and Irkutsk. It added that there were no casualties and that several “participants” had been arrested.In March, Ukraine said it had developed a new drone with a range of 3,000km, without providing further details.Earlier on Sunday, Russian investigators said they believed “explosions” had causedtwo bridges in the border regions of Kursk and Bryansk to collapseovernight, derailing trains and killing at least seven people and injuring dozens. No one has claimed responsibility.Russian investigators were investigating the bridge blasts as “acts of terrorism”, according to state media. The Kremlin said the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, had been briefed throughout the night.Separately, tracks on the Unecha-Zhecha section of railway in Russia’s Bryansk region were damaged without casualties, the national operator, Russian Railways, said.Russia has been hit by dozens of sabotage attacks since Moscow launched its offensive against Ukraine in 2022, many targeting its vast railway network. Kyiv says railways are targeted because they transport troops and weaponry.Russian-controlled territory and most recent Russian advances mapMeanwhile, the Ukrainian air force said Russia had launched 472 drones overnight, the highest nightly total of the war so far, as well as seven missiles. Ukraine’s army said at least 12 Ukrainian service members were killed and more than 60 were injured in a Russian missile strike on an army training unit.Ukraine had previously refused to commit to attending a new round of direct talks in Turkey but on Sunday Zelenskyy said a delegation led by his defence minister, Rustem Umerov, would be in Istanbul. “I have also defined our position before the Monday meeting in Istanbul,” which includes priorities to reach “a complete and unconditional ceasefire” and the return of prisoners and abducted children, Zelenskyy said on social media.Ukraine war briefing: New air assault on KyivRead moreThe US president, Donald Trump, has put pressure on both sides to end the war and threatened to walk away if they do not, potentially leaving Kyiv entirely dependent on European aid.Reuters reported Ukrainian negotiators in Istanbul would present a proposed plan for reaching a lasting peace settlement, with the current frontline as the starting point for negotiations about territory.Citing a copy of the document laying out the Ukrainian position, it said there would be no future restrictions on Ukraine’s military strength, no international recognition of Russian sovereignty over parts of Ukraine taken by Moscow’s forces, and reparations for Ukraine.Last year, Putin set out his opening terms for an immediate end to the war, demanding Ukraine drop its Nato membership ambitions and withdraw all of its troops from all four Ukrainian regions claimed and mostly controlled by Russia.With Reuters and Agence France-PresseExplore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

He said the department received calls at about 1.26pm local time of a man with a weapon near a downtown courthouse and that people were being set on fire.When police responded, they found people with injuries consistent with burns.

Operation Spider’s Web was in preparation for 18 months, with relatively cheap drones targeting strategic Russian aviation.It is also expected to conclude:The UK will commit to building 12 nuclear-powered attack submarines at Barrow in Cumbria and Raynesway, Derby, as part of the three-country Aukus programme with the US and Australia. The first submarines will launch in the late 2030s, replacing seven Astute-class submarines, tasked to operate around the world.A total of £15bn will be invested in modernising the production of nuclear weapons at Aldermaston in Berkshire, supporting more than 9,000 jobs as part of a programme to supply bombs for the Dreadnought submarines that will replace the ageing Vanguard boats that carry the Trident deterrent.That Russia poses an “immediate and pressing” danger posed by Russia while China is a “sophisticated and persistent challenge” to British interests.

But engaging in “nuclear sharing” with the US would be complex, and would require sensitive negotiations with the Trump administration if it were the path chosen.In Europe, B61 bombs remain US property until there is a deemed to be war. At that point, because non-proliferation rules are then deemed not to apply, “the host country puts the weapons on their planes and sets off with them,” according to Dave Cullen, a nuclear expert at the Basic thinktank.Healey declined to comment on air-launched nuclear weapons on Sunday, and no announcement is expected on the issue shortly. The minister instead reiterated the value of Trident. “For over 70 years, our UK nuclear deterrent has been the ultimate guarantee of security in this country. It’s what Putin fears most,” he told the BBC.The defence review is not expected to announce any immediate increase in defence budgets, beyond a commitment to lift spending by about £5bn to 2.5% of GDP in 2027 and to 3% in the next parliament.But Starmer and other Nato leaders are expected to discuss and agree fresh spending targets at a summit in The Hague later this month, of about 5% of GDP, of which 3.5% will be on military spending and the rest on cyberdefence and other infrastructure.Explore more on these topicsDefence policyMilitaryLabourJohn HealeynewsShareReuse this content"

Local and regional directors were to inform Washington “as soon as possible” when situations exist “that have the potential for negative national exposure”.In an email statement, the VA press secretary Peter Kasperowicz said the agency’s policy on publications and public comments “simply requires VA employees to properly coordinate with public affairs staff prior to speaking with the media. Virtually every organization both inside and outside government has similar policies.”The policy “has been in place for several years across both Democrat and Republican administrations”, he said.Ganapathiraju told the Guardian that the article was in full compliance with the VA regulations, which state that employees are encouraged to publish in “peer-reviewed, professional or scholarly journals”. Coordination with public affairs officers is encouraged, but not required, when sharing personal or academic opinions, the rules say.Ganapathiraju said neither he nor his co-author had yet faced punishment. “We have received emails and messages from other VAs across the country (including doctors, department chiefs, chief of medicines, and chief of staff) supporting our article,” he wrote in an email. “No communication from our local VA or from National.”Still, VA workers and veterans advocates say Friday’s warnings fit a pattern of censorship by the Trump administration, which critics say is waging a “war on science”. Since taking office, Trump administration officials have cancelled billions of dollars in grants funding medical research at the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation. Nearly 2,000 leading scientists, including dozens of Nobel Prize winners,signed an open letterreleased in April saying science was being “decimated” by cuts to research and a growing “climate of fear” that put independent research at risk.In his statement, the VA’s Kasperowicz said it is “absurd” to suggest that enforcing the agency’s media policy is part of a “war on science”.Trump issued an executive order on 23 May titled “Restoring Gold Standard Science”. It accused his predecessor, Joe Biden, of misusing scientific evidence when crafting policies on climate change, public health during the Covid-19 pandemic and other issues. Thousands of academicssigned a new open letterthat protested the move, arguing it opens the door to political interference.On 28 May, the secretary of health and human services, Robert F Kennedy Jr, said he wasconsidering barringgovernment scientists from publishing in top journals, including the Journal of the American Medical Association, the Lancet and the New England Journal of Medicine, calling these publications “corrupt”.The Department of Veterans Affairs has long been one of the nation’s most important centers of medical research. Funded by Congress with nearly $1bn annually, VA scientists operate at 102 research sites and are engaged in 7,300 ongoing projects, while publishing more than 10,000 papers in scientific journals last year.VA scientistsinventedthe nicotine patch and the pacemaker and developed the CT scan. The agency runs the National Center for Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, which has pioneered mental health treatments that benefit not only veterans but also rape victims and survivors of natural disasters and other violent crimes.Harold Kudler, a psychiatrist and researcher who served as the national mental health policy lead for the VA under the Obama and first Trump administrations, said the rebuke to the pulmonologists’ article was “powerful in its impact and frightening in the threat it represents”.It was “another attack on freedom of speech”, he said. “Veterans will suffer because of it. Plus, all research programs will take note.”Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS politicsUS militarynewsShareReuse this content"

My brother went with two of his friends. One of them was critically injured in the head, the other was killed, and my brother was shot in the back.”“He was transported to the hospital by a donkey cart – no ambulances can reach the area, and there were dozens of injured and dead,” Naja added. “We saw him placed on the ground. There were no available beds due to the large number of casualties and dead arriving from the same location. The scenes were horrific – people missing limbs, hands or legs, others decapitated, or with open abdomens.”Media reports said dozens of people were being treated at the hospital after the latest incident at thecontroversial site in Rafah. Officials at the field hospital did not say who opened fire but added that another 175 people were wounded.View image in fullscreenBodies of Palestinians being brought to Nasser hospital after Israeli soldiers opened fire on people trying to reach aid points.Photograph: Abdallah F.s. Alattar/ Anadolu/Getty ImagesThe International Committee of the Red Cross said (ICRC) its field hospital in Rafah received a “mass casualty influx” of 179 people, 21 of whom were declared dead upon arrival. “All patients said they had been trying to reach an aid distribution site,” the ICRC added, describing it as “the highest number of weapon-wounded in a single incident since the establishment of the field hospital over a year ago”.Local health authorities said at least 31 of the dead were taken to Nasser hospital.The Red Crescent also reported a further 14 Palestinians were injured near a separate aid distribution site in central Gaza.The Israeli forces denied “firing at civilians”. However, an Israel Defense Forces official admitted that Israeli soldiers fired “warning shots toward several suspects who advanced toward the troops on Saturday”, near the aid distribution site, without specifying who the suspects were.The Israeli-backed aid foundation claimed that it delivered aid “without incident” early on Sunday and has denied previous accounts of gunfire around its sites, which are in Israeli military zones where independent access is limited.US distances itself from Gaza food delivery group amid questions over leadership and fundingRead moreIsraeli forces had given orders that no one should approach the hub before 6am local time. Multiple witnesses said people had begun lining up from 5am, and dozens were said to have surged forward and started running towards it. When the crowds reached the Flag Roundabout, about 0.6 miles (1km) away, Israeli forces started shooting at the crowd, witnesses said.“I went with my brother Shuhada to get food for our children,” Hani Baraka, 43, said. ‘‘The area was very crowded. At the start, a quadcopter drone came and gave orders, saying it was still too early to open the gates and that they would open them at 6am. It seems people moved forward earlier than the time set by the army. The soldiers panicked and began firing at the crowd. My brother was shot in the head and killed instantly.”“On its way back, the drone hit a hanging wire and fell to the ground,” Baraka added. “People rushed toward it, and then the Israeli soldiers opened fire on us. Army snipers surrounded the area and started shooting at the crowd.”The GHF has hired private security firms, but according to witnesses, the private contractors did not open fire on the crowd.“Inside the gate, there were armed American soldiers, but they did not fire at us,” Baraka said. “They only threw plastic stun grenades in the square to scare people and clear the area once the aid ran out.”Reuters footage showed ambulance vehicles carrying injured people to Nasser hospital. Other clips emerged showing people running and ducking, with apparent gunfire audible in the background. One piece of footage seems to have been filmed in the Salah al-Din Road, just south of an aid distribution site in the Netzarim corridor.Doctors at Nasser hospital reported chaotic scenes, with dozens of bodies being brought in.View image in fullscreenBodies of Palestinians arrive at Nasser hospital.Photograph: Abed Rahim Khatib/ Anadolu/Getty Images“The situation in the hospital is catastrophic, due to the massacre of the hungry in Rafah city, near the aid distribution centre,” said Dr Marwan al-Hams, 53, a medic in the emergency department at Nasser hospital. “Most injuries were shot in the upper parts of the body – the head, chest, and abdomen – as the Israeli army was reportedly firing from high altitudes using aircraft or quadcopters. A witness on the scene said that shots were also fired from a crane and from tanks.”The hub is part of a controversial new aid system.On 28 May,Hamas accused Israel of killing at least three Palestiniansand wounding 46 near one of the GHF’s distribution sites, an accusation the group denied. The Israeli military said its troops fired warning shots in the area outside the compound to re-establish control as thousands of Palestinians rushed to an aid distribution site.Israelimposed a blockade on all suppliesin March, saying Hamas was seizing deliveries for its fighters, which the group denies. Earlier this month, a global hunger monitor said half a million people in the strip faced starvation.TheIPC estimatedthat nearly 71,000 children under the age of five were expected to be “acutely malnourished”, with 14,100 cases expected to be severe in the next 11 months.The UN and other humanitarian organisations have rejected the new system for food distribution, saying it would not be able to meet the needs of Gaza’s 2.3 million people and allowed Israel to use food as a weapon to control the population.The latest incident took place as Hamas and Israel exchanged blame over a faltering effort to secure a ceasefire.Hamas said on Saturdayit was seeking amendments to a US-backed ceasefire proposal, but Donald Trump’s envoy Steve Witkoff rejected the group’s response as “totally unacceptable”.Reuters and Associated Press contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warGazaIsraelMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesnewsShareReuse this content"

I thought I was hearing fireworks at first but then saw the noise was coming from someone firing a gun.”A Chinese expat who owns a shop next to the bar said: “I heard a noise coming from next door. I looked out and saw a man pointing at something and shooting.”A worker at a nearby beach bar and restaurant also recounted how families with children took refuge inside after the shooting started. “I didn’t see anything because we focused on crouching down and staying safe, but it was a very frightening experience.

Here we look at the key findings from the module and experts’ recommendations for future pandemic preparedness.1.The role of test, trace and isolationTesting people for infection, tracing their contacts, and isolating those at risk of passing on bugs is a mainstay of outbreak control. The UK could handle local outbreaks such as norovirus, salmonella, mpox and meningitis, but the pandemic called for radical scaling up.At its peak, NHS test and trace was able to process 800,000 virus tests a day. Lateral flow devices bolstered the capacity. Nearly 16 million people who tested positive were contacted, with more than 31 million contacts.2.The quest for a testPublic Health England developed a Covid test within two weeks of Chinese scientists publishing its genetic sequence. The first case in England was diagnosed on 31 January. Scientists knew the outlook was bleak. “It was very clear at that stage that we were heading towards a major event, a pandemic that would have a big, big impact,” Prof Christophe Fraser, who worked on Covid apps in the pandemic, told the inquiry.The UK needed to expand testing fast, but on 12 March nearly all community testing and contact tracing was abandoned. Instead, people with symptoms were asked to self-isolate. Prof Alan McNally, an infectious disease expert at the University of Birmingham, was “flabbergasted”. Days later, the director general of the World Health Organization, Dr Tedros Ghebreyesus, reiterated the call for all countries to “test, test, test”, isolate the infected and test their contacts.3.Was the UK prepared for mass testing?There was no plan for nationwide testing. Ministers and many scientific advisers had focused on a flu pandemic, which might tear through the population too fast for testing to help. “What a catastrophic error that was,” Pete Weatherby KC, for Covid Bereaved Families for Justice, told the inquiry.“It started with no planning, no capacity, no contact tracing, lab analysis or isolation infrastructure for anything other than the occurrence of a limited high-consequence disease outbreak, and perhaps most significantly, too little support for those most likely to spread the virus if they did not test and isolate.”4.Big ships and small boatsRather than building on the expertise and equipment in NHS labs, universities and research institutions, the UK pursued a private, centralised testing programme. It was built “virtually from scratch”, Dominic Cook at Deloitte told the inquiry.The decision had its critics. The Francis Crick Institute in London reconfigured to test its employees, local hospital staff and eventually care home residents. Soon, they were turning up to 4,000 tests a day in 24 hours. “That sort of speed is absolutely critical to protect vulnerable people,” said Sir Paul Nurse, the Nobel laureate director of the Crick. “We could have scaled up to about 10,000 [tests a day] in a month if we’d had the money.”Nurse and others pushed for a Dunkirk-inspired big ships and small boats approach, where the UK’s existing labs provided local testing until the Lighthouse labs were ready. Nurse estimated the UK’s smaller labs could process up to 200,000 tests a day. But ministers had other plans. They sent the army to collect PCR machines for use in the centralised Lighthouse labs. In an email to colleagues shared at the inquiry, McNally wrote: “That’s a massive ‘fuck you’ to the whole of UK academia.”5.Who to test?Early in the pandemic, the NHS listed Covid symptoms as a new continuous cough and high fever. Other symptoms were only added later. It meant many people who had Covid didn’t realise. Prof Tim Spector, who pioneered the Zoe Covid app, flagged loss of smell or taste as a symptom in March 2020. It wasn’t recognised by the NHS until May.Some people with Covid had no symptoms. Fearing that asymptomatic healthcare workers could spread the virus to patients, Nurse and Sir Peter Ratcliffe, another Nobel laureate at the Crick, wrote to the then health secretary, Matt Hancock, to call for testing of all healthcare workers. A response arrived three months later. Weekly Covid tests were not offered to asymptomatic care home staff and NHS workers until July and November 2020 respectively.6.The network of testing centresLocal testing centres popped up from spring 2020 but many failed to consider the most vulnerable. Disabled people found some sites inaccessible. Many centres favoured people with cars. “If you were doing this again, you’d set up your first set of testing sites in local community halls in Tower Hamlets, not in Chessington World of Adventures,” Dido Harding, who led NHS test and trace, told the inquiry.Online booking systems excluded people without computers or mobile phones. People were sent to the nearest available test site, regardless of practicalities. Robin Swann, the former health minister in Northern Ireland, said some residents were directed to Scotland. “The Irish Sea hadn’t been taken into consideration,” he said.7.How effective were the Lighthouse labs?The Lighthouse labs were the powerhouses of the UK’s testing capability. Setting them up was hectic. Beyond the machines needed to test samples, labs needed safety cabinets, trained staff, workflows and operating procedures. Post-doctorate and research fellows volunteered to move, while other scientists were seconded to staff them. McNally helped set up the first lab in Milton Keynes, which ran 28,000 tests a day at the end of its first month. A major frustration was the enormous team of Deloitte consultants, he said, which had “no expertise” in lab work, infectious disease or diagnostics.The need for high standards at testing labs was made clear byfailuresat the private Immensa lab in Wolverhampton. In 2021, it issued tens of thousands of incorrect test results. “In the long list of Covid disasters and scandals, this is pretty near the top,” McNally said.8.Contact tracingEngland alone had to recruit and train 15,000 contact tracers. To be effective, 80% of contacts of infected people had to be traced. In 2020 the figure was far lower. Scores of people avoided tests because they couldn’t afford to self-isolate. Lady Harding pressed for better support but Rishi Sunak, then chancellor, refused “at every opportunity”. Had we done more, fewer would have died, she believed.Diary entries from Patrick Vallance, the former chief scientist, echoed her concerns, saying ministers “always want to go for stick, not carrot”. One note had Boris Johnson, the prime minister, saying: “We must have known that this wasn’t working. We have been pretending it has been whereas secretly we know it hasn’t been.”In a later note, he said: “We haven’t been ruthless enough. We need to force more isolation. I favour a more authoritarian approach.”9.Are we better prepared today?The Lighthouse laboratories were dismantled, the equipment sold off and staff returned to their previous jobs. If another pandemic strikes in December, McNally told the inquiry: “We will be exactly where we were in January, February of 2020.”He and others urged the UK to mirror Germany’s federated lab system where a mix of university, commercial and animal health labs perform routine testing but can switch to pandemic testing when needed.Harding stressed the need for a mass test-and-trace system that considered the most vulnerable from the start. “They’re the most exposed to every infectious disease and that means you have to put isolation support at the forefront of your testing and tracing system,” she said.Explore more on these topicsCovid inquiryCoronavirusHealthInfectious diseaseskey takeawaysShareReuse this content"

Since 2022, its user base has grown by 30% year on year, helped by those looking to observe and perhaps dip their toe into experimental lifestyles.The dating app’s chief executive, Ana Kirova, said reaching a wide audience has never been a goal, and she fears alienating longstanding members.“I do think it’s a challenge that it’s becoming more mainstream in some ways,” she said. “How do we welcome people who’ve never heard of Feeld, who don’t understand the list of sexualities and genders[or] who don’t understand what ethical non-monogamy is?”But she added: “Every time someone tells me about this vanilla people being on the app, I just ask: ‘What’s the problem with vanilla?’ Why are we so binary about it? There is vanilla, which is boring and whatever, and then there is the rest, which is dark and interesting.“We don’t yuck anyone’s yum … and that does count for more traditional relationships and popular sexual experiences, too. I think there is space for that.”View image in fullscreenFeeld describes itself as a dating app for ‘the curious’.Photograph: Koshiro K/AlamyUnlike other dating apps, users are able to browse profiles without gamified swiping “like” and “dislike”, and Feeld does not use AI or predictive algorithms to find matches, which Kirova likens to “shopping for granola”.“That constrains the experience for the members. As soon as you join the app, you’re put on to a conveyor of what your experience should be. And the platform makes a lot of choices for you in order for an algorithm to match you and people, because there is a default assumption for everyone that you’re there to find X,” she added.As a result, she believes there is less – although not no – bad behaviour such as ghosting and “benching” someone in the belief there is someone better a swipe away.However, she added that safety is still a battle. “With toxic misogyny still a challenge in wider society, it inevitably finds its way into the dating app landscape,” she said.There has also been a proliferation of sophisticated romance scams, for which Feeld uses AI to identify fake profiles. “There are big companies that are investing in scammers. It’s like there is Feeld and then there is the ‘dark Feeld’ somewhere, with a lot of people and resources invested into making fake accounts on dating apps … it’s a real difficult thing to tackle,” she said.Feeld has benefited from changing cultural attitudes towards sex, relationships, sexuality and identity, and a shift away from the “linear journey from single to coupled to married to having children to having a house”, Kirova says.She has observed a growing openness. “Older generations look at identity and sexual orientation as quite static. They’re starting to change slowly, but that’s their perception. Whereas younger people see them as ongoing, growing and changing parts of the self.”Kirova said the app’s second fastest growing demographic is women over 40, with numbers rising by 16% last year, thanks to culture and media challenging “silly and offensive” perceptions of older women’s sexuality.Feeld has also managed to hold on to gen Z users, who are turning away from other dating apps. “There is also space for people finding friends and space for people finding community. I think especially gen Z are not always looking for sex on the app,” she said.For the curious: ethical non-monogamy involves having multiple relationships in a fully consensual away, a switch is someone happy to take on either a dominant or submissive role in BDSM, and edging involves delaying orgasm by giving or taking away pleasure.Explore more on these topicsSexDatingAppsRelationshipsnewsShareReuse this content"

After just two series, Ncuti Gatwa’s Doctor regenerated into a grinning Piper, who greeted viewers with a “oh Hello!” in the episode’s final scene.The 42-year-old is best known toDoctor Whofans for playing the Doctor’s companion Rose Tyler for two seasons when the show was reintroduced to TV screens in 2005 after a 16-year break.Her return came as a genuine shock to fans, many of whom were impressed that theBBChad managed to avoid leaks. But it has also left them with questions – will Piper play the Doctor in the show’s next series? And will there be a next series at all?In February theBBC denied reports the show faced the axe– but said any decision wouldn’t be made until the latest series had been broadcast. Its statement pointed out half of the 26 episodes agreed with Disney+ still had not aired. Twenty-one out of those 26 have now aired, leaving a five-episode spinoff starring Russell Tovey, the trailer for which aired after Saturday’s finale.TV critic and Doctor Who fan Scott Bryan, 35, said the reintroduction of Piper to the show came at a pivotal time for Doctor Who, amid speculation about its future. “I think it felt a bit like, towards the end of the episode, a pitch to Disney to say: ‘Hi, please renew us, we’ve got Billie Piper’.”“Of course we’ve not had any confirmation about whether the Disney deal will be renewed, but also when or if these episodes will be aired. Nothing has been confirmed regarding filming. It’s a moment in TV that has raised more questions than answers, but that’s how Doctor Who works.”Concerns have been raised about falling viewing figures, which have struggled to rally since Russell T Davies’ return in 2023. Two episodes during this series, which aired in May, got less than 3 million viewers – the lowest since the modern era began airing in 2005.Doctor Who finale sees Ncuti Gatwa depart in surprise regenerationRead moreThe coordinator of the Doctor Who Appreciation Society, Tony Jordan, 66, from Staffordshire, said he was concerned about the show’s future. “Obviously if it had been a stellar success then they would have recommissioned it already,” he said.“It is a concern that it is not going straight back into production but, to be fair, there have been times since it came back in 2005 where you’ve had a year-long break.”Whether Piper will play her old character Rose, the Doctor or another character is also unclear. The credits, which showed Gatwa and Jodie Whittaker as “the Doctor” did not do the same for Piper.Christopher Eccleston, who starred alongside her as the Doctor,told an event in the US in 2021he backed the idea of his former assistant taking on the role.He said: “I was saying to somebody today in the green room that Russell T Davies is coming back, right, and who’s going to be his Doctor? I think it should be Billie Piper actually. Catherine Tate’s great but, I think there’s your Doctor.”Dan McLaughlin, 30, who was watching the finale with fellow fans at a cinema in Manchester when Piper appeared said: “There was an audible gasp when she came on, definitely. There was maybe about two or three cheers, and someone behind me swore.”Bryan said: “It was a real surprise. I think Billie Piper is fantastic, she was one of the reasons why the 2005 series landed so well and led to 20 years of a hugely successful show and a reboot. But a surprise nonetheless.”He added: “I’m intrigued by what they decide to do with her, and the fact that there’s mysteries around the fact that we don’t know whether she’s playing the Doctor, it’s a bit open ended.”McLaughlin said he felt “deflated” by Piper’s appearance as it indicated a lack of new ideas behind the show.He said: “Billie Piper’s amazing and Rose was a wonderful character, but you want something new now, you want to be excited. I loved [David] Tennant in the 60th anniversary special, but bringing back characters loses its novelty if you just keep on bringing the old ones back all the time. It’s lacking in original ideas.”Explore more on these topicsDoctor WhoBillie PiperNcuti GatwaTelevisionBBCFantasy TVfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Later photograph: Dylan Coulter/The Guardian. Set design: Jamie Dean. Styling: Anna Su. Grooming: Randi Petersen at Art Department using R+Co. Archive photograph: courtesy of Tom DaleyBorn in Plymouth in 1994,Tom Daleyis Britain’s most decorated diver. He was 13 when he made history as Britain’s youngest competitor at the 2008 Olympics, and the following year became a world champion. He won gold at the Tokyo Olympics with his synchronised diving partner, Matty Lee, before retiring from diving in 2024. He is married to the screenwriter Dustin Lance Black, with whom he has two sons. The documentary, Tom Daley: 1.6 Seconds, is available to stream on Discovery+ from 1 June.I used to be obsessedwith wearing tea towels. I’d make sure the fabric was completely lined-up and tucked in neatly. If it was in the slightest bit ruffled or messy, I would get upset and rip it off and try it all over again. This was the beginning of my perfectionism – and possibly the first signs that I might not be 100% straight.My mum says that as a kid, I was very sweet but I knew what I wanted. What did I want? To do the best I could at anything that I tried. That is still my mentality today. If I’m going to try something and it doesn’t work out perfectly, I don’t have tantrums any more, but I do get frustrated. That’s the thing about being an athlete: being good is not enough – you have to be the best. It’s not something you can teach, but every athlete who gets to an Olympic level has that same drive. We know our flaws before anybody else can point them out.I was seven when I started diving. I loved the water but found swimming up and down a little bit boring – diving was much more fun. I started out jumping off the side of the pool, then tried the one-metre. The first time I tried the 10-metre platform I was eight years old. I remember crawling to the edge because I was too scared to walk – the board seemed to reduce in size with every step and suddenly looked like a tightrope. I was peering off into the water, thinking: “There’s no way I can jump off this.” But once I was in the air, there was no going back. It was a surreal and euphoric moment – freefalling for 1.6 seconds. As soon as it was over, I knew I wanted to do it again.My childhood was brilliant.I was always outdoors, and we used to go for weekends away in our caravan in Newquay. I felt very safe, loved and cared for. Because I was so happy with my family, I used to hate travelling for competitions – I would get so homesick. It was terrifying to be on the other side of the planet from your parents when you’re 10 years old – especially when everyone else competing was much older. I can’t imagine how painful it was for my parents to hear their son crying on the end of the phone.Jeff Goldblum looks back: ‘My brother was an interesting dude. When he died it was terrible, monumental’Read moreMy dad Rob was my biggest cheerleader. He would work all day, pick me up from school, take me to the pool and stay all evening until I finished training. He would be there for every competition. We were a team, and it was our dream together. He was great at teaching me about perspective: if I bombed out at a competition, he would say: “You came 30th, but you’re still the 30th best in the world.”When dad died [of a brain tumour in 2011], I went to training the next morning. I carried on competing without a proper break. Maybe it’s a British thing, but me and my family wouldn’t speak about his passing that much. It’s as if we didn’t want to upset anyone, or make them feel uncomfortable. I also felt that I had to be the strong one – the person who could support my family. It was only when I met my husband Lance, and he would ask why I didn’t speak about my dad, that I allowed myself the space to grieve. And it still hits me now, especially when those major milestones happen. He missed me winning my first Olympic medal, my wedding, my first son’s birth.Lance and I metat a dinner in 2013. We talked and talked until we both realised how similar our lives were. He had just lost his brother; I’d lost my dad. He had just won his Oscar; I had just won an Olympic medal. It was the first time I could complain about success to somebody who knew I wasn’t really complaining about success. I was complaining about how to deal with what happens on the other side – the pressure and expectations. Knowing that nothing would ever compare to that feeling again.I met Lance in March and came out to the media nine months later. I don’t think I would ever have said anything about my private life unless I had met someone like Lance. Once we fell in love, I knew I couldn’t keep it a secret. It was absolutely terrifying, posting the video on YouTube, because my management at the time had not been encouraging, and told me that I was going to lose my sponsorship. It was a scary thing to do, but once it was out there I was glad. It took all of the pressure off. I could be me for the first time.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Being a dad was still my priority, so I had to deal with running on low sleep. I went to bed at 8 o’clock, because I didn’t know how many times I’d be up in the night. I’d wake early for training but would make sure I was home to help Lance with bedtime. I always found it incredibly difficult to leave them for competitions, and I carried a sense of guilt with me. My husband is so supportive, and he’s sacrificed a lot for me. But now I’ve retired, it’s his moment. He’s like: “It’s my turn to get my career back on track!”I have been an athletefor most of my life, so it’s taking time to adjust to my new reality. I am so used to being disciplined that even if I’m out for dinner on a Saturday night, and someone asks if I’d like a glass of wine, it takes me a second to realise I am actually allowed to. Food is the same. When I was about to go to the 2012 Olympics, I was told by a coach that I needed to lose weight. After that, I had some issues with eating disorders. At the time it was something that men didn’t really speak about, so I kept it to myself and felt very alone. Once I was able to get the proper nutritional support and learned more about what my body needed, and how to fuel it, then my recovery started to unfold. But in truth, that feedback still affects me today. I know how I can look, and how I did feel, at my peak. Now that I’m not training six hours a day, six days a week, I am never going to be in that same form.When I look at this photo, I think about how innocent I look. The boy in the photo has no sense of what society thinks is right or wrong. I could live and be happy and free. I am so glad my parents were the kind of people who celebrated whoever I was; an Olympian diver or a boy who liked to wear tea towels around his waist.Explore more on these topicsTom DaleyFlashbackMilkDivingOlympic GamesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I was only 13 years old and, when you first start menstruating, you never know when your next period is going to arrive.I was away on holiday with my family, playing in the hotel pool with some new friends I’d just met. There was definitely a boy there I fancied. At one point I hopped out of the pool and suddenly this lifeguard, who must have only been 15 or 16 himself, walked straight up, put a towel around me and said really quietly in my ear, “You need to go to the bathroom.” I looked down and realised why: my period had started.That was it. He said nothing more. Not even my twin sister, who was also in the pool, had any idea what had happened. He was that subtle about it.The kindness of strangers: a woman lay on the road beside me, holding my hand until the ambulance cameRead moreIf he hadn’t done that, it probably would have destroyed my entire holiday. You can just imagine the humiliation of having met a group of cool teenagers you’re trying to impress and suddenly you’ve got blood running down your legs. This was the 1980s – they would have pointed at me and laughed!I will always be grateful to that lifeguard. I’ve always wished that I could go online and find this boy to thank him – or thank his mother more than anything, as she clearly taught him perfect manners. He somehow knew not to make a big deal of it, and how not to embarrass me. It was just done so beautifully.I now have two sons myself and I’ve always said to them, if you ever see a stain on a girl’s dress, take off your jumper, put it around her waist, tell her she needs to go to the bathroom and never mention it again. That day also showed me that kindness doesn’t have to be big, sweeping “look at me” gestures – the smallest acts can be the most impactful.What is the nicest thing a stranger has ever done for you?Share your experienceWhat's the nicest thing a stranger has ever done for you?From making your day to changing your life, we want to hear about  chance encounters that have stuck with you.Please share your story if you are 18 or over, anonymously if you wish.

It was originally an African-American term that means being aware of structural racism. So to suggest it’s gone too far is to suggest anti-racism has gone too far, that social justice has, which it obviously hasn’t. It must be very frustrating for African Americans, that their language gets co-opted. It’s important to remember who it belongs to and not let it be neutralised.Dining across the divide: ‘He asked what I think of Trump.

Her concern is that when you get this intellectual censoriousness of liberal identity politics, the people the left should be serving are excluded.SueIf you over-police and don’t look at context, you won’t have any idea where people are coming from; whether they might be receptive to changing their view. You have to really work to understand what it’s like when you haven’t got a voice.

She speaks with such passion about the young people she’s working with. And I was talking with equal passion about the children I’ve worked with – lack of school readiness is really striking. We had children whose socialisation, speech, potty training, just general physical strength, weren’t where they should have been. They hadn’t got the pincer grip needed to write because they’d used screens and simply swiped.EmmaWe’re both quite anti social media; neither of us use it. We both think young people need to spend more time outside, and we’ve seen negative impacts in the cohorts we teach. Nowadays, students come to university and it will be their first time pushed into independence, very high stakes. I think it affects their happiness.

This is what Labour has left us withSamuel EarleBritain’s most talented opportunist now claims Reform is the ‘party of the workers’. He’s occupying terrain wilfully vacated by Keir StarmerSun 1 Jun 2025 10.44 EDTLast modified on Sun 1 Jun 2025 15.28 EDTShareIn amuch-publicised press conferencelast week in London, Nigel Farage invited Keir Starmer to a one-to-one debate at “a working man’s club” anywhere “in the red wall”. The suggested location was more noteworthy than the debate-me machismo. Its message was clear: having trampled over the Tories in the recent local elections, Reform UK is coming for Labour and nowhere is safe. “Let’s go to one of the former mining communities, let’s go somewhere that Labour has held the seat pretty much consistently since 1918,” Farage said, and then let’s “test” whether Labour or Reform is the real “party of the workers”. If Starmer felt brave enough, they could even “enjoy a few beers with the lads” – a nod to what has always been Farage’s favourite interpretation of what “standing with workers” entails.Farage’s speechmade waves for, among other things, calling for the two-child benefit cap to be overhauled and for Starmer’s restrictions to the winter fuel allowance to be reversed. For the Thatcherite fanboy and former City trader, these were unusual positions, and the Westminster lobby lapped up the controversy – suggesting that, for parts of the Tory press, deviations from austerity will only be permissible when delivered with Farageist chutzpah. “How Farage’s fiery speech signals a seismic shift in UK politics – and the end for Starmer,”the Daily Express declared. “Nigel leans left and hits the bullseye,”Tim Stanley cooedin the Daily Telegraph. The Sun wondered whether they should now call Farage “Red Nigel”.But in reality, rather than represent an unprecedented reconfiguration of British politics, the speech was a typically opportunistic and cynicalintervention from Farage: he noisily supported two policies that mounting reports suggested Labour were set to implement anyway, within a broader message that was far more George Osborne than Jeremy Corbyn. “The great divide that is opening up in British society,” Farage claimed, was between those who wake up early and go to work and those who stay in bed and enjoy a similar quality of life. Workers and shirkers, in other words – same as it ever was.How worried should Labour be by Reform’s overtures to the left? Farage’s star is clearly rising and Reform has already surpassed Ukip’s electoral achievements. Aftertriumphing in the recent local elections, with more than 670new council seatsand a third of the vote, Reform now leads the pack in many national opinion polls. But Labour should first and foremost be worried by itself. Starmer’s government appears to be in a permanently defensive state, commanding an enormous majority in parliament and yet rarely seeming to do more than react to events around it – sometimes left, often right. The prime minister’s personal approval rating has suffered the consequences of this hapless strategy, reaching record lows with38-point dropsince last year’s election. Meanwhile Red Nigel circles like a vulture.The two-child cap is illustrative. Since entering government with the promise of “change”, Labour maintained it would have to keep the policy – a transparently cruel inheritance from Osborne that made child poverty levels soar. Now the party appears increasingly likely to lift the cap, but what could have been a historic moment of rupture with Cruel Britannia – a move that will lifthalf a million children out of poverty, according to the Resolution Foundation – may easily be seen by the public as a reluctant concession to various Labour MPs and now Farage: not an empowered rebuttal of Tory austerity and the dawn of a new era, but yet more flip-flopping and an affirmation of Farage’s influence.In his speech, Farage claimed that Reform represented the biggest revolution in British politics sinceLabourovertook the Liberal party in the 1920s – and there are some parallels. Back then, the Tories saw Labour as both an existential threat and an opportunity: Labour was a foreboding movement, but the Tories could take fleeting comfort in the knowledge that it was the Liberals who would suffer the severest blow. Labour now treats Reform with a similar ambivalence: worried yet reassured that the Tories will be the main victim. But an irreverent and vengeful Farage, powered by grievances and resentment from both deindustrialised Britain and the elite, will have a far more corrosive effect on British politics and wider society than Labour ever threatened.For now, after the fallout of his “island of strangers” speech, Starmer’s strategy to deal with Reform will be tocall out its economics as a fantasy. Farage’s economic programme – binning net zero, waging war on asylum seekers and abolishing inheritance tax – is indeedreminiscent of Liz Truss. But it is not enough for Labour to play the role of the miserly Tories, saying to Reform what the Tories have historically said to them: we can’t afford that, we must live within our means, and so on. Labour needs its own positive vision of the country. For now, the party indulges its own set of fantasies: that it can outflank the Tories and even Reform on the right without being outflanked on the left; that it is enough to be the least unpopular party, no matter how uninspiring one is; and that you can break with the harsh inequities of Tory Britain, as promised, without upsetting anyone important.Before Starmer’s podiums were emblazoned with dispiriting slogans like “fixing the foundations” and “securing Britain’s future” they carried various versions of a more optimistic one: “it’s time for change.” A major reason for its massive majority in 2024 was that, after 14 years of joyless Conservative misrule, Labour better embodied that spirit of feeling than any other party. But unless Labour can show they are that change from the Tories – and that will involve taking Britain beyond its overfed interests in tightening immigration controls and the welfare state – this spirit of feeling will only endure and deepen, and the answer to it will no longer be Labour.Samuel Earle is the author of Tory Nation: How One Party Took OverExplore more on these topicsKeir StarmerOpinionLabourNigel FarageReform UKcommentShareReuse this content"

It’s so much nicer if you’re a manEmma BeddingtonEver since lockdown we’ve supposedly all been in it together, doing conference calls in our slippers. But in straight couples, guess who gets the spare bedroom and the proper desk?Sun 1 Jun 2025 09.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 1 Jun 2025 10.24 EDTShareI’m wary of gendered generalisations. They rightly raise hackles: we are unique, not defined by gender, not all men! But I was struck by one I read from Ella Risbridgerin her reviewof Jessica Stanley’s recent novel, Consider Yourself Kissed. Exploring one of its themes, Risbridger wrote: “I have long noticed that in a house with one spare room and a heterosexual couple who both work from home, the spare room is where he works – with a door that shuts and perhaps even a designated desk – and she workssomewhere else. (Always for good reasons, butalways.)”This stopped me in my tracks. Not because it’s my experience: my husband and I are lucky enough to have an office each, and mine is bigger and objectively nicer. I get the garden view; he has the ballet of Openreach and Amazon vans. (See – not all men.) It’s not Stanley’s experience either: she uses the spare bedroom; her husband has half the living room, she toldthe Cut’s Book Gossip newsletter.Rather, I was struck because having just read the Australian writer Helen Garner’s recently published diaries, How to End a Story, this is exactly the irreconcilable, constantly rehashed point of contention between her and her ex-husband, anonymised in the diaries as “V”.V, also a writer, insists not only on appropriating the available room in their shared apartment for his office, but on Garner leaving while he works, her presence incompatible with his sacred need for silent isolation. Garner describes the quotidian pain of this situation (she wants to potter, play music, cook, see friends; her creativity is fuelled by these ordinary kinds of life), and the growing realisation of what it said about their relationship with shocking, powerful eloquence. V is aware of, but apparently unmoved by, her distress. They argue about it regularly.Garner’s experience was so egregious as to be eye-poppingly enraging, but this happens more often in quieter, easier-to-overlook ways. I read and enjoyed Consider Yourself Kissed too – it’s a romance, but it also subtly builds a picture of the insidious sidelining of women’s work as expressed through domestic space. Set between 2013 and 2023, it’s particularly good on how this was amplified by Covid: the heroine’s political journalist husband sees his career go stratospheric and their spare room “somehow” becomes his study. He’s a nice man; he loves her; it just … happens.This rang true because it is: it did just happen. Structural pay equalities meant men – habitually the higher earners – staked the more obvious primary claim on working space in locked-down homes. Research shows women experiencedmore non-work interruptions, compounded when they didn’t have a “dedicated unshared workspace” – their emotional wellbeing suffered, but so did their professional lives. “My husband locks the room from the inside when he needs to concentrate,” a participant in anIndian study on pandemic working habitsreported. “I don’t have that liberty. I have no room of my own.”In 1929, Virginia Woolf wrote A Room of One’s Own as a riposte to the physical and economic exclusion of women from intellectual and professional spaces. In 2025, they can’t bar us from libraries, but intimate domestic spaces have proved stubbornly intractable. Back when men had inviolable studies and smoking rooms, there was an assumption that the domestic sphere was feminine, so they “needed” to escape the noise and mess of childrearing and homemaking. Now we’re ostensibly all in it together, doing conference calls in our slippers, but there are still more man caves than women’s. Because Risbridger is right: the recently releasedUK 2024 Skills and Employment surveyfound60% of men had a dedicated room for work at home and only 40% of women. We still can’t manage to meet Woolf’s prescription.There are not-all-men exceptions and happy endings. Garner escaped, thank God, eventually; and, without spoilers, Stanley’s heroine reclaims some space. But in real life, generally, women’s work is still given less and worse space, while the gender pay gap narrows agonisingly slowly. The two are surely related.

Not the chaos of the post-Brexitreferendum years; or the contradiction of his closed-border English nationalism combined with a fondness forcourting nomad capitalistsfrom Malaysia to Mar-a-Lago.This is, of course, because theReform UKleader is the agitator-in-chief. He has prodded successive prime ministers into action, but has not been in the driving seat himself. Things though are changing.When Keir Starmer turned his guns on Reform last week,blasting the party’s “fantasy economics”, he made clear that Farage is now Labour’s most serious rival. WhileKemi Badenochhas led the Conservatives into increasing irrelevance, Reform has marchedon to once traditional Labour groundon the economy, while keeping a rightwing stance on immigration and culture. It is clear that Farage sees an opening to peel support away from both traditional parties at once.It is no fantasy to suggest that Farage, riding high in opinion polls, could become prime minister. He should expect heightened scrutiny of his policies as a result, not least on economic policy, where there are serious questions marks over whether Reform’s tax and spending plans add up.graphic v2However, something is lost in the argument about Farageonomics. Not only are the party’s numbers hardly better than scribblings on the back of one of its leader’s umpteen fag packets, but there is a more fundamental problem: his plans would not help the communities that Reform claims to champion.Yes, scrapping the two-child limit on benefits, introduced by the Conservatives but maintained by Labour –something Farage promised he would do– would be welcome. At least 350,000 children would be lifted out of poverty overnight, at a cost of £2bn – barely a rounding error in the government’s more than £1tn of annual spending.WhyLabourhas not taken this step is a mystery. There is the tight position of public finances, but perhaps also a political calculation that Reform-curious voters are among the majority of people who tell opinion pollsters that benefits eligibility is too lax. As is clear from recent weeks, Britain’s attitudes are not that simple to triangulate. Labour has made a grave political error in reckoning otherwise.Farage’s other policies remain straight from the rightwing, free-market libertarian playbook. They would help working-class families little, and the super-rich a lot.Central to Reform’s election manifesto was a plan to cut £60bn from income tax. It would raise the personal allowance from £12,750 at present to £20,000 a year, while lifting the 40% higher-rate threshold from £50,271 to £70,000. Unspecified welfare cuts worth £15bn also feature – a sum three times larger than the savings Labour is pushing to find from the disability and incapacity support bill, which has provoked nationwide anger.Lifting more people out of tax altogether might sound beneficial for poorer households, and for many it would be. However, most of the gains from these vastly expensive policy changes would flow to the rich.According toanalysisby the IPPR thinktank, raising the personal allowance would come with a cost to the exchequer of at least £40bn a year, and hand the poorest 20% of households an extra £380 on average in annual household disposable income. However, the richest fifth would get a vast £2,400 extra.Changes to the higher-rate threshold would cost the exchequer about £18bn a year, and would benefit the poorest fifth of families by just £17. The richest, again, would get a much bigger boost, of £2,700.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

For those with the biggest gains, look no further than London, home to 47 out of 50 local areas with the highest incomes before housing costs, according to thelatest official figures, including Westminster, Kensington and Chelsea, Wandsworth and Camden.Of the 50 areas with the lowest incomes, more than half are in Yorkshire and the Humber, with a further quarter in the East Midlands, places where Reform has gained the most ground in the opinion polls. Those in Farage’s constituency of Clacton, where average earnings are £25,670 a year, would gain far less than in the leafy London commuter belt seat of Orpington,where the Reform leader has a £1m propertyand typical pay is £41,385 a year.In defence of Farage, something resembling an opposition to Labour’s vast parliamentary majority is not a bad thing. Starmer should not be surprised that the poorest communities in Britain are deserting Labour. Promising “change”, then continuing as the Tories did, with high-profile benefit cuts, will do that.Starmer’s attack on Farage’s fiscally irresponsiblestance may highlight Labour’s discipline but could also backfire. Voters are of course keen for the numbers to add up – nobody would relish another Liz Truss moment – but Labour’s attack is reminiscent of the ill-fated Project Fear, as opponents named the campaign to stay in the EU, and risks reinforcing a sense that the party has lost its purpose in the depths of a Treasury spreadsheet.Where the prime minister should focus is on using words and deeds to show the country’s poorest communities that Labour can change things for the better, in contrast to the cod working-class values of his shape-shifting opponent.Explore more on these topicsEconomic policyViewpoint columnReform UKEconomicsKeir StarmerTax and spendingLabourNorth-south dividecommentShareReuse this content"

His cowardice only makes a war with Taiwan more likelySimon TisdallThe US president’s strange mix of weakness and anti-Beijing hostility may be pushing Xi Jinping towards a fateful decisionSun 1 Jun 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 1 Jun 2025 15.49 EDTShareThe belief that bad things come in threes is an old superstition with scant basis in fact. Still, in these disordered times, it’s natural to wonder whether war in Europe and the Middle East will be followed by war in Asia. Nuclear-armed India and Pakistan, firing off insults and missiles,recently demonstratedhow real that prospect is. Emboldened by its alliance with Russia, North Korea’s unpredictable rogue regime threatens almost everyone.Yet it is China’s accelerating confrontation with US-backed Taiwan that forms the most alarming panel in this gloomy Asian triptych. China’s president, Xi Jinping, has reportedly told his generals to beready by 2027to conquer the self-governing island, which he regards as stolen sovereign territory. US officials warned last week that China already has sufficientcapability to invadenow, with amphibious landing craft, D-day-style floating docks, paratroopers and expanded air combat and missile forces in a constant state of readiness.Recent intimidating offshore military exercises – pessimists call them “rehearsals” – and propaganda and disinformation offensives suggest that politically, too, Beijing is preparing for a fight. It denounces Lai Ching-te, elected Taiwan’s president last year, as a pro-independence “destroyer of peace”. For his part Lai is talking tough, describing China as a “hostile foreign force” and enacting “17 strategies” to curb sabotage and spying. A new Taiwanese TV drama,Zero Day, depicts the frightful impact of an invasion on an unprepared nation.While cross-straitstensions are certainly high, a war between China and Taiwan has often been predicted but has so far been avoided. Since 1979, when the US established diplomatic relations with Beijing and de-recognised Taiwan (while pledging to help it defend itself), peace has held. But calculations change and complacency is dangerous. China is vastly more powerful now than it was 10 or 20 years ago. And for Xi, who turns 72 in June, unification is a legacy project.A range of other factors may be pushing Xi towards a fateful decision, notably Donald Trump’s strange mix of anti-China aggression and personal weakness. The US president could hike his punitive tariffs on China’s exports at any moment, threatening an estimated 9m manufacturing jobs. His hostility towards the US’s biggest rival is evident, seen again last week indiscriminatory curbson technology transfers and Chinese student visas.These crude attempts todamage a Chinese economystruggling with sluggish post-Covid growth and high unemployment are akin to holding a gun to Xi’s head. Does Trump realise how deeply provocative this is? Chinese Communist party control ultimately depends not on elections but on economic success and shared prosperity. Deliberately or not, Trump is assaulting the foundations of the CCP’s power and authority.If pushed too hard, and egged on by hardline nationalist cadres, there’s a risk Xi could call Trump’s bluff with two questions. Does he want a trade war or a real war? Or would he prefer to cut a deal instead – andabandon Taiwan?Were China to obstruct Taiwanese maritime traffic, launch covert cyber-attacks on Taiwan, or impose a full naval and aerial blockade that fell short of all-out invasion, it could force Trump into a humiliating climbdown. It’s no secret Washington opinion is split overdefending Taiwan militarily. Under Trump, the longstanding policy of “strategic ambiguity” has turned into one of chronic pusillanimity.Trump doesn’t want a war in east Asia, and Beijing knows it. It also rightly suspects that, like bullies everywhere, his aggressive bluster conceals a coward’s weakness. He refuses to fight for Ukraine, a core western interest, and kowtows to Russian aggression. He’s terrified Israel will start full-scale wars with Iran and Syria, drawing in the US. His policies are driven by self-interest, money and fear, not principles, treaties or laws.Trump risks driving Europe into China’s embrace. Xi Jinping will be delighted | Orville SchellRead moreSo when people ask if Trump will fight for Taiwan, the answer is not really in serious doubt. In recent months Trump has suggested that Taiwan, like European Nato countries, is exploiting the US security umbrella and not paying enough for its own defence. He has criticised Taipei for supposedly monopolising the semi-conductor market at the expense of US jobs, andimposed tariffs on its exports. None of this inspires confidence in his approach, should a crisis occur.Some American commentators argue that Taiwan is a bear trap, to be avoided at all costs – music to Xi’s ears. Security researchers Jennifer Kavanagh and Stephen Wertheim recentlyargued in Foreign Affairsthat US leaders need a middle path. “Instead of clarifying its commitment to defend Taiwan, Washington should … downplay the importance of keeping the island out of Beijing’s hands,” they wrote. To many, that will sound like surrender.Amid this policy confusion, Taiwan presents a vulnerable target. Lai’s tough line is opposed by many in Taipei, where political schisms are purposely inflamed by Beijing.Defence spending is rising, but not fast enough. Promised US weapons don’t arrive. The island’s notional borders are breached at will by Chinese ships and aircraft. Its armed forces and military doctrines require urgent modernisation. These problems may improve over time – which is another reason why Xi may not wish to wait.Conventional wisdom suggests Beijing prizes geopolitical and economic stability above all else. But what if this comfortable assumption is wrong? Xi surely frames the battle forTaiwanas part of the wider contest between the US and China for regional partners, military superiority and global hegemony. Now a golden opportunity is arising. Thanks to Trump’s chaotic tariffs, domestic firefights, isolationist policies and wanton disruption of European and Asian alliances, the US now looks beatable.InChina, three is considered a lucky number. Hong Kong returned to the fold in 1997, followed by Macau in 1999. Xi wants to complete the hat-trick before he’s done dictating. Watching Trump’s Crazy Gang White House carry on, China’s leader could be forgiven for thinking Taiwan – and its American protectors – are there for the taking.Simon Tisdall is a Guardian foreign affairs commentatorExplore more on these topicsTaiwanOpinionDonald TrumpXi JinpingChinaAsia PacificcommentShareReuse this content"

This is interesting in itself, as parts of it were written around the 4th century BCE, when only the privileged could read and write.Why would the authors of this text, men of privilege, be interested in people who were considered at the time to be “less than normal”?The answer relates, at least in part, to the fact that the text was critical of how its society promoted and prioritised the “valuable” or “useful”, and what was regarded as important to humanity.Within such a society, whatever – orwhoever– falls short of the accepted standards is seen in demeaning ways. But the Zhuangzi rejects this way of thinking.My sister was diagnosed with cancer – and it taught me the meaning of surrender | Making sense of itRead moreSo how might we put some of its persepctives into practice today?Reflect on what we think is ‘valuable’ or ‘useless’The Zhuangzi tells the story of a wondrous tree, so large that its canopy provided shade for thousands of oxen. The tree only became this large because its wood was deemed to be “useless” for any human project. As a result, it was left alone and allowed to grow into its magnificent size.This story shows how easy it is for us to adopt entrenched values. Are we guided too much by what society tells us is “useless”? The story makes us turn the tables on our own assumptions, and challenges our thinking on what “normal” and “useful” means. In this it is reflective of Daoism more broadly, which advocates for diversity in how we think about humanity and human achievements.Be prepared to question what we call ‘normal’Daoismresists what would today be considered an ableist approach to life. It teaches us that looking at life through an ableist lens only leads to negativity about those who are deemed “not good enough”. Such an approach looks for how people are deficient, rather than how they are capable.The Zhuangzi’s point is not that we cannot celebrate excellence. Instead, it champions the richness of life by showing that people can be excellent in many different ways. Its aim is not to tell us how to fix people’s medical and physiological conditions. Rather, prompts us to reflect on the shallow attitudes of those who see others as “disabled”, who want to draw attention to what some people lack, rather than what they might have.Consider what we mean by ‘disability’In a culture obsessed with positive thinking, can letting go be a radical act? | Nadine LevyRead moreThere isn’t a word in the Zhuangzi that means “disability”. Rather, the ancient textuses storytelling and exaggerated language to try to show how society characterises some people in derogatory ways. Stories about “sad horsehead humpback” or “hunchback limpleg” highlight that these are not labels that the men were born with; instead, they were given to these labels by a society that wrongly prides itself on “normalising” able-bodied people.Through these stories, we learn that sometimes the word “disability” is used unfairly to define people, so that our interactions with them are determined by the label.As the Zhuangzi shows, life is too important for us to take a one-size-fits-all approach to it. Its philosophy encourages us to embrace the richness of life by appreciating its diversity.Karyn Lai is a professor of philosophy in the faculty of arts, design and architecture at the University of New South WalesExplore more on these topicsDisabilityMaking sense of itPhilosophyReligioncommentShareReuse this content"

Since then, she’s consistently drawn attention to the tragedy in Palestine bysharingstatistics on the crisis along with images of Palestinian children with her social media audience of tens of millions of followers, and the right has been after her since.The anti-woke warriors used to defend free speech. Now they make McCarthyism look progressive | Arwa MahdawiRead moreBack in March, the New York Post ran anarticleabout Accurso calling her a “Woke brainwasher” and warning parents against the influence they were allowing into their homes.Then, last month, the pro-Israel group StopAntisemitism asked the Department of Justiceto investigatewhether Ms Rachel was operating as a foreign agent because of her posts about children in Gaza. In an open letter to the US attorney general, Pam Bondi, they asked authorities to find out whether Accurso was “being remunerated to disseminate Hamas-aligned propaganda to her millions of followers”.Meanwhile,tens of thousands of childrenhave been killed or injured in Gaza since Israel began its onslaught in retaliation for Hamas’s 7 October 2023 attack – and Israel isn’t letting up, even aschildren face starvation. Last Saturday,Israeli airstrikes killednine of a Gaza doctor’s 10 children while she worked. If speaking up about a genocide makes you a foreign agent, what does that say about the US’s own values?“I care deeply for all children. Palestinian children, Israeli children, children in the US – Muslim, Jewish, Christian children – all children, in every country,” Accursosaidthrough tears on Instagram video from May of 2024. “To do a fundraiser for children who are currently starving, who have no food or water, who are being killed, is human.”For this kind of thing – caring about innocent children – to be controversial is a clear sign of just how far we’ve strayed from our moral core as a society, and a reminder of the inhumanity that pervades this political moment.One of the distinct markers of pro-Israel rhetoric in recent times has been the way it intentionally and violently rejects the idea of children being vulnerable and innocent. Israel’s supporters feel emboldened to castbabiesas collateral damage at best, and “enemies” at their most truly unhinged. And the pro-Israel crowd is angry at Accurso because in a war that does not want us to see them as such, she constantly reminds us that Palestinian children are people, and are deserving of the same kind of care and protection that the west gives its young.Her love for children has also made her an easy target for conservatives who like to label LGBTQ+ people and their allies as creeps and pedophiles looking to groom children. Last year, when Accurso shared a video celebrating Pride month on herInstagramandTikTokaccounts (which are geared toward her adult supporters, of course), rightwing influencers called her “sick” andcomplainedthat she was exposing children to “things they shouldn’t be exposed to”.What it’s like to be in the graduating class of 2025 in Gaza | Nadera MushthaRead moreFor me, Accurso’s speaking out also shines a harsh light on the absolute dearth of outrage from other far more powerful and influential celebrities. This month, more than 300 celebrities and Hollywood figuressignedan open letter condemning the industry’s silence on the genocide. This belated effort falls flat when you consider how people with much less power and way more to lose have risked their livelihoods and safety to speak up for what is right.Overall, though, the hatred for Accurso isn’t just aboutGaza. As a public figure, she is an indictment of everything that rightwingers want us to believe is bad. She’s all about big feelings, standing up for vulnerable people, making people from all walks of life feel included, and celebrating what makes us different. Of course the right hates that.Figures like Accurso are an aberration in a world where bad news generates the most clicks and we are all supposed to be desensitized to the ways vulnerable people continue to have their lives, and the few protections they have left, snatched away from them.Tayo Bero is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warOpinionYouTubeIsraelGazaChildrenSocial mediacommentShareReuse this content"

Look to poor people’s movementsRev Dr Liz Theoharis and Noam Sandweiss-BackAnti-poverty activism has provided a model for transformational power, based on four strategic principlesSun 1 Jun 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 1 Jun 2025 19.41 EDTShareFor tens of millions of people, Donald Trump’s “big, beautiful bill” is a grotesque nightmare. The proposed legislative cuts, includinghistoric attacks on Medicaid and Snap, come at a time when60% of Americansalready cannot make ends meet. As justification, Maga Republicans are once again invoking the shibboleth of work requirements to demean and discredit the poor, even as they funnel billions of dollars into thewar economyand lavish the wealthy withtax cuts.As anti-poverty organizers, we’ve often used the slogan: “They say cut back, we say fight back.” It’s a catchy turn of phrase, but it reveals that for too long we’ve been on the back foot. In the world’s richest country, in which mass poverty exists beside unprecedented plenty, we’re tired of just fending off the worst attacks. Too much ground is lost when our biggest wins are simply not losing past gains. Amid Trump’s cruelty and avarice, it’s time to fight for a new social contract – one that lifts from the bottom of society so that everybody rises.There are no shortcuts to building the kind of popular power necessary for us to shift from defense to offense. The task is a generational one, requiring even greater discipline, sacrifice, perseverance and patience. But as we consider the best way forward, the past offers clues.What the last Trump presidency can teach us about fighting back | Kenneth RothRead moreIn our new book,You Only Get What You’re Organized to Take: Lessons from the Movement to End Poverty, we document insights from some of this country’s most significant poor people’s movements. As nascent fascism continues to metastasize, these largely untold stories contain some of the very solutions we need to prevent democratic decline and overcome bigotry, political violence, Christian nationalism and economic immiseration. Today, the historic demands of the poor – for safety, belonging, peace, equality and justice – are rapidly becoming the demands of humanity. The hard-fought wisdom of the organized poor has much to teach all of us.We’re reminded of the welfare rights movement of the 1960s and 1970s, especially theNational Welfare Rights Organization(NWRO). Largely forgotten to history, NWRO was once the biggest poor people’s organization in the country. The organization, led by poor Black women, regularly staged mass marches and demonstrations and held picket lines and sit-ins at welfare offices, at a time when the poor were subject to racist, exclusionary and moralizing policies. At its height, the organization had more than 100 local chapters, asophisticated operationthat offered a political and spiritual home to more than 20,000 dues-paying members.In 1971 in Nevada, where the governor was cutting the social safety net, the local NWRO chapter organized 1,000 women tostorm Caesars Palace, the luxury hotel and casino, and shut down the main drag in Las Vegas. The protest turned into a multiyear campaign of civil disobedience, and a federal judge eventually reinstated the benefits. These women were unapologetically militant and willing to take big risks. They were also clear that forging power required the less visible spadework of movement-building – including looking after one another through networks of solidarity and collective care.At the same time as the Black Panthers were feeding tens of thousands of children through thefree breakfast program(and provocatively asking why the government couldn’t do the same, even as it spent billions of dollars slaughtering the poor of Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos), NWRO created its own innovative “projects of survival”. The historian Annelise Orleckwrites that in Las Vegas, the “welfare moms applied for and won federal grants to open and run … the first health clinic in the largely Black, and thoroughly poor Westside of Las Vegas. Then came the neighborhood’s first library, public swimming pool, senior citizen housing project, solarization program, crime prevention program, and community newspaper, all organized and staffed by poor mothers and later their young adult children.”As the experience in Las Vegas revealed, the women of NWRO were organizers, caretakers and strategists of the highest order. They were also anti-racists and feminists of an entirely new mold. At a time when many women were fighting for equality within the workplace, NWRO championed “welfare as a right”, challenging the notion that the value of a human is tied to their ability to work within the marketplace and raising fundamental questions about how a society cares for its people. This idea coalesced into their demand for a “guaranteed adequate income”, an early precursor to the expanded child tax credit in 2021. Before this pandemic-era program was abandoned by both reactionary Republicans and recalcitrant Democrats, it lifted 4 million children above the poverty line, thesingle-largest decrease in official child povertyin American history.In alegendary articlefor the 1972 spring issue of Ms Magazine, Johnnie Tillmon, the first chairperson of NWRO and later its executive director, wrote: “For a lot of middle-class women in this country, Women’s Liberation is a matter of concern. For women on welfare, it’s a matter of survival … As far as I’m concerned, the ladies of NWRO are the frontline troops of women’s freedom. Both because we have so few illusions and because our issues are so important to all women – the right to a living wage for women’s work, the right to life itself.”Veterans of the welfare rights movement named their model of grassroots organizing after Tillmon. In “the Johnnie Tillmon model”, poor women, and poor people more broadly, are not simply an oppressed identity group but a latent social force with potentially vast power. Because they have the least invested in the status quo and the most to gain from big change, they are strategically positioned to rise up and rally not just their own communities, but the millions more who are one paycheck, healthcare crisis, job loss, debt collection or eviction away from poverty.In order to harness this transformational power, the Johnnie Tillmon model proposes four strategic principles, as relevant today as they were in the 1960s and 1970s:The poor must unite across their differences and assume strong leadership within grassroots movements.These movements must operate as a politically and financially independent force in our public life.The leaders of these movements must attend to the daily needs and aspirations of their communities by building visionary projects of survival.These projects of survival must serve as bases of operation for broader organizing, political education and leadership development.The women of NWRO believed there was unrecognized ingenuity and untapped brilliance within their communities. Even before the organization existed, the tens of thousands of women who made up its membership were already leaders in countless ways: they knew how to pool their meager resources, feed one another, navigate treacherous government bureaucracy and protect themselves from brutal state-sanctioned violence. When such survival skills were collectivized, networked and politicized, these women became a force to be reckoned with.The same could be true today. As theTrump administrationintensifies its attacks on life-saving programs like Medicaid and Snap, poor and dispossessed people will not passively swallow their suffering. Already, in states as far-flung as Vermont and Alaska, Michigan and North Carolina, we’re seeing an upsurge of resistance among Medicaid recipients. But we cannot be satisfied simply with righteous acts of protest and mass mobilization. The question is how to transform our growing indignation into lasting and visionary power.

The manager had certainly cut a cool and confident figure when he emerged on to the pitch about 90 minutes before kick-off for a quick temperature check with his coaches.The PSG ultras were already behind one of the goals, bobbing up and down en masse. They would be a forceful presence throughout.Luis Enriquewas aware that an omen was on his side. Every time Munich had hosted a final in Europe’s elite competition, a new champion had emerged. Nottingham Forest, 1979. Marseille, 1993. Borussia Dortmund, 1997. And Chelsea, 2012. Inter had arrived as three-time winners.PSG 2.0 have potential to dominate but young stars could be lured away | Nick AmesRead moreLuis Enrique is a spiritual person, so maybe that fed into things. What absolutely didwas the shining lighthe had in the sky. “You will be the star that guides our family,” he wrote in tribute to his daughter Xana in 2019 after she died from bone cancer at the age of nine. Luis Enrique carries more than the unimaginable pain. He feels enriched by the time he was able to spend with her.When the game got under way, everything quickly felt just right for PSG. Luis Enrique had declared his side knew “how to unpick teams like Inter, how to get that tight-knit defence to unravel”. He believed in his approach, how his players would pass and move, especially the bit about the movement – the positional fluidity, the unusual overloads, the aggression in the press, as well. A 2-0 lead after 20 minutes was fortifying.The way Luis Enrique would tell it, even at 3-0 midway through the second half he wanted a fourth because the game “could still open up” for Inter. So Khvicha Kvaratskhelia’s goal for 4-0 on 73 minutes was probablythemoment for the Spanish coach, although he seemed to really let it all out when Senny Mayulu made it five just before the end.The 19-year-old substitute, who had been on for only two minutes, was giddy with joy; disbelief even. For Luis Enrique, it was an example of his Midas touch on the night but also a symbol of something wider in terms of what he has built. An unheralded youngster ought not to be able to do this in club football’s biggest game. It is gloriously possible within Luis Enrique’s collective.View image in fullscreenSenny Mayulu had been on for only two minutes when he scored PSG’s fifth goal in the final.Photograph: Michael Zemanek/ShutterstockSomething felt crystal clear as the PSG captain, Marquinhos, emerged through the golden confetti – detonated a little early – to hoist the trophy; Luis Enrique must now be considered among the all-time greats of his profession.For him, the glory of Munich added up to a second “classic” treble of his career – league,Champions League, principle domestic cup – having achieved the feat at Barcelona in 2014-15. Only one other manager has done this: his former Barcelona and Spain teammate Pep Guardiola, who pulled it off with Barcelona in 2008‑09 and Manchester City in 2022-23.

You know, he inherited Lionel Messi and Neymar, with Luis Suárez added for him. Sergio Busquets, Andrés Iniesta and Xavi were already there, too.It has been different at PSG. With the help of Luís Campos, the recruitment chief, Luis Enrique has created a team – and one in the truest sense. Willian Pacho, João Neves and Désiré Doué were brought in last summer, with Kvaratskhelia, thefinal piece of the puzzle, joining in January.PSG have spent heavily; it was £200m on that quartet alone. Everything continues to stem from the wealth of the club’s Qatari owners. Yet Luis Enrique has proved his genius by assembling a largely unstarry group who play for the badge rather than themselves; a break, frankly, from previous PSG vintages. And one that is capable of hitting such beautifully sweet high notes, which has a defined and likable identity.View image in fullscreenPSG fans display a banner showing the manager, Luis Enrique, and his late daughter, Xana.Photograph: Christina Pahnke/sampics/Corbis/Getty ImagesOusmane Dembélé, who signed in the summer of 2023, which was when Luis Enrique arrived, has scored 33 goals this season. He did not add to the tally against Inter, although he did contribute two assists and was his usual threat. But it was his work without the ball, especially the energy with which he led the press, that had Luis Enrique purring.“Everyone is talking about the Ballon d’Or … I would give it to Dembélé just for his defensive work against Inter,” the manager said. “He showed what he was made of. He was a leader, he was humble.”Luis Enrique had noted a few weeks back: “The first year at a club is generally not perfect but in the second you grow more in terms of football and confidence.” He called it, he has felt it, the click coming in January when PSG stormed back from 2-0 downto win 4-2 against Guardiola’s Cityat the Parc des Princes in the penultimate Champions League group phase game.Since then, they have ridden the wave past everybody, including Liverpool, Aston Villa and Arsenal, all the way to the crowning moment against Inter. And when it was over, there was the tifo from the PSG ultras. It depicted Luis Enrique and Xana in PSG colours planting a flag in the turf, just as they had done with Barcelona after the 2015 Champions League final victory against Juventus. It was overwhelmingly emotional. Xana can be very proud of her dad.Explore more on these topicsLuis EnriqueParis Saint-GermainChampions LeaguefeaturesShareReuse this content"

I’m just incredibly proud of the whole team over the three weeks. It’s a sweet success.“I’ve spent a lot of my life targeting this race. There’s been a lot of setbacks, and it has been hard to deal with. I’m in disbelief that I have finally managed to pull it off.”Britain’s Simon Yates seals Giro d’Italia in Rome for second Grand Tour titleRead moreYates, who had been on the verge of winning the 2018 Giro when he endured a dramatic collapse in the pivotal mountain stage, is the third British rider, after Chris Froome and Tao Geoghegan Hart, to win the Italian race.The Lancastrian arrived in Rome wearing all-pink kit with matching pink bike, in honour of the Giro’smaglia rosa, and was shepherded safely through the final processional sprint stage to secure final victory.Ahead of him his Visma-Lease a Bike teammate Olav Kooij took the final stage in a sprint, as a beaming Yates celebrated in his wake. “We couldn’t wish for a better final weekend,” Kooij said. “Yesterday was really amazing for the team and today I had to give everything that was left in the legs.”Yates’s Giro-winning attack on the crucial climb of the Finestre, the mountain that had dramatically proved his undoing in 2018, stunned onlookers and exploded the overall standings.On social media Geraint Thomas said: “What is going on?!”, as he watched Saturday’s drama between the three key protagonists – Yates, Isaac Del Toro and Richard Carapaz – unfold.View image in fullscreenSimon Yates during the final stage in Rome.Photograph: Luca Bettini/AFP/Getty ImagesReminded that Yates had far more experience of Grand Tour racing than the 21‑year‑old Del Toro, Thomas, winner of the 2018 Tour de France, was scathing. “Do you need experience to realise that third place is pulling away and that, if you stop pedalling, he’s going to take time out of you? My son Macs would know that, and he’s five years old.”Even Yates seemed overwhelmed by the scale of his achievement on the mountain that had once proven his downfall. “I always had in the back of my mind that maybe I could come here and close the chapter. Maybe not to take the jersey in the race, but at least the stage, to try to show myself the way I know I can do.”He admitted, though, that he “really did not believe” such a dream scenario was possible. “I am not really an emotional person, but coming to the finish I couldn’t hold back the tears.”Del Toro, who had appeared like Yates in 2018 destined to win the race, hid his disappointment. “Yates was the most intelligent,” the Mexican said. “It was good for his team and how they played the tactics.”But Carapaz, Giro champion in 2019, rounded on the Mexican. “In the end, Del Toro lost the Giro,” the Ecuadorian said. “He didn’t know how to race and in the end the smartest [rider] won.”Juan Manuel Gárate, Carapaz’s EF Education EasyPost sports director, sought to justify the lack of any serious pursuit of Yates. “There came a moment where you had to decide: ‘If Yates goes, let him go. If Del Toro doesn’t follow, he loses the GC.’ To win, you have to play the game.

We are putting our lives on the line. We are fortunate the cars are as safe as they are these days but we shouldn’t take it for granted.“It felt very deliberate. It is something I have seen numerous times in sim racing and go-karts. I have never seen it in aFormula Onerace. It felt strange, bizarre and I really don’t know what was going through his mind.”Verstappen was told by his team to give a place back to Russell in the latter stages of the race. The pair had struck one another at turn one and the Dutchman had gone off but maintained his position in front of Russell.

EnterJoe Root, and an innings for the ages.Root produced a display of ethereal stroke-making on his way to a stunning, unbeaten 166, a batting performance of such beauty that the ugliness of much that came before will be forgotten. It was his highest score in one-day internationals, propelling him past Eoin Morgan to become England’s leading run-scorer in this format, and the first Englishman to score more than 7,000. It ended with a straight drive that brought his 23rd boundary, victory by three wickets, and a series secured with a game to spare. Typically, the match-winner sought afterwards to deflect credit rather than to bask in it.England edge West Indies to win second ODI as Root scores 166 not out – as it happenedRead more“The way we managed to wrestle it back to [a target of] 309, I thought it was exceptional work from the bowlers,” he said. “There have been a lot of England teams I’ve played in before where we’ve ended up with 350 and then it’s a completely different chase.”There was praise also for Harry Brook’s captaincy: “He led the team really well, that’s a really good sign for us moving forward. He might not always be the most intelligent away from cricket, but he understands the game exceptionally well,” and for Will Jacks, who scored 49 in an unfamiliar role at No 7, mostly in singles as he sought to give Root the strike: “To show that maturity, the skill, the calmness, and the clarity was really impressive.”After Keacy Carty’s century, Shai Hope’s 66-ball 78 and a brilliant start to their efforts in the field West Indies will be asking themselves where, across a blustery day at Sophia ­Gardens, they were blown off course.Their minds will snag on the final delivery of the sixth over of ­England’s innings, when Matthew Forde wheeled away in celebration, with arms outstretched and nary a backward glance, after thudding the ball into Root’s back pad. He had reached the slip cordon by the time he turned back to see an immobile umpire, and the inevitable review showed the ball would have clipped the bails but not with sufficient force for the on-field decision to be reversed. Root had scored seven.View image in fullscreenJoe Root turns the ball behind during his unbeaten 166 off 139 balls.Photograph: Paul Ellis/AFP/Getty ImagesThe next delivery, the first of a fresh over, kissed Brook’s bat and was put down by Hope behind the stumps. “We know what the game could have been if things had gone our way,” Carty said. If they had, ­England would at that point have been 41 for four.Even in victory England will know that, after a whipcrack-smart performance in the opener on ­Thursday, this was a very different story. Their ­fielding display was peppered with misfields, fluffed run-outs and dropped catches, and for a while they carried that form into their ­batting. Their target might have looked eminently achievable as Ben Duckett and Jamie Smith strode out but it had taken on a quite different appearance by the time both openers strode in again, neither of them having scored.Duckett’s dismissal, flaying a wide delivery from Forde to Jayden Seales at wide third man, completed what was for him a particularly miserable outing, given that he was also responsible for two of those drops and the worst of the missed run-outs.Root and Brook added 85 for the third wicket before the England captain, having motored to 47 off 36, misjudged a hook off Joseph and set up another Seales catch.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

From 258 for four they added just 50 more runs as the lower order crumbled; England meanwhile were 93 for four before they turned things around.“For us to have another win in a slightly new environment will fill the guys in the group with confidence,” Root said. “Hopefully this can be a team that is consistent and sticks together for a long period of time, and we can start building something together.”Explore more on these topicsCricketEngland cricket teamWest Indies cricket teamJoe Rootmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

She had simply not shown up. As Elena Rybakina bulldozed through the early stages of their highly anticipated fourth-round tussle, Swiatek trailed 6-1, 2-0 and her hopes of victory were fading.For much of this year, Swiatek has struggled to find her form when forced into difficult positions against her toughest rivals. However, she showed her resilience here with a supreme 1-6, 6-3, 7-5 statement win against the 12th seed, to return to the quarter-finals of theFrench Open.French Open: Swiatek and Sabalenka advance, Paolini out – as it happenedRead moreFive years since her first French Open title, Swiatek’s era of dominance at Roland Garros now stands at 25 consecutive victories, the longest winning run here among female players in the 21st century. This win could have a transformative effect on the Pole’s confidence as she tries to shake off her difficult run of form and recover self‑belief, in her attempt to become the first woman in history to win the French Open singles title four times in a row.“I think I needed that kind of win to feel these feelings that I’m able to win under pressure, and even if it’s not going the right way, still turn the match around to win it,” Swiatek said. “For sure it’s a great confirmation for me. I for sure wanted to have a match like that. Obviously it’s great to also have full control over the match, but against great players it’s not always going to be possible. I’m happy that I fought, and I also problem-solved on court.”Although she avoided a fourth‑round meeting with her nemesis Jelena Ostapenko, who holds a 6-0 record against the five‑time grand slam title winner, Swiatek still found herself up against one of her toughest rivals. Rybakina’s own recent struggles are reflected in her seeding of No 12. At her best, however, the 2022 Wimbledon champion is one of the top four players in the world.With her precise, destructive serve and the effortless power she generates with her groundstrokes, Rybakina’s game also matches up extremely well against Swiatek’s. The Kazakhstani played flawless attacking tennis for 45 minutes as she established a set and break lead: “In the first set it felt like I was playing Jannik Sinner,” Swiatek said.View image in fullscreenElena Rybakina played a flawless first set.Photograph: Denis Balibouse/ReutersDespite her high-profile difficulties this year, Swiatek has still been more consistent than the vast majority of the tour this year. Her problems have arisen usually against the best players. When she has been pushed by quality players, she has often become overwhelmed by her own doubts. This time, she continued to think clearly under pressure.From 6-1, 2-0 down, Swiatek gradually worked her way back into the match, particularly using her heavy topspin forehand to force Rybakina back and drag her out wide on her forehand side. Swiatek also opted to take a deeper return position, a significant departure on her usual position close to the baseline, which allowed her more time to return Rybakina’s imperious serve. After working through numerous tight games early on, Swiatek established greater momentum and forced a third set.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Swiatek saved three break points at 2-3 then, after finally breaking serve to lead 4-3, she handed the momentum back with another double fault. No matter, in the most consequential match of the tournament so far, which would have been a worthy final, Swiatek played positive attacking tennis under immense pressure until the end. Instead of allowing the tension to overwhelm her, she searched for solutions until she found them.Swiatek will next face the 13th seed, Elina Svitolina, who produced a brilliant comeback victory herself on a spectacular day in the women’s draw. Despite facing three match points, Svitolina recovered to defeat Jasmine Paolini – the fourth seed, and runner‑up last year – to reach her fifth quarter‑final in Paris.

One of those, the ISPS Handa World Invitational in Northern Ireland, was co-sanctioned by the LPGA and earned her a tour card in 2022. Before Sunday, the highlight of Stark’s minimal major resume was placing second to Kordaat the 2024 Chevron Championship. Korda came up short of a would-be third major victory. She earned her best finish at a US Women’s Open and her third top-10.Julia Lopez Ramirez of Spain played in the final pairing with Stark after shooting a 68 on Saturday.

For the manager, Kevin Maher, the result left him “raw” but the performance “tells you everything about the standard of the league”.Both men used their post-match remarks to press for a third promotion spot to League Two and the entertainment on offer and, more important, the size and volume of the Wembley crowd suggested they had a point. An attendance of 52,115 was the highest in history for the National League playoff, and this despite constraints on ticketing forced by disruption to transport into Wembley.Mellon said the National League was full of teams that would “make League Two better”, and his words were borne out in a match where the fitness and technical levels were impressive and the ­contrasting approaches made for a more ­interesting contest than you regularly find at the top end of the pyramid.View image in fullscreenOldham players celebrate with the trophy after their National League playoff victory.Photograph: Adam Davy/PAA clash in styles was visi­ble from the off. Oldham had already lofted a few set plays into the Southend box, some from their own half, before the Shrimpers took an early lead, the unfortunate Manny Monthé beating his own keeper with a touch of the tip of his toe as he tried to chase down a through ball from Southend’s 17‑goal right-back Gus Scott-Morriss.The Latics should have ­equalised through the teenager Vimal Yoganathan in the 17th minute, but he placed a header wide at the far post. Joe Garner had an effort cleared off the line on the half-hour and a minute before half‑time Mike Fondop chased down two Southend clearances and burst through on goal but lifted the ball wide with only the goalkeeper Nick Hayes to beat.The momentum was all with ­Oldham and their intense press unsettled Southend again just a minute after the restart. A corner was aimed at Monthé and he was hauled to the ground by Ben Goodliffe. The referee, Elliot Bell, pointed to the spot and Garner, the former Ipswich and Nottingham Forest forward, stepped up coolly, sending Hayes the wrong way.The game then slid back into equilibrium, with Southend producing decent patterns and Oldham perhaps struggling to maintain their earlier intensity. The best openings of the half only came in added time and both fell for Oldham; first a low drive from Mark Kitching that went just past the post; then an air kick from James Norwood, on as a substitute, when any connection would surely have sealed the match.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Cunha, who has won 13 caps, scored 17 goals in all competitions for Wolves this past season.Ruben Amorim is eager to make changes to United’s squad. It is expected that it will be a busy summer of change at Old Trafford and Cunha is a key target as a No 10 who could fit into Amorim’s 3-4-3 system. The Brazilian is used to playing in a similar formation at Molineux under Vítor Pereira and has excelled, despite Wolves flirting with the prospect of relegation.United endured their worst season in 51 years, finishing 15th, one place above Wolves. A summer transfer budget of £100m has been made available to Amorim, although this could be increased by sales.

He won the club’s player of the year award and waved farewell to the Wolves faithful at the end of their final game of the season against Brentford. “I’ve made it clear that I need to take the next step,” Cunha told the Guardian in March. “I want to fight for titles, for big things.

Though the ugly heart of the Trump administration has hardly been hidden, there is an especially grotesque contrast between its vaunted family values and its treatment of the young.On the campaign trail, Donald Trumpdeclared: “I want a baby boom.” JD Vance, his vice-president, says he wants “more happy children in our country”. Magapro-natalistsare pushingincentivesfor families to have more children.Yet Bruce Lesley, president of the advocacy organisation First Focus on Children, says that we may never have seen an administration “so laser-focused on targeting the nation’s children for harm”. Its dismantling of the Department of Education ison holdthanks to a judge. But it has already slashed staff at agenciesoverseeing key servicessuch as child protection and the enforcement of child support payments. Mr Trump’s “big, beautiful” budget sacrifices the interests of babies for those of billionaires, slashing foundational programmes that provide healthcare and food tomore than two-fifths of American children.One detail is telling: it would also deny the child tax credit to families with mixed immigration status. Mr Trump’s vision of the nation is the antithesis of Mr Mandela’s inclusivity. Unaccompanied migrant children as young as four arefacing immigration hearingswithout lawyers. That’s unlikely to concern him: as many as 1,360 children separated from their parents at the border in his first termhave never been reunitedwith them.An estimated 5.6 million US-citizen children live with at least one undocumented parent. Almost 4% are at risk of beingleft with no parent in their homein the event of mass deportation. Mr Trump’s attempt toend birthright citizenshipmakes explicit the belief that these children are not truly American either. They are what the historian Prof Mae Ngaihas called “alien citizens”, whose standing is deemed suspect – if not denied – due to their race. Young US citizens have beendeported alongside parentswho say they were given no option to leave their children, one of whom had late-stage cancer. In another case, a two-year-old was sent to foster care when her parents were deported: this time, her mother was reportedlygiven no option to take her.The immigration crackdown will further encourage employersshort of workersto turn to children – often those born to migrants – for badly paid, dirty and dangerous jobs. “Why do we say we need to import foreigners, even import them illegally, when teenagers used to work at these resorts?”askedFlorida’s governor, Ron deSantis. Child labour laws are already too frequently ignored, yet Republicans haveloosened them furtherin 16 states in the last few years, and sought to do so in many more.Florida’s House of Representatives recently approved legislation allowing children as young as 14to work overnight without breaks. Yet the state Senate chose not to move the bill – and overall more statesstrengthened than dilutedlabour protections last year. For now at least, the administrationappears to have reversed courseon eliminating the Head Start early education programme. Mr Trump and his allies are exposing their grim vision of a nation in which only some children deserve to be treated with care and basic respect. Others must continue to fight to protect the most vulnerable.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

This won’t be the first time that ministers will have stressed the importance of healthy lifestyles. But nine months after Wes Streeting announced that a shift from treatment to prevention would be one of the principles governingLabour’s stewardship of the NHS, we are just a few weeks away from knowing how the idea will be put into practice, and turned into a narrative for voters.In recent years,obesityhas dominated discussions of the rising burden of chronic illness. But alcohol, too, is expected to feature in sections of the plan dealing with public health. Alcohol-related deaths in the UK reached arecord high of 10,473in 2023, with men more than twice as likely to die as women, and over-55s drinking far more than younger adults. The highest death rates are in Scotland and Northern Ireland.In hisreviewof the crisis facing the NHS, Lord Darzi highlighted that the rise in deaths in England coincided with alcohol’s increasing affordability. By contrast, in Scotland, research suggests – though it does not definitively prove – that the introduction of minimum unit pricing has led tofewer deaths and hospitalisations.Pressure for a tougher approach from policymakers to alcohol is also growing internationally. Two years ago the World Health Organization (WHO) made a public statement that there isno safe amount of alcohol. Last month, in Amsterdam, a newEuropean Health Alliance on Alcoholwas launched. It plans to campaign for the reduction of alcohol-related injuries and illnesses. Later this year, a UN general assembly meeting on non-communicable diseases is expected to include discussion of alcohol-related illness.If governments decide to act in response to such pressure, the options open to them include minimum pricing, taxes, advertising restrictions and stricter guidelines (in the UK, adults are recommended not to exceed 14 units a week, while pregnant women are advised not to drink at all). Other public health interventions include specialist clinics and other local services for those who are already addicted or ill.Before last year’s election, Labour ruled out minimum unit pricing in England, although this was introduced by aLabour administration in Wales. If this decision has not already been reviewed in connection with the 10-year health plan, then it should be.But lobbyists will ensure that this and other challenges to the industry won’t be easy. Last month, the Guardian reported on how new restrictions on ultra-processed foods werewatered downunder pressure from the Food and Drink Federation. While the guidance to retailers was softened under the last government, these changes have not been reversed by Labour. Unsurprisingly, a government that has staked its reputation on economic growth is a good listener to businesses.Rules and regulations are not the only factor shaping habits and behaviour. The drinks industry is also pushing back withadvertising campaignsthat reach over politicians’ heads and seek to influence the public directly. Central to these efforts is a message that moderate drinking is not harmful. While this is in direct contradiction to the WHO’s stance, it may appeal to a public that enjoys drinking. Ministers must ensure that accurate information about risks is out there, too, and that government decisions are guided by health, not lobbying.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The cordon will remain in place overnight. A white Irish adult male is deceased at the scene.“The army explosive ordnance disposal (EOD) team has been requested to attend.”Ireland’s deputy leader, Simon Harris, said he was “deeply concerned”, adding: “I understand a young child has been hurt and I join with people across our country in thinking of them and their family tonight.“I am also thinking of all those who witnessed this situation and the awful shock and upset it must have caused them. I know their families and communities will rally to support them. I am grateful to our emergency services for their work and response.”O’Callaghan said: “This was a really shocking incident. My thoughts are with everyone affected by the shooting and the community and families impacted, including those working at the scene.“This is something we never want or expect to happen in our communities. Gun violence is very rare in Ireland, and I am determined that will remain the case. The area in Carlow is safe. “We must now allow An Garda Síochána to investigate this incident fully.”A local Fine Gael councillor, Fergal Browne, said: “People were obviously terrified, a bank holiday Sunday, going into town to do their shopping. People ran from the centre crying and upset.“There was a bunch of foreign students in the area, who could not believe they were caught up in the middle of all of it.“It’s a busy spot. We launched a photographic exhibition there on Friday night in the shopping centre.”Browne added: “There is lots of activity in the centre between people shopping and people working there, exhibitions. It’s very upsetting for everyone who was involved in it or who witnessed it. I was down there in the last hour and it seems to have calmed down a good bit now.”Browne said he wanted to thank all the emergency services that had attended the scene.Explore more on these topicsIrelandEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

WhileMoroccocontrols most of the territory, the Algerian-backed Polisario Front controls land in the east of the territory and wants full independence from Rabat.Under Morocco’s autonomy plan, Western Sahara would remain under Rabat’s sovereignty but with a degree of self-rule.The US recognised Morocco’s claim over Western Sahara in 2020 during Trump’s first administration. France followed suit last year, along with Spain in 2021.“The UK will continue to act bilaterally, including economically, regionally and internationally in line with this position to support the resolution of the conflict,” Lammy said after talks with his Moroccan counterpart, Nasser Bourita.The region has been contested since 1975, when Spain withdrew from its former colony, sparking a conflict between Morocco and the pro-independence Polisario Front.A UN-brokered ceasefire was reached in 1991, with promises of a referendum on the territory’s future that has never materialised.Talks have since stalled, and in 2020 the Polisario declared the truce over, accusing Morocco of violating its terms.Algeria, a key regional player, has previously criticised Rabat’s plan and US support for the proposals.Bourita described the UK’s endorsement as part of “a momentum to speed up the solution of the conflict”. He said British investments in Western Sahara were under discussion. The two countries also signed cooperation deals on healthcare, innovation, ports, water infrastructure and procurement.Lammy said the partnerships would allow “British businesses to score big on football’s biggest stage”, a reference to Morocco’s preparations to co-host the 2030 World Cup alongside Spain and Portugal.The UN still officially supports a negotiated solution that would allow the people of Western Sahara to decide whether to become independent or remain part of Morocco.Explore more on these topicsWestern SaharaMoroccoForeign policyDavid LammyAfricaMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

It is based on an assessment of broad weather patterns across the whole of the UK and factors in recent global weather trends.Nicola Maxey, a spokesperson for the Met Office, said: “It’s not produced as a public forecast for people to look at and work out whether we can have a barbecue in August or a garden party in July.“At this time of year, global signals influencingUK weatherare typically weak,” she added. “However, consistent with our warming climate and as we have seen over recent years, the current outlook indicates an increased likelihood of above-average temperatures this summer. This is not a guarantee of prolonged hot weather or heatwaves; while we could see more hot days and warm nights than usual, we could also see a mix of cooler days and less extreme warmth.”The outlook shows it is 2.3 times more likely than normal that the UK will be hot over meteorological summer, which begins on 1 June and ends on 31 August. The average temperatures across the UK over those months range from 10-17C, with the south-east ofEnglandexperiencing the higher averages of 16-17C.This would be in line with a recent trend of unusually hot summers. The last time the UK experienced a “cool” summer was in 2015.The ongoingextreme marine heatwavein north-west European waters – sea surface temperatures around UK coastlines are 1.5-2.5C warmer than average – may further boost temperatures, although the added warmth and moisture in the air could potentially lead to more intense summer storms.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Many water companies will be hoping for a wet summer to help avoid the need for water usage restrictions. This week, theEnvironment Agency declared drought statusfor the north-west of England following the driest start to spring in 69 years, with many reservoirs in the region at historical low levels for the time of year.Summers in the UK have become warmer, wetter and sunnier in recent decades due to climate change, according to the Met Office’sState of the UK Climate report.Observations show that extremes of temperature in the UK have been affected much more than average temperature. The number of “hot” days (28C) more than doubled and “very hot” days (30C) more than tripled for 2014-23 compared with 1961-90. Extreme weather events such as the 2022 heatwave, when temperatures in England surpassed 40C for the first time, were made more likely by climate change and are expected to become more common in future.Explore more on these topicsUK weatherEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

The 16-year-old athlete, AB Hernandez, tied for first place alongside two other athletes in the high jump, and tied for first place in the triple jump.This comes as theTrump administrationthreatened to withhold federal funding from California for allowing trans athletes to compete in girls’ sports.The meet took place days after the California Interscholastic Federation, the governing body for high school sports in the state,changed its rules. Now, if a transgender athlete places in a girls’ event, the athlete who finishes just behind will also receive the same place and medal.Despite protests at the meet, the athletes expressed joy during the meet, multiple outlets reported.“Sharing the podium was nothing but an honor,” another high school athlete said to theSan Francisco Chronicle. “Although the publicity she’s been receiving has been pretty negative, I believe she deserves publicity because she’s a superstar. She’s a rock star. She’s representing who she is.”View image in fullscreenAB Hernandez (center) flashes a sign as she shares the first-place spot on the podium with Jillene Wetteland (left) and Lelani Laruelle during a medal ceremony for the high jump at the California high school track-and-field championships in Clovis, California, on 31 May 2025.

The two co-winners also cleared that height after each logged a failed attempt. The three shared the first-place win, smiling as they stepped together onto the podium.Hernandez received first place in the triple jump, sharing the top spot with an athlete who trailed by just more than a half-meter, the AP said. Earlier in the afternoon, Hernandez placed second in the long jump.Scared advertisers, flag bans and Trump: the US is in for a troubled Pride 2025Read moreHernandez and her participation in the meet brought national attention and attacks by theTrump administration. She has become the target of a national, rightwing campaign to ban trans athletes from youth sports. The justice department said it would investigate the California Interscholastic Federation and the school district to determine whether they violated federal sex-discrimination law.The federation’s rule change reflects efforts to find a middle ground in the debate over trans girls’ participation in high school sports. They announced the change after Trump threatened to pull federal funding fromCaliforniaunless it bars trans athletes from competing on girls’ teams. But the federation said it decided on the change before the Trump threats.Hernandez’s participation in the sport is allowed by a 2013 state law, stating that students can compete in the category reflecting their gender identity.At least 24 states have laws on the books barring transgender women and girls from participating in certain women’s or girls’ sports competitions, theAP reported.Explore more on these topicsTransgenderTrump administrationCaliforniaWest CoastUS politicsLGBTQ+ rightsnewsShareReuse this content"

It has also fuelled a renewed interest in the global nuclear power renaissance already under way.Despite long-held environmental concerns about nuclear power generation, political leaders across the globe are increasingly looking to lift restrictions on nuclear reactors or invest billions in new projects to keep pace with the fast-rising demand for low-carbon energy, which is expected to accelerateas AI datacentres grow.InSpain, the blackout has intensified an ongoing debate over the government’s plans to phase out the country’s remaining seven nuclear reactors by 2035. Support for the low-carbon energy source has re-emerged hand-in-hand with criticism of renewable energy, and its potential role in the outage.Spain’s power grid relied on renewable energy for about 70% of its power at the time of the blackout, which experts believe may have made it more difficult for the energy system operator to keep the grid’s frequency stable.View image in fullscreenFans at the Madrid Open tennis tournament last month after matches were suspended because of the power outage.Photograph: Violeta Santos Moura/ReutersThe suggestion was vehemently denied by Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, in the country’s parliament. Just hours after the blackout he said: “There was no problem caused by an excess of renewable energy. Those who link this incident to the lack of nuclear energy are either lying or revealing their ignorance.”But even before the Iberian peninsula was plunged into chaos, critics of the government’s anti-nuclear stance had raised their concerns. A few weeks before the blackout, the chair of the renewable energy company Iberdrola, which owns a small stake in the country’s nuclear fleet, warned Spain against plans to shut all seven of its nuclear power plants by 2035.Ignacio Galán predicted that Spain could see its electricity prices jump by a quarter and get a less reliable system if Madrid followed the example of Germany, which began to close its nuclear reactors following the Fukushima nuclear disaster in 2011 andcompleted the phase-out in 2023.Days later Sama Bilbao y León, director-general of the World Nuclear Association, told a conference in Madrid that she was “concerned about Spain’s economic future without nuclear energy” because its economic progress would rely on “abundant, clean, and affordable energy, available every day, all year round”.In Germany the hardline stance against nuclear power is already softening. Chancellor Friedrich Merz, who came to power in February, has criticised the previous government for shutting Germany’s last three nuclear power stations in the midst of Europe’s energy cost crisis and promised to explore whether it is possible to resurrect the plants.Merz is not expected to back a return to new conventional nuclear power projects in Germany but he has vowed to invest in new technologies: such as small modular reactors (SMRs) and nuclear fusion. The Swiss government has also said it will lift the country’s ban on the construction of new nuclear power projects, which has been in place since 1 January 2018, to pursue SMR projects.The tide against nuclear power is turning in countries beyond Europe too.Later this summer Taiwan is expected to vote on whether to restart a nuclear reactor which shut just last week amid concerns on the island about the rising electricity demand of some of the world’s biggest chipmakers which are based there, and about energy security in the event of a military blockade by China.The concerns about a looming surge in power demand driven by tech giants and the desire for secure, homegrown low-carbon energy sources are common in countries across the globe. This trend is key to the renewed interest in nuclear power.In the US, the notorious Three Mile Island site in Pennsylvaniawill restart for the first time in five yearsafter its owners struck a 20-year deal to power Microsoft’s energy-hungry AI datacentres.

The move was welcomed by nuclear proponents as a step towards helping to lower emissions in the US while supporting Big Tech.“Several big tech companies looking for low carbon, round-the-clock energy signed contracts for new nuclear capacity in the last year, and there could be more such deals ahead,” predicted the US investment bank Goldman Sachs earlier this year.“The proliferation of AI data centers has boosted investor confidence in future growth in electricity demand at the same time as big tech companies are looking for low-carbon reliable energy. This is leading to the de-mothballing of recently retired nuclear generators, as well as consideration for new larger-scale reactors,” it added.View image in fullscreenThe Three Mile Island nuclear site in 2011.Photograph: Bradley C Bower/APThe growing demand for electricity may have piqued the interest of global government in nuclear power, but it is the breakthrough in new nuclear technologies which promises a new dawn for the industry. Whereas full-scale nuclear projects are notorious for spiralling budgets and delays, SMRs promise quicker, cheaper construction because the component parts can be built in a factory and assembled on site. But the technology has not been proven commercially.Last year Google became the first company to ink an agreement to purchase nuclear energy from small modular reactors (SMRs), which are being developed by Kairos Power in the US. Small modular reactors are also being pursued by the US, South Korea, China, Russia, and Canada. The latter approved the construction of the first mini-nuclear reactor in the West earlier this month which is expected to begin operating by 2029.In the UK, Keir Starmer unveiled plans for a historic expansion in nuclear power across England and Wales shortly after calling for tech companies to work alongside the government to build small modular reactors (SMRs) to power energy intensive AI datacentres across Britain. He said that he anticipated smaller reactors could begin operating in 2032 and become commonplace across Britain.The nuclear industry’s detractors have played down the potential for SMRs to prove a gamechanger for nuclear energy. Dr Doug Parr, the chief scientist and a director at Greenpeace UK, said the Labour government had “swallowed nuclear industry spin whole, which is courageous – or stupid – given that not a single one has been built, and with the nuclear industry’s record of being over time and over budget unmatched by any other sector.”He added: “As for the unsolved problem of nuclear waste management, government don’t see the need to mention it at all.”Nuclear powerhas seen false dawns before, but the industry believes the next decade could hold the key to its renaissance.Explore more on these topicsNuclear powerEnergyNuclear wasteSpainEuropeRenewable energyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But dark-roofing manufacturers are waging a quiet campaign to block new rulesThis story is co-published withFloodlightAmes Alexander of FloodlightSun 1 Jun 2025 06.55 EDTLast modified on Sun 1 Jun 2025 13.54 EDTShareIt began with a lobbyist’s pitch.The Tennessee representative Rusty Grills says the lobbyist proposed a simple idea: repeal the state’s requirement for reflective roofs on many commercial buildings.In late March, Grills and his fellow lawmakers voted to eliminate the rule, scrapping a measure meant to save energy, lower temperatures and protect Tennesseans from extreme heat.Grills, a Republican, told Floodlight that he introduced the bill to give consumers more choice.It was another win for a well-organized lobbying campaign led by manufacturers of dark roofing materials.Industry representatives called the rollback in Tennessee a needed correction as more of the state moved into a hotter climate zone, expanding the reach of the state’s cool-roof rule. Critics called it dangerous and “deceptive”.“The new law will lead to higher energy costs and greater heat-related illnesses and deaths,” state representative Harold Love and the Rev Jon Robinson said in a statement.It will, critics warned, make Nashville, Memphis and other cities hotter – particularly in underserved Black and Latino communities, where many struggle to pay their utility bills. Similar lobbying has played out in Denver and Baltimore and at the national level.Industry groups have questioned the decades-old science behind cool roofs, downplayed the benefits and warned of reduced choice and unintended consequences. “A one-size-fits-all approach doesn’t consider climate variation across different regions,” wrote Ellen Thorp, the executive director of the EPDM Roofing Association, a DC-based national group that represents an industry built primarily on dark materials.View image in fullscreenRusty Grills in Nashville in 2023.Photograph: George Walker IV/APBut the weight of the scientific evidence is clear: on hot days, light-colored roofs can stay more than 50 degrees cooler than dark ones, helping cut energy use, curb greenhouse gas emissions and reduce heat-related illnesses and deaths. Onerecent studyfound that reflective roofs could have saved the lives of more than 240 people who died in London’s 2018 heatwave.At least eight states – and more than a dozen cities in other states – have adopted cool-roof requirements, according to theSmart Surfaces Coalition, a national group of public health and environmental groups that promote reflective roofs, trees and other solutions to make cities healthier.Industry representatives lobbied successfully in recent months against expanding cool roof recommendations in national professional energy efficiency codes – the standards that many cities and states use to set building regulations.The stakes are high. As global temperatures rise and heatwavesgrow more deadly, roofs have become battlefields in a consequential climate war. It’s happening as the Trump administration and Congressmove to derailmeasures designed to make appliances and buildings more energy efficient.Why roof color mattersThe principle is simple: light-colored roofs reflect sunlight, so buildings stay cooler. Dark ones absorb heat, driving up temperatures inside buildings and in the surrounding air.Roofs comprise up to one-fourth of the surface area of major US cities, researchers say, so the color of roofs can make a big difference in urban areas.Just how hot can dark roofs get?“You can physically burn your hands on these roofs,” said Bill Updike, who used to install solar panels and now works for the Smart Surfaces Coalition.Study after study has confirmed the benefits of light-colored roofs. They save energy, lower air-conditioning bills and reduce city temperatures. They help prevent heat-related illnesses. And they typically cost no more than dark roofs.Astudyby the US Department of Energy’s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory found that a cool roof on a home in central California saved 20% in annual energy costs.View image in fullscreenA researcher from the Berkeley lab perform tests on cooling materials.Photograph: Thor Swift/Berkeley LabIn a three-story rowhouse in Baltimore, Owen Henry discovered what a difference a cool roof can make.Living in a part of the city with few trees – and where summer temperatures often climb into the 90s – Henry wanted to trim his power bills and stay cooler while working in his third-floor office. So in 2023, he used $100 worth of white reflective roof paint to coat his roof.Henry said he and his wife immediately saw the indoor temperature drop. They reduced their electricity use – by 24%.Cool roofs, hot debateKnown for its durability, a black synthetic rubber known as EPDM once dominated commercial roofing. But in recent years, it has been surpassed by TPO, a plastic single-ply material that is typically white and better-suited to meet the growing demand for reflective roofs.Leading EPDM manufacturers – including Johns Manville, Carlisle SynTec and Elevate, a division of the Swiss multinational company Holcim – also make reflective roofing materials. But they have fought against regulations that threaten to further diminish their market share.In an emailed response to Floodlight’s questions, Thorp argued that many of the studies cited to support cool roof mandates leave out important factors, such as local climate variations, roof type, tree canopy and insulation thickness.Rolls of EPDM in a roofing supply store in Charlotte, North Carolina.Photograph: Ames Alexander/FloodlightShe pointed to arecent studyby Harvard researchers who concluded that white roofs and pavements may reduce precipitation, causing temperatures to unexpectedly increase in surrounding regions.But Haider Taha, a leading expert on urban heat, identified flaws in the Harvard study, stating: “The study’s conclusions fail to provide actionable insights for urban cooling strategies or policymaking.”A fight over cool roofs in BaltimoreWhen Baltimore debated a cool roof ordinance in 2022, Thorp’s group and the Asphalt Roofing Manufacturers Association (ARMA) lobbied hard against it, arguing that dark roofs are the most efficient choice in “northern climates like Baltimore”.In cold climates, industry representatives note, cool roofs can lead to higher winter heating bills.“Current research does not support the adoption of cool roofs as a measure that will achieve improved energy efficiency or reduced urban heat island,” Thorp wrote in a letter to one council member.Multiple studies show otherwise. They’ve concluded that reflective roofs do save energy and cool cities by easing the “urban heat island effect” – the extra heat that gets trapped in many city neighborhoods because buildings and pavement soak up the sun.Researchers have also found that even in most cold North American climates, the energy savings from cool roofs during warmer months outweigh any added heating costs in the winter.Despite the opposition, Baltimore passed acool-roof ordinancein 2023.Opponents of cool roof requirements like Baltimore’s say they oversimplify a complex issue. In an email to Floodlight, ARMA executive vice-president Reed Hitchcock said such rules aren’t a “magic bullet”. He encouraged regulators to consider a “whole building approach” – one that weighs insulation, shading and climate in addition to roof color to preserve design flexibility and consumer choice.Henry, the Baltimore homeowner, said he thinks the city’s ordinance will help all residents. “Phooey to any manufacturer that’s going to try and stop us from maintaining our community and making it a pleasant place to live,” he said.Industry gets its way in Denver and TennesseeElsewhere, the industry’s lobbyists have notched victories. They lobbied successfully to water down a cool-roof ordinance in Denver and to block stricter standards by the American Society of Heating, Refrigeration and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), a professional organization that creates model standards for city and state regulations.The current ASHRAE standard recommends reflective roofs on commercial buildings in US climate zones 1, 2 and 3, the country’s hottest regions. Those include most of the south, Hawaii, almost all of Texas, areas along the Mexican border and most of California.View image in fullscreenWorkers lay down white PVC roofing material on a commercial building in Massachusetts.Photograph: Courtesy of the Vinyl Roofing Division of the Chemical Fabrics and Film AssociationSaid Thorp in a recentinterview: “We’ve been able to stop all of those … mandates from creeping into climate zone 4 and 5.”Another group headed by Thorp, theCoalition for Sustainable Roofing, worked with the lobbyist to propose the bill that eliminated Tennessee’s cool-roof requirement.That rule once applied to commercial buildings in just 14 of the state’s 95 counties, but an update to climate maps in 2021 expanded the requirements to 20 more counties, including its most populous urban area, Nashville.As mercury rises, homeowner chooses a reflective roofBrian Spear, a homeowner in Tempe, Arizona, has lived in the Phoenix area since the 1980s, back when there were fewer than 30 days a year when the temperature reached 110F. Last year, there were 70 of those days – the highest on record — followed only by 2023, when there were 55 days of 110F plus.These days, summer mornings start out scorching, he says, “and I feel like if you go outside between 10am and 4pm, it’s dangerous”.Spear says he’ll soon replace the ageing roof on an Airbnb home that he owns. After weighing the usual concerns – cost and aesthetics – he has chosen a surface that he believes will help rather than harm: a gray metal roof with a reflective coating.“If someone told me you couldn’t put a dark roof on your house … I’d understand,” he said. “I’m all about it being for the common good.”Floodlightis a non-profit newsroom that partners with local and national outlets to investigate the powerful interests stalling climate action.

But until now there has been little evidence of the impact it could have after diagnosis, with little support for incorporating exercise into patients’ routines.Now a world-first trial involving patients from the US, UK, Australia, France, Canada and Israel has found that a structured exercise regime after treatment can dramatically reduce the risk of dying, the disease returning or a new cancer developing.The results were presented in Chicago at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (Asco) annual meeting, the world’s largest cancer conference, and published in the New England Journal of Medicine.For the first time in medical history, there was clear evidence that exercise was even better at preventing cancer recurrence and death than many of the drugs currently prescribed to patients, one of the world’s top cancer doctors said.Dr Julie Gralow, the chief medical officer of Asco, who was not involved in the decade-long study, said the quality of its findings was the “highest level of evidence” and would lead to “a major shift in understanding the importance of encouraging physical activity during and after treatment”.Patients who began a structured exercise regime with the help of a personal trainer or health coach after they completed treatment had a 37% lower risk of death and a 28% lower risk of recurrent or new cancers developing, compared with patients who received only health advice, the trial found.Asked to put the effect of exercise on cancer patients’ outcomes into context, Gralow said: “We titled [the session it was presented in] As Good as a Drug. I would have retitled it Better than a Drug, because you don’t have all the side-effects.”“It’s the same magnitude of benefit of many drugs that get approved for this kind of magnitude of benefit – 28% decreased risk of occurrence, 37% decreased risk of death. Drugs get approved for less than that, and they’re expensive and they’re toxic.”“When I started three decades ago it was still the era where we’d be gentle and say, don’t overdo yourself when you’re on chemo. We’ve reversed that,” she added. “I would say [exercise is] better than a drug.”Bowel cancer rising among under-50s worldwide, research findsRead moreIn the trial, researchers enrolled 889 colon cancer patients between 2009 and 2023. Most (90%) had stage three disease. Patients were randomly assigned to take part in a structured exercise programme (445) or to just receive a healthy lifestyle booklet (444).Those in the exercise group worked with a personal trainer twice a month for coaching sessions and supervised exercise sessions, and later once a month, for a total of three years.The exercise group were coached and supported to help them achieve set exercise goals. Their weekly target was the equivalent of three to four walks of between 45 and 60 minutes, but patients could choose how they got more active. Some went kayaking or skiing, for instance.After five years, patients in the exercise group had a 28% lower risk of recurrent or new cancers than those in the other group. After eight years, the same patients also had a 37% lower risk of dying than those just handed the healthy lifestyle booklet.“After completing surgery and chemotherapy, about 30% of patients with high-risk stage two and stage three colon cancer will eventually experience recurrence of their disease,” said the study’s lead author, Dr Christopher Booth, of Queen’s University in Kingston, Canada. “As oncologists, one of the most common questions we get asked by patients is ‘what else can I do to improve my outcome?’“These results now provide us with a clear answer: an exercise programme that includes a personal trainer will reduce the risk of recurrent or new cancer, make you feel better and help you live longer.”Prof Charles Swanton, the chief clinician ofCancerResearch UK, which funded the UK arm of the study, said: “This fascinating study captures the power of exercise to transform people’s health and boost their chances of surviving cancer after treatment. For an intervention that isn’t a drug, exercise offers remarkable benefits for patients.”Early morning and evening activity could ‘reduce bowel cancer risk by 11%’Read moreFor some patients, “physical activity can be a gamechanger that shifts the course of their recovery”, Swanton added. “The findings suggest that oncologists should consider recommending a structured exercise programme after surgery to improve people’s chances of survival.“But it’s important to remember that exercise isn’t the best option for everyone. My advice to cancer patients is to speak to your doctor before taking on any new physical activity.”The findings are likely to change global practice, with doctors worldwide urged to discuss exercise regimens with their patients following treatment, oncologists in Chicago said.While this study followed only colon cancer patients, Gralow said there was no reason to think the findings would not be applicable across other cancers. Booth said trials for other cancers would be needed, but added that data from this study suggested there were lower breast and prostate cancer occurrences in the exercise group.“Exercise as an intervention is a no-brainer and should be implemented broadly,” said Dr Pamela Kunz, of Yale School of Medicine.Responding to the findings, Prof Sir Stephen Powis, the national medical director of NHS England, said it was “really exciting” that tailored exercise after treatment could be “life-changing”.“These landmark findings suggest that focused steps to exercise, from walks to workouts, could help turbocharge the body’s ability to prevent cancer returning after treatment and help save more lives.“Being more active can have significant benefits in helping maintain a healthy weight, strengthen the immune system, reduce inflammation and lift mood – and it’s now really encouraging to see that exercise really could have the power to help more people survive cancer.”Explore more on these topicsCancerHealthMedical researchBowel cancerCancer researchFitnessnewsShareReuse this content"

It urges the secretary of state for defence, John Healey, to start an inquiry “without further delay”, giving him 14 days to respond.Last week the Guardian reported the families’ demand, in an open letter to the government, for thefull release of archive documentsthat have been locked away until 2094 by the MoD.

The Mail on Sunday reported that he was from Tunbridge Wells, Kent.Both he and a Chinese man, Cui Guanghai, are wanted in the US on charges relating to conspiracy to commit interstate stalking and conspiracy, smuggling and violations of the Arms Control Act.Both were named in US court documents, which included allegations that they had discussed ways to smuggle encryption technology out of the US and into China. The documents allege they paid a $10,000 deposit for a cryptographic device via a courier in the US.The same documents also allege that, beginning in November 2023, they had sought to buy “US defense articles, including missiles, air defense radar, drones, and cryptographic devices” for unlawful export to China.The alleged plot involved them having discussions with other people – identified in the US court documents as “Individual 5” and “Individual 6” – about smuggling the encryption technology in small electronics, a blender and a motor starter.Miller is also accused with Cui of plotting with two other individuals to prevent a US resident from protesting against Xi Jinping’s attendance at theAsia PacificEconomic Co-operation (Apec) summit in Los Angeles in November 2023.The alleged target was said to have previously made public statements in opposition to the policies and actions of the Chinese government and President Xi.In the weeks leading up to the Apec summit, Cui and Miller are alleged to have directed and coordinated a plot to surveil the victim, install a tracking device on their car, slash the tyres on their car and then purchase and destroy a pair of artistic statues created by the victim depicting President Xi and his wife.The two individuals with whom they had allegedly conspired in relation to this were in fact “acting at the direction of the FBI”.In spring last year, the alleged victim announced that he planned to make public an online video feed depicting two new artistic statues of President Xi and his wife.Miller and Cui are alleged to have paid two other individuals, who were also working with the FBI, approximately $36,500 to convince the alleged victim to desist from the online display of the statues.The US deputy attorney general, Todd Blanche, said: “This is a blatant assault on both our national security and our democratic values. This justice department will not tolerate foreign repression on US soil, nor will we allow hostile nations to infiltrate or exploit our defence systems.”The FBI deputy director, Dan Bongino, said: “The defendants allegedly plotted to harass and interfere with an individual who criticised the actions of the People’s Republic of China while exercising their constitutionally protected free speech rights within the United States of America.”Miller, a permanent US resident, and Cui were named in indictments returned by federal grand juries in Milwaukee and Los Angeles. Miller was arrested in Belgrade on 24 April.If convicted they face maximum penalties of five years in prison for conspiracy, five years in prison for stalking, 20 years in prison for violation of the US Arms Export Control Act and 10 years in prison for smuggling.The US Department of Justice said it was coordinating with Serbian authorities regarding the pending extraditions of Cui and Miller from Serbia.Explore more on these topicsFBIChinaAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

A further 68 people were arrested acrossFrance.Police were investigating whether two deaths were also linked to the unrest. They included a 17-year-old boy who died after he was reportedly stabbed in the chest late on Saturday evening in the south-west town of Dax. A man, 23, who was riding a scooter in centralPariswas also killed after being hit by a vehicle, according to French authorities.View image in fullscreenPolice clash with supporters on the Champs-Élysées in Paris.Photograph: Raphaël Lafargue/ABACA/ShutterstockThe interior ministry said 18 police officers in Paris had been injured, along with three elsewhere in France, as were 192 people celebrating in the streets. Seven fire-service personnel had also been hurt.A police officer was placed in an induced coma in France’s Normandy region after being injured by fireworks. The officer was struck in the eye after a firework went off accidentally, a police source told Agence France-Presse. The agency said 692 fires were reported through the night, including 264 cars that were set ablaze.MostParis Saint-Germain(PSG) fans peacefully celebrated what was their club’s first Champions League win after their 5-0 victory over Inter Milan, and a parade on Sunday evening on the Champs-Élysées passed without any significant incidents.The players were also due to be hosted by the French president, Emmanuel Macron, who is a fan of Olympique de Marseille.PSG condemned the earlier violence “in the strongest possible terms” on Sunday, adding that winning the title “should be a moment of collective joy, not of unrest and disorder”.“These isolated acts are contrary to the club’s values and in no way represent the vast majority of our supporters, whose exemplary behaviour throughout the season deserves to be commended,” the club said on social media as it called on “everyone” to “show responsibility and respect” during the parade on the Champs-Élysées.But a political row broke out over the policing of Saturday night’s events as football once again became a backdrop for tensions in French society.View image in fullscreenA riot police officer takes aim with a projectile launcher in Paris on Saturday night.Photograph: Raphaël Lafargue/ABACA/ShutterstockFrance’s interior minister, Bruno Retailleau, posted on social media on Saturday after the game: “True PSG fans are getting excited about their team’s magnificent performance. Meanwhile, barbarians have taken to the streets of Paris to commit crimes and provoke law enforcement … It is unbearable that it is not possible to party without fearing the savagery of a minority of thugs who respect nothing.”Antoine Léaument, a member of the radical left party La France Insoumise (France Unbowed), criticised the use of teargas on the Champs-Élysées and questioned its use against what he described as a “peaceful gathering”.“Bruno Retailleau uses barbaric methods. Firing teargas into a crowd is extremely dangerous. He is responsible for the chaos,” Léaument said on X, where he posted a video showing himself and others amid teargas on the avenue on Saturday night.Jordan Bardella, the president of the far-right party Rassemblement National (National Rally), sought to make political capital out of the unrest, claiming that Paris had become “a playground for thugs”.Many of the stars of the team, one of the youngest in the competition, are drawn from the huge football talent pool in the Paris suburbs, which have also become a focal point for claims of lawlessness by the far right.View image in fullscreenRiot police on the Champs-Élysées in Paris after the match.Photograph: Abdul Saboor/ReutersAbout 5,400 police were deployed across the city for the post-match celebrations, with officers on the Champs-Élysées using teargas as well as pepper spray.A police spokesperson said a car was set alight near the Parc des Princes stadium, PSG’s home ground, where 48,000 had watched the match on big screens. Several dozen arrests had been made by the time the match ended, Reuters reported.In Grenoble in south-east France, a car careened into fans celebrating PSG’s win, leaving four people injured, two of them seriously. All of those hurt were from the same family, police said. The driver handed himself in to the police and was placed under arrest. A source close to the investigation told AFP that it was believed the crash was not deliberate.Earlier on Saturday, PSG and Inter Milan supporters threw stones at each other at Fröttmaning station in Munich while travelling to the Allianz arena for the final, Bild reported. They also caused travel disruption by making their way on to train tracks, according to reports.A total of 11.5 million people tuned in across France to watch the match, according to figures given by the Mediametrie audience-measurement company and one of the broadcasters, Canal+.Explore more on these topicsParisChampions LeagueParis Saint-GermainFranceEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Whether it’sDonald Trumpand Elon Musk in the US orJavier Mileiand Eduardo Eurnekian in Argentina, we see the same playbook of unfairness and authoritarianism in action around the world.”In the US, the index cited “the Donald Trump administration has taken a wrecking ball to the collective labour rights of workers and brought anti-union billionaires into the heart of policymaking”.Trump’s safety research cuts heighten workplace risks, federal workers warnRead moreThese actions, according to the index, include stripping union protections from 47,000 workers at the Transportation Security Administration, attempting to revoke civil service protections for large swaths of federal employees and firing a member of the National Labor Relations Board, leaving it without a quorum.Luc Triangle, secretary general of the International Trade Union Confederation, said the report covers events up until March 2025, but these trends have continued to worsen in the US since then.The Trump administration has alsodrastically cut staffat the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service,fireda board member of the Federal Labor Relations Authority andissuedan executive order revoking collective bargaining rights for the majority of federal employees.“In more and more countries, we have elected leaders that once they are elected democratically, they are taking action against democratic values,” said Triangle. “The first target of those leaders in many countries is they attack trade human rights and workers’ rights, because we are the biggest defenders of democratic values and in that sense also their biggest opponents as largest social movement in the world.”Three out of five global regions saw conditions for workers’ rights worsen, including the Americas and Europe hitting their worst scores on the index since it was established in 2014.Only seven out of 151 nations surveyed by the index had a top-tier rating on workers’ rights, down from 18 in 2015.Workers’ access to justice was restricted in 72% of nations surveyed, the worst on record, 87% of countries violated the right to strike and 80% violated the right to collective bargaining.The worst countries for workers, according to the report, are Bangladesh, Belarus, Ecuador, Egypt, Eswatini, Myanmar, Nigeria, the Philippines, Tunisia and Turkey.Only three countries, Australia, Mexico and Oman, saw their ratings improve from 2024.Triangle warned that the billionaire backers of these politicians have come out of the shadows and only expanded their wealth and control over important parts of society, in a “coup” by billionaires of democratic institutions globally that are driving these deteriorating conditions for workers’ rights.“In the last four or five years with Covid and increased inflation, people lost purchasing power and that’s the breeding ground for extremist parties to get voters to vote for extremist parties, which actually don’t offer any solution for the working people,” said Triangle.The federation of unions is pushing acampaignfor democracy that delivers in opposition to the framework modelusedby Donald Trump and Elon Musk in the US, and other billionaires and far-right political leaders around the world.“The five richest people in the worldmore than doubled their wealthover the last five years, while 60% of the population of the world got poorer. We are investingnearly US$3tnas a world into arms and into weapons and there isunfair taxation. So if we want to find the money for delivering to working people to what they really need – good wages, more jobs, rights, social protections – it’s a matter of political choice.”Explore more on these topicsWorkers' rightsUnionsThe super-richInequalityShareReuse this content"

About 17,000 people there were evacuated by Saturday, along with 1,300 in Alberta. About 8,000 people in Saskatchewan had been relocated as leaders there said the number could climb.Smoke was reducing air quality and reducing visibility in Canada and into some US states along the border on Sunday.Recent Canadian wildfires are record-breaking – and will threaten US air quality for daysRead moreThe Saskatchewan public safety agency said on Sunday: “Air quality and visibility due to wildfire smoke can fluctuate over short distances and can vary considerably from hour to hour. As smoke levels increase, health risks increase.”Scott Moe, the premier of Saskatchewan, said hot, dry weather was allowing some fires to grow and threaten communities, and resources to fight the fires and support the evacuees were stretched thin.He said at a news conference on Saturday: “The next four to seven days are absolutely critical until we can find our way to changing weather patterns, and ultimately a soaking rain throughout the north.”In Manitoba, more than 5,000 of those evacuated are from Flin Flon, located nearly 400 miles (645km) north-west of the provincial capital of Winnipeg. In northern Manitoba, fire knocked out power to the community of Cranberry Portage, forcing a mandatory evacuation order on Saturday for about 600 residents.The fire raging through Flin Flon began a week ago near Creighton, Saskatchewan, and quickly jumped the boundary into Manitoba. Crews have struggled to contain it. Water bombers have been intermittently grounded due to heavy smoke and a drone incursion.The US Department of Agriculture’s forest service deployed an air tanker to Alberta and said it would send 150 firefighters and equipment to Canada.In some parts of the US, air quality reached “unhealthy” levels on Sunday in North Dakota and small swaths of Montana, Minnesota and South Dakota, according to the US Environmental Protection Agency’s AirNow page.Bryan Jackson, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in the US, said: “We should expect at least a couple more rounds of Canadian smoke to come through the US over the next week.”Separately, a fire in the US border state of Idaho burned at least 40 hectares (100 acres) as of Sunday, prompting road closures and some evacuations, according to the Idaho Department of Lands. The agency said in a news release that at least one structure had been burned, but did not provide additional details about the damage.Strong gusty winds of 15-20 mphand steep terrain were making it difficult for firefighters battling the fire, which began on Saturday.Evacuation centres have opened across Manitoba for those fleeing the fires, one as far south as Winkler, 12 miles from the US border. Winnipeg opened up public buildings for evacuees as it deals with hotels already crammed with other fire refugees, vacationers, businesspeople and convention-goers.Manitoba’s Indigenous leaders said on Saturday at a news conference that hotel rooms in the cities where evacuees were arriving were full. They called on the government to instruct hotel owners to prioritise evacuees.Grand Chief Kyra Wilson of the Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs said it was one of the largest evacuations in the province since the 1990s.She said at a news conference: “It’s really sad to see our children having to sleep on floors. People are sitting, waiting in hallways, waiting outside, and right now we just need people to come together. People are tired.”Canada’s wildfire season runs from May to September. Its worst ever wildfire season was in 2023, which choked much of North America with dangerous smoke for months.Explore more on these topicsWildfiresCanadaAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

If that kind of silver screen nihilism sounds like your jam, get your long face down to the Prince Charles Cinema, recently designated an asset of community value by Westminster council.ElioIn cinemas 20 JunePixar returns with a real throwback to the halcyon days of Toy Story and Finding Nemo. The action follows 11-year-old Elio who mistakenly becomes the ambassador of planet Earth after a misunderstanding with some aliens.28 Years LaterIn cinemas 20 JuneThey’re zombies, but they’re fast. It’s amazing how radical that seemed back in 2002, with purists kicking off about how they were “supposed to shuffle”, and defenders pointing out that technically the 28 Days Later zombies weren’t really zombies. The vast majority of cinemagoers were happy just to revel in a lean, mean horror machine that gave a wonderful starring role to a young Cillian Murphy.

Its two concerts are conducted by Franz Welser-Möst, who has been a very rare visitor to London in recent years, and both his programmes feature final symphonies. In the first, Bruckner’s unfinished Ninth is preceded by the suite from Berg’s opera Lulu, while the second has Tchaikovsky’s Sixth Symphony, the Pathétique, with Mozart’s Symphony No 38, the Prague.ACArtView image in fullscreenRaw edge … Jenny Saville’s Drift, 2020-2022.Photograph: Prudence Cuming Associates/Jenny Saville/GagosianJenny SavilleNational Portrait Gallery, London, 20 June to 7 SeptemberThis retrospective of one of Britain’s most acclaimed and successful contemporary painters is guaranteed to be full of blood and guts. Saville paints in the raw figurative tradition of Lucian Freud and Francis Bacon – but from a female perspective. When other young artists in the 1990s were putting readymades in galleries, she was brushing her way to fame.Jeremy Deller’s The Triumph of ArtMostyn, Llandudno, 21 June; The Box, Plymouth, 5 July; Trafalgar Square, London, 26 JulyPeople are the stuff of Deller’s Turner prize-winning art.

Drawing is at the heart of his activities and from that he creates animation, installations and – in this exhibition – sculpture. Kentridge shows his sculptural oeuvre both indoors and out in the green Yorkshire landscape.Kiefer/Van GoghRoyal Academy of Arts, London, 28 June to 26 OctoberThe German artist Anselm Kiefer is 80 this year: he was born in 1945, in the ruins of the Third Reich. Reckoning with history has been his life’s work. His giant paintings and installations dwell on darkness. But here he reveals his love for Van Gogh, which started when he won a schools competition to visit the Dutch visionary’s landscapes.Folkestone TriennialVarious venues, 19 July to 19 OctoberFolkestone is full of surprising settings for public art, from defunct gas cylinder sites and genteel rock gardens to the JG Ballard-like modern ruins of the former ferry terminal. Artists including Monster Chetwynd, Cooking Sections, Dorothy Cross, Katie Paterson and Laure Prouvost take over such sites this summer, exploring the geological bedrock and prehistory of the town and its surroundings.Edinburgh art festivalVarious venues, 7 to 24 AugustArt is always plentiful in Edinburgh’s festival season, in many varieties and venues both orthodox and unexpected. Highlights include a retrospective of land artist Andy Goldsworthy, whose work is usually seen in woods and fields rather than museums, and iconoclastic punk visionary Linder, who also performs. Walking around the Old and New Towns to find art is a joyous treat.Jonathan JonesExplore more on these topicsCultureDanceComedy (Stage)Comedy (Culture)TheatreJazzPop and rockfeaturesShareReuse this content"

She talks about giving up medical training to pursue fiction – and the childhood memories that inspired her winning debut, The CoinSun 1 Jun 2025 08.00 EDTShareBuying a Birkin bag is not easy. You can’t just waltz into an Hermès store and pluck one off the shelf, even if you’re prepared to drop the many thousands required to pay for it. “The great majority of people are refused a Birkin, they get told that there aren’t any available in the store, which is a lie, they just don’t want to give it to them,” explains the protagonist of Palestinian writer Yasmin Zaher’s debut novelThe Coin, which this month won theSwansea University Dylan Thomas prizefor authors aged 39 or under.Zaher’s unnamed narrator, a Palestinian woman living in New York, has to get to grips with Hermès’s exclusive and elusive sales policies – which seem to privilege loyal customers – after being drawn into a Birkin reselling operation.The Birkin scheme is just a side quest, though; her day job is teaching in a school for underprivileged boys. But the protagonist’strueoccupation, in this quirky, unconventional novel, described by Elif Batuman as “bonkers” and Slavoj Žižek as a “masterpiece”, is cleaning: the meticulous, fanatical cleaning of her body and its surroundings.She develops a routine – which she calls a “CVS Retreat”, named after the US pharmacy chain – involving scrubbing and shaving every inch of her body with products and tools bought at the chemist in a process taking three to four hours, “about the average time it takes a New York lunatic to complete the marathon”.One spot she’s unable to clean with her Turkish hammam loofah is the square in the centre of her back. After one of her CVS Retreats, she begins to feel something “blazing and spinning” in that area, and believes it is a coin, a silver shekel, that she swallowed during a car ride as a child. Naturally, the coin becomes a fixation.“Obsession is a very good way to create a character’s downfall,” says Zaher. The writer herself has an “inherited obsession” with cleanliness, passed down from her mother and the other women in her family. Early in the novel, the narrator says that when you enter a woman’s house, “you never think of all the madness entailed” in making it “sparkling clean”.Fashion is is a tool for discrimination, classism and elitism – and I despise all of those thingsWorking on The Coin, Zaher became more intensely fixated on hygiene, and on fashion, with which she has a “love/hate” relationship. While Zaher feels “seduced” by fashion, “it’s also a tool for discrimination, for classism, for elitism, and I despise all of those things”.Zaher, 33, was born in Jerusalem, before leaving for Yale University at 17 to study biomedical engineering. “I come from a traditional culture. Writing wasn’t something that I thought was possible. So I went into the ‘minority path’: I studied science and I wanted to be a doctor, because that’s what people like me did. And at some point in my mid-20s, I had the courage to do what I actually wanted to do.”She went on to study creative writing at the New School, where she was advised by the novelistKatie Kitamura. She started writing The Coin after moving to New York, drawing on Clarice Lispector’s The Passion According to GH, about a woman who undergoes an existential crisis after crushing a cockroach in her apartment. Lispector “really inspired me to write wildly, to not think too much about what I was saying, about it making sense”, or about “morality”, says Zaher.She wrote the first draft “very quickly” – it was “so messy and so illogical and so strange” – and then spent six years editing it. Meanwhile, she worked as a journalist for the Israeli newspaper Haaretz and Agence France-Presse, covering mostly culture, and “obviously politics, because we have a lot of that”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

The character’s “initial standpoint”, says Zaher, “is that she’s going to America and she’s going to reinvent herself as this glamorous woman who has no past, no roots, no constraints on her”, but “her past and Palestine keep bubbling up to the surface”.The same happened to Zaher when she was writing the book: “I set out to write a novel that was fun, sexy, full of pleasures, and against my will, in a way, the past was coming up for me, and the painful present was coming up for me, and at some point I had to submit to that.” Although the character in New York is “totally fictional”, almost all of her childhood memories are Zaher’s real memories, including the swallowed coin.By the end of the novel, we learn that during the Nakba – the forced displacement of Palestinians during the 1948 Arab-Israeli war – the protagonist’s great-grandfather’s land was seized by Israelis. The Dylan Thomas prize’s ceremony happened to fall on Nakba Day, 15 May. Publication of The Coin marked a “lifelong dream” coming true, but it has also coincided with “one of the hardest years of my life”, she says.Being Palestinian “is a very dominant identity. You live with it all the time. You’re all the time being reminded of it, externally, internally. And even more so now,” says Zaher. “My fear is that the book gets attention because I’m Palestinian.” Yet the central character is not “this perfect victim that people expect to see in a novel written by a Palestinian writer”.Zaher instead sees her character as “almost a perpetrator”. She is often judgmental and rude, and her relationships with students are inappropriate (one boy, Jay, regularly helps clean her classroom; she begins leaving him money, and at one point kisses him on the forehead).Writing is about engaging in fantasy – it’s like an exploration of parts of us that we cannot live in real life“I don’t like novels where there are good people and bad people,” says Zaher. “I find that boring. I’m always attracted to novels that bring me closer to my bad, secret fantasies, my repressed bad qualities. I think it’s because reading is engaging in fantasy, and writing is also engaging in fantasy, so it’s an exploration of parts of us that we cannot live in real life.”Aside from Lispector, key literary inspirations have been Kurt Vonnegut – “he made me understand that there’s this thing called contemporary literature” and that you “don’t have to imitate the classics” – and Michel Houellebecq. “I really connect with the loneliness of his characters, and I think he’s a very courageous writer.”Zaher now lives in Paris, with her husband, whom she met while living in New York. She’s working on her next book, a “newsroom mystery” set in Jaffa and inspired by her time at Haaretz. Asked what impact the £20,000 prize, the UK’s most prestigious for young writers, might have on her work, she says she is generally a private person, and tries “to not think about these things”. But “it would be nice if the book would reach more people who really connect with it”.Is she still obsessive? “After seven years of being inside this novel, I think I’m a lot less clean than I used to be, and I also care about fashion a lot less. In a way it sort of healed me of my own obsessions.”The Coinby Yazmin Zaher is published by Footnote.To support the Guardian, order your copy atguardianbookshop.com.

The three-parter focuses on a mortuary scandal that one of his interviewees called “the ultimate incendiary point for which we now have massive regulations … regarding cremation”.Many who watch the piece may feel the same about their final arrangements as Rofé does concerning his. The Mortician is an exploration of a sprawling, twisted 1980s criminal case that vaulted the Lamb funeral home in Pasadena,California, and its co-proprietor David Sconce to national infamy amid charges of carrying out mass cremations at a ceramics kiln; stealing and selling corpses’ gold jewelry and dental fillings; stealing and selling corpses’ organs; delivering fake ashes to people mourning dead loved ones; and plotting violence against adversaries in the mortuary business.‘A new form of mass murder’: the terrifying, twisty unsolved mystery of the Tylenol killerRead moreThe series – debuting on Sunday – in part casts Sconce as an exceptionally malicious actor in a profession with mostly honorable practitioners. And his downfall led to industry reforms at protecting consumers of mortuary services in the US, including laws that allowed for crematorium inspections and made it a felony to furtively take dental gold or silver from corpses.But, as both The Mortician and a scan of news headlines establish,mortuaryscandalsthatechothe one centering on Sconce and the families with whom he did business persist. Rofé alluded to aguilty pleain April from a Colorado funeral home owner accused of keeping a dead woman’s body in a hearse for more than a year as well as improperly storing others’ cremated remains. His series nods to other relatively similar cases over the years in Georgia, Vermont, Tennessee and Texas.None of that is to say the mortuary industry is particularly vulnerable to attracting the proverbial bad apples, Rofé said. He remarked: “People do fucked up things in every business in the name of money.”Yet, he added, “as it relates to the business of death, it becomes a bit more grotesque” when that happens.And there’s so much grotesqueness in The Mortician that Rofé couldn’t find a place for one of the most disturbing anecdotes he said he has personally ever elicited in his career. It’s one that’s included directingLorena– examining the infamous case of the woman who cut off her husband’s penis with a kitchen knife in Virginia in 1993 – andBob Ross: Happy Accidents, Betrayal & Greed, which partially delved into a fight over the renowned landscape artist’s estate.The anecdote in question came from Louis Quinones, who used to drive a van that retrieved bodies for Sconce’s mortuary to cremate. Quinones recalled how one day he was in a cold storage room where the mortuary kept bodies on shelves, and he instinctively kicked a blanket on the floor aside that he believed had been left there haphazardly. But he felt there was something under the blanket, which he removed and discovered was the corpse of a baby.Quinones told Rofé that he looked at the name written on the baby’s ankle tag – and realized that he had delivered what was supposed to be the infant’s ashes weeks earlier to the child’s mother after she had paid for a cremation.“That is another level of depravity,” said Rofé, who also madeSasquatch, which zeroed in on a mythical monster and a murder.But there was no space for that recollection from Quinones in a series that spends a total of about 180 minutes recounting how Sconce first cornered the cremation market in his community by charging just $55 a body, undercutting the competition. The funeral home he owned and ran alongside his parents then went from conducting fewer than 195 cremations in 1981 to more than 25,280 just five years later – inviting a law enforcement investigation that uncovered the brutal, illegal shortcuts he took to register that increase in volume of about 12,860%.It was impossible at that rate for the mortuary to determine whose ashes belonged to whom. So it handed ashes back to client families at random – which they had no idea about for years.Furthermore, investigators determined that, to maximize his profits, Sconce abided by his mortuary’s taking – and selling – everything from rings and clothes to eyeballs, hearts and livers. Those efforts required the mutilation of bodies and had not received permission from people who had entrusted Sconce to care for their dead.View image in fullscreenDavid Sconce in The Mortician.Photograph: HBOThe details of Sconce’s legal fate – including in connection with criminal charges that he killed the owner of a rival mortuary – are out there for those who are so inclined to find out ahead of The Mortician’s airing. But suffice to say he went on to a series of incarcerations from which he was paroled. That parole happened as Rofé researched Sconce’s story in archived newspaper articles and weighed retelling it in a docuseries styled after theLos Angelesnoir films the director said he devoured after moving to the city at the beginning of his career.He picked out Sunset Boulevard, DOA, The Long Goodbye, Chinatown and Mulholland Drive. The Mission Revival-style mortuary inextricably tied to Sconce would have been at home appearing in any of them.‘These murders still live with me’: the show that goes inside Fred and Rose West’s ‘house of horrors’Read moreRofé and his team, mostly based in LA and New York, had two days’ notice that Sconce was being released from a prison in Sacramento, California. But they got there in time to greet him at the prison gates and subsequently capture whatHBObilled as the first – and evidently only – interview Sconce had given since his parole, making it an easy decision for him to finish what became The Mortician.Some of the comments Sconce offered have already made the news. “To me commingling of ash is not a big deal,” Sconce says in one rant on The Mortician, an excerpt of which was in a trailer clip that drew media coverage. “I don’t put any value in anybody after they’re gone and dead – as they shouldn’t when I’m gone and dead. That’s not a person any more.”He continued: “That’s not your loved one any more. And it never has been. Love them when they’re here. Period.”Rofé couldn’t discuss much of his interview with Sconce without spoiling the series for prospective viewers. But what he could say is he was gripped with how Sconce shifted from demonstrating himself to be “the king of deflection” – even with respect to things that court documents presented as proven facts – to “being so upfront about other incredibly disturbing things that you couldn’t believe somebody was not only coping to but trying to rationalize as something that there’s nothing wrong with”.“And I still can’t believe some of the things he said on camera,” Rofé said. “If you [are] shocked watching, do understand that I was shocked having it said to me in person.”The Mortician begins on HBO on 1 June with a UK date to be announcedExplore more on these topicsDocumentaryHBOLos AngelesUS crimeFactual TVCaliforniaWest CoastfeaturesShareReuse this content"

When the launch of a deep-fake tool by Cory Michael Smith’s billionaire Venis plunges the world into financial and social meltdown, he and his alpha male peers – Jeff (Ramy Youssef), Randall (Steve Carell) and their host Souper (Jason Schwartzman) – insouciantly ponder exploiting this “moment of creative destruction” and taking over the world. As in Succession, Armstrong has a keen eye for the supercilious world of the super-rich, where people are expendable and petty grievances can be dressed up as utopianism.Simon WardellInside Out, 3.30pm, BBC OnePete Docter’s relentlessly inventive animation spins a touching yarn out of the competing emotions that swirl around a child’s brain.

But which maligned indie rockers will he stand up for?As told toRich PelleySun 1 Jun 2025 04.00 EDTShareThe first single I boughtBefore I became an indie kid and got into Arctic Monkeys, Maxïmo Park and Bloc Party, there was this explosion of British/south Asian music in the early 00s, so I bought Dance With You (Nachna Tere Naal) by Rishi Rich Project featuring Jay Sean and Juggy D from Tesco Extra. It felt like a moment for south Asians in the UK.The first song I fell in love withI grew up in a village in Cambridge and we’d always have BBC Asian Network or CDs of the latest Bollywood soundtracks playing. I loved Taal Se Taal Mila from the movie Taal; AR Rahman did the soundtrack, who went on to win an Oscar for Slumdog Millionaire. Taal means rhythm – the film is a musical and it encouraged me to learn the dilruba [a type of bowed sitar]. I only saw the movie once, but the visuals of the songs have stayed with me.The song I do at karaokeI’m not much of a karaoke guy. The one time I did it, I did Tribute by Tenacious D which is just such a fun, silly song. You can’t take karaoke too seriously.The song I inexplicably know every lyric toMy older sister bought Take a Look Around by Limp Bizkit from Mission: Impossible II. I loved the way they’d adapted the Mission: Impossible theme and turned it into metal rap. I can still do a fairly good job of reciting all the lyrics.The best song to play at a partyIf you don’t dance to September by Earth, Wind & Fire, there’s something wrong with you.The song I can no longer listen toMy kids are obsessed with Let It Go, so it gets massively overplayed in the car and the house. But I also maintain that the music from Frozen II is a lot better.The song I secretly likeIt’s not cool to like Coldplay. It felt like they were part of the indie and alternative music scene I liked before they decided to fill out stadiums and people didn’t like them any more. I know a lot of people who would turn their nose up at Princess of China, the one they did with Rihanna, but it’s a pretty good pop tune.The best song to have sex toSharpness by Jamie Woon is a very sexy song – although I can’t claim to have done that to it.The song that changed my lifeI was floored when I heard Nadia by Nitin Sawhney. His music impacted me in terms of bridging that gap between my identities as a British south Asian. It’s got this classical Indian vocal and then this huge drum’n’bass drop. It’s a perfect bit of music.The song that makes me cryChild of Mine by Laura Marling is a beautiful song about parenthood.The song I’d like played at my funeralUndercurrents, this beautiful piano piece by Dylan Phillips, the singer of one of my favourite bands, Half Moon Run. The image is one of a life lived and it’s just a beautiful piece of music.The Assessment is on Prime Video now.Explore more on these topicsMusicHonest playlistfeaturesShareReuse this content"

This is my ART.” Then he holds his mic to his crotch and waggles it. Yep – same old Robbie.After eccentric diversions into film andvisual arts, the pop star’s grand return to stadium shows begins with a philosophical bent: a sombre video critiques the impact of technology on the pop sphere, replete with a deepfake Elvis, and implies that only one man – perhaps one with a whopping 15 No 1 albums – could possibly save the industry. As campy and braggadocious as he’s ever been, after 35 years in the biz Williams crowns himself the “King of Entertainment” and tonight is not a mere show but a “journey”.Robbie Williams: Radical Honesty review – ‘Tone deaf, self-important, incredibly bad art’Read moreThat journey involves: Williams bathing flirtatiously in a handsy audience; T-shirts chucked out during Old Before I Die, of all the songs to choose; belting Take That’s Relight My Fire with sparkly guest Michelle McManus. He even dives off a pyro-laden bridge to hang suspended by his ankles, in a visual tribute to his biggest-selling album Escapology. Less fun: the lengthy skits with yet more deepfakes, and some tedious preaching about “embracing our inner cringe”.Throughout, Williams closely monitors our progress: “That was really good,” he confirms, with a cocky shrug, after a psychedelic performance of Kids. “I got goose bumps!” he grins, when the crowd bellows the chorus of Sexed Up. After a flamboyant Rock DJ, with the Broadway-style arrangement from the Better Man soundtrack: “I’m shitting out hits!”But the meta narrative works best when it goes unsaid. Finishing on My Way, a swinging big-band moment with cacophonous brass, Williams has the superstar glow of a man living up to that regal title. The encore then begins with Feel, a song which stares bleakly at “the role [he’s] been given” and for the first time Williams is utterly sombre. The contrast is genuinely moving.“Are you not entertained?” he roars gladiatorially, as we karaoke to Angels. Of course we are! Tonight’s frenzied, overcompensating maximalism could indicate a dash of insecurity or total, outrageous confidence. As with all things Robbie, it’s probably both.Explore more on these topicsRobbie WilliamsEdinburghreviewsShareReuse this content"

From pre-indictment stakeout to arraignment to jury verdict to sentencing, he covered the legal tribulations of the once and future president, a drama for the ages in a courthouse in lower Manhattan. Dragon on Centre Street is his eyewitness account.A former style section writer, Bromwich is mindful of human folly. His first book captures the personalities that filled the corridors of the courthouse and the streets around it, light-hearted one moment, deadly serious the next.“The first clash between Trump and the criminal court system was shaping up to be the entertainment event of the season,” Bromwich writes, with a touch of glee.The run-up to the arraignment assumed the air of a rock concert or a sports championship. In the words of one Times stringer, it was “hotter than Springsteen”.View image in fullscreenDragon on Centre Street by Jonah Bromwich.Photograph: Simon & Schuster“Professional line sitters, from a company called Same Ole Line Dude, showed up wearing merch advertising the name of their company and toting colorful tents,” Bromwich goes on.Pages later, he introduces the reader to Max Azzarello, a name now largely forgotten: “On 7 April 2024, 12 days before he killed himself outside a Manhattan courthouse, [he] ambled downstairs to his neighbors’ apartment in St Augustine, Florida, holding a fistful of glow sticks.” Max and a friend, Mandy, wanted to gain the attention of a family of bats who circled overhead, much as the two had played with a pair of stray cats and a toy alligator. “Cat fishing”, they called it.But after the death of his mother in 2022, Max’s life had turned dark. Less than two weeks later, in a park across from the court in New York, the 37-year-oldset himself on fire.Bromwich’s descriptions are insightful – at times, withering.“His color, created for the camera, looks strange at close range,” he writes of Trump at his arraignment, in April 2023. “So does his hair, coiffed in the front but threadbare in the back, such that someone sitting behind him for weeks at a time sees a different patch of his scalp each day.”But Bromwich also gives Trump his due: “In person, it was easier to see the fundamentals – how tall he was, how imposing – and to sense the way his charisma exerted pressure on those around him.”The competing versions of Trump occupied the same space at the same time.Elsewhere, Bromwich conveys the judgment of Olivia Nuzzi, then a writer for New York magazine, in timetabloid fodderin her own right. Watching the trial on the court’s closed-circuit television system, he describes her as “blown away” by the visuals. “Stripped of his power, Trump was reduced to a small garish human trapped in the municipal monochrome of the courtroom,” he writes, summarizing what she saw.Bromwich recounts the trial testimony of Stormy Daniels, born Stephanie Clifford, the adult film star whom Trump paid to keep quiet about the affair she claimed and he denied. Before Daniels took the stand, Sally Franklin, a vice-president at Penguin Random House, read “telling” excerpts of Trump’s books.“The defense looked stressed,” Bromwich writes. “There was no doubt that Stormy had enraged Trump, and it was an open question whether he could keep himself in check, even with the threat of jail hanging over his head.”Daniels testified that she spanked Trump. He mouthed “bullshit”.Isabelle Brourman, a courtroom artist, sketched Trump getting his butt swatted. The show continued. Trump had said she ought to be a contestant on The Apprentice, Daniels said. After all, Daniels reminded him of Ivanka, his daughter: smart, beautiful and underestimated.“The dizzying feeling in the courtroom was increasing … in the gallery, Eric Trump was slowly turning from pale to pink,” Bromwich observes.Donald Trump cursed and shook his head. Juan Merchan, the trial judge, warned Todd Blanche, Trump’s counsel, his client could be held in contempt.“I’ll talk to him,” Blanche said. In all, the court fined Trump $9,000 for contempt and another $1,000 for violating a gag order.Ivanka and Melania, Trump’s third wife, never appeared in court. Ditto Jared Kushner, Ivanka’s husband, once Donald Trump’s chief White House adviser. On the other hand, Trump was supported by the likes of Mike “Moses” Johnson, the House speaker; JD Vance, then a senator from Ohio, eventually Trump’s vice-president; and a phalanx of future cabinet members.“Those guests who populated the left side of the gallery in [the courtroom] were quickly drafted into Trump’s administration,” Bromwich writes.Susie Wiles is chief of staff. Doug Burgum is secretary of the interior. Kash Patel leads the FBI.Trump’s lawyers fared well, too. Blanche is deputy attorney general. Emil Bove is principal associate deputy attorney general, and on Wednesday, Trump nominated him to the US court of appeals for the third circuit, which covers Delaware, New Jersey and Pennsylvania.

First premiering in 2013, its domestic fallouts might have been unconventional fare to set to song then. But it all seems rather soft and cuddly in its comedy now.Family members are slightly too recognisable in their traits: a middle-aged father (Michael Jibson) who has taken up free-running and never reads the instructions for his wonky DIY; a put-upon mother (Gemma Whelan) who senses her marriage has hit an iceberg; a bossy grandmother (Gay Soper) showing signs of dementia and a wacky aunt decked out in animal-print (Victoria Elliott) undergoing a mid-life sexual awakening.Also, most importantly, 13-year-old Nicky (Nancy Allsop), the youngest of the family and sister to stroppy teen Matt (Luke Lambert). She is our singing narrator, desperate to unite the parts of family life that are spinning out of control and away from each other. To that end, she writes a sort of wish-fulfilment essay on her “perfect family” which wins her a holiday. She chooses camping, in the woods where her parents met as teenagers, to take them back to the beginning.View image in fullscreenOut of the woods … Victoria Elliott and Gay Soper.Photograph: Mark SeniorDirected by Vicky Featherstone, they emerge out of what seems like a giant doll’s house, as if to send up Nicky’s “perfect family” premise. The woodland in which they camp – beautifully evoked by set designer Chloe Lamford – bears the enchanted quality of Shakespeare’s forest of Arden. There is no magic but comic shenanigans and inner transformations which are sweet, if predictable. All family tension and sadness is conveniently smoothed and remedied by the end.Song is what elevates the musical above a TV comedy. Characters confess inner turmoil or unhappiness in tune, set against a delicate harp and cellos. They also sing lines over and across each other, to mirror the crossed emotional wires between them. Whelan’s numbers ooze wry humour, Allsop has a wonderful singing voice, and the few choral numbers soar. This family – a paragon of middle-English emotional repression – become open-hearted and vulnerable when they sing. It’s twee, and a little slow in getting there, but the happy ending does melt your heart.This Is My Family is atSouthwark Playhouse Elephant, Londonuntil 12 JulyExplore more on these topicsStageTheatreMusicalsreviewsShareReuse this content"

Barbara progressed from training at the Italia Conti stage school, to fashion modelling and dancing – in Cole Porter’s Can-Can and The Pajama Game, Bob Fosse’s first show as a choreographer – at the London Coliseum in 1954-55, to important roles in plays byEdward Bondand David Hare at the Royal Court. In 1966, she was in a starring role oppositeDonald SindeninTerence Frisby’s West End long-runner There’s a Girl in My Soup (her role in the subsequent film was taken by Goldie Hawn).Along the way, she transformed herself from a blond, beehive hair-styled cockney “dolly bird” to an actor of real emotional and technical command, notably in John Boorman’s first feature film, Catch Us If You Can (1965) with the Dave Clark Five, a much-underrated movie, and in Interlude (1968), Kevin Billington’s remake of a US Douglas Sirk film, in which, as an arts reporter, she conducted a disruptive affair with a married maestro played by Oskar Werner.View image in fullscreenFerris with Oskar Werner in Interlude, 1968, Kevin Billington’s remake of a Douglas Sirk film.Photograph: United Archives GmbH/AlamyThe social mobility tag was applied when she married, in 1960, the film director and producer, John Quested, while appearing in cabaret at Winston’s Club, Mayfair. Her honeymoon was just one night in the Dorchester hotel, as she was about to make her professional stage debut with Littlewood inStephen Lewis’s Sparrers Can’t Sing. The show transferred to the West End. She was up and running.By the early 90s, Quested was both the owner and chairman of Goldcrest Films. Ferris’s career did not dry up exactly, but she retired by choice, to raise the couple’s family, and travel extensively with her husband’s work. They had houses in Ireland and Zurich and, in London, a Chelsea apartment.The second of four children, Barbara was born in London, to Dorothy (nee Roth) and Roy Ferris. While at Italia Conti, she was already working as a teenager in TV commercials and pantomime, supplementing Roy’s income. Her younger sister,Liz, became a springboard diving champion, who won a bronze medal at the 1960 Rome Olympics, before going on to be a doctor.Barbara’s early television work included the groundbreaking pop music show Cool for Cats (1956), alongside Amanda Barrie andUna Stubbs, and a cockney barmaid, Nona Willis, at the Rovers Return in Coronation Street (1961); Nona left the Street after 10 episodes, because she didn’t understand the Lancastrian accents.View image in fullscreenFerris in rehearsal for There's a Girl in My Soup with, left, Jon Pertwee and Donald Sinden.Photograph: Beverley Goodway/ANL/Rex/ShutterstockThere was nothing cosy about her performance as Pam in Bond’s Saved (given under club conditions in 1965 – the Lord Chamberlain had censored it): an unaffectionate mother, glued to the television, of the baby stoned to death in a notorious scene; nor as the effervescent, spirited Moll, defying an “arranged marriage” in the teeming Jacobean comedy, A Chaste Maid in Cheapside, in 1966. Both plays were at the Royal Court and directed byWilliam Gaskill.After There’s a Girl in My Soup, in which she managed a sort of beady frivolity, she was one of three liberated female teachers – the others wereAnna MasseyandLynn Redgrave– in Hare’s first major success, Slag (1971); Mrs Elvsted inJohn Osborne’s adaptation of Hedda Gabler (with Jill Bennett and Brian Cox); and the hilarious spirit of a “new broom” in a chaotic pre-internet library in Michael Frayn’s Alphabetical Order (1975), playing oppositeBillie Whitelaw’s humane confusion as a much-loved resident librarian.View image in fullscreenFerris with Anna Massey in Slag at the Royal Court, 1971.Photograph: Evening Standard/Hulton Archive/Getty ImagesThe director of the Frayn play,Michael Rudman, took her into his Lyttelton-based National Theatre company for revivals of Somerset Maugham and JB Priestley before she returned to the West End as the boozy actor sister of Penelope Keith inStanley Price’s Moving (1981); and as a sexually treacherous sister in Alan Ayckbourn’s Season’s Greetings (1982) – having sex with said sister’s obtuse novelist husband (Nigel Havers) under a Christmas tree laden with presents and thereby setting off a gift-wrapped, loudly drumming teddy bear.Her last major London appearances were as Mavis, a dance teacher, inRichard Harris’s suburban Chorus Line-type hit, Stepping Out (1984), in which she skilfully projected an uneasy blend of personal insecurity and dull professional competence, and inNeil Simon’s Broadway Bound at the Greenwich Theatre in 1991, a rueful family comedy.She was twice married toRichard Brierson screen: as a vicar’s wife in 18 episodes of the 1985 television sitcom All in Good Faith, and as Enid Washbrook inMichael Winner’s so-so movie based on Ayckbourn’s wonderful am-dram comedy, A Chorus of Disapproval (1989), featuring before-they-were-movie-stars super-suave Jeremy Irons and a sweaty, obsessive Anthony Hopkins.Her last film, which she did because her old friend from Littlewood days,Victor Spinetti, was in it, was Peter Medak’s The Krays (1990). And she dabbled in fringe theatre, producing and financing two glorious little compilation shows at the King’s Head in Islington in 2002:Call Me MermanandDorothy Fields Forever, paying tribute to the great Ethel and the unjustly forgotten lyricist Dorothy, both magically recreated by her friend Angela Richards.Ferris, who loved playing golf, is survived by her husband and their children, Nicholas, Christopher and Catherine.Barbara Gillian Ferris, actor, born 27 July 1939; died 23 May 2025Explore more on these topicsStageTheatreWest EndDavid HareEdward BondMichael FraynRoyal Court theatreobituariesShareReuse this content"

Picture Post’s unique characteristic was that it was accessible to all, but did not patronise the ordinary people whose lives were reflected in its pages.The magazine documented the postwar social change that resulted from the Beveridge report of 1942. Among other examples, Chillingworth contributed images of a social worker in Nelson, Lancashire, in 1954, showing her engaged in the delicate task of combing out the newly washed hair of an elderly woman. As if in contrast, he followed up with a feature on elegant fashion models in Paris and London. A picture of the Leigh rugby player “Nebby” Cleworth at work as a labourer on a weekday between games celebrated the dignity of labour rather than the glamour of winning a match.View image in fullscreenChillingworth at work on a beach, August 1952.Photograph: Daniel Farson/Getty ImagesChillingworth delighted in a sense of place and character, encountering the specific in the general, and local identity in a capital city. He developed a naturalistic style, and was able to pass unnoticed on assignment. Elements of the past often entered his photo stories, however contemporary. Jewish Whitechapel (1952) shows a news agency, its windows boarded and broken and an ad for the Jewish Evening News painted on the frontage, too high to deface. Nearby is a Jewish tailor’s shop beside a large advert for a local theatre company, its text in Hebrew, offering the real sense of a distinct London community.Although he worked at Picture Post for only a short time – around nine years, on and off – it was an important period for Chillingworth. During the 1990s, when he regularly visited the Centre for Journalism Studies at Cardiff University, where I was working at the time, his conversation remained focused on his time at Picture Post and its “family” of photojournalists.View image in fullscreenRugby player “Nebby” Cleworth working as a labourer between games, 17 December 1949.Photograph: John Chillingworth/Getty ImagesBorn in the working-class district of Upper Holloway, north London, Chillingworth shared and understood the background of many of his subjects. His father, John, was an official with the National Union of Journalists. His mother, Georgina (nee Winterbourn, and known as “Mabs”), was a housewife. The eldest of four children, John attended St Mary’s Church of England primary school in Hornsey, then St David and St Catherine’s secondary, which he left, like many of his peers, aged 15.Although he scarcely knew what the job would involve, he signed up soon afterwards as Picture Post’s tea maker. On finding the darkroom more interesting than the office kitchen, he began spending his spare time learning and assimilating all he could.Picture Post photographers generally brought their camera films to be developed in the office. Alongside and observing the likes of Bill Brandt, Thurston Hopkins, Merlyn Severn and Bert Hardy, and a growing influx of émigré photographers including Gerti Deutsch, Felix Man (Baumann) and Kurt Hutton (Hübschmann), Chillingworth was an eager and adept tutee. Hutton in particular took Chillingworth under his wing, encouraging him to experiment with a camera, and remaining a lasting friend and mentor. Through Hutton, Chillingworth acquired the skill of passing unobserved in a crowd. Like him, he transitioned to becoming a staffer rather than an occasional contributor.According to the author and publisher Dewi Lewis in his monograph John Chillingworth: Picture Post Photographer (2013): “He was soon producing a vast range of photo stories of a very high quality. Encouraged by Picture Post’s legendary editor Tom Hopkinson, Chillingworth learned to combine “storytelling” images with the written word, and worked with some of the finest magazine journalists of the age.View image in fullscreenA 1954 Chillingworth photo of a social worker with her elderly client.Photograph: John Chillingworth/Getty ImagesHaving been too young to serve during the second world war, in 1946 he undertook national service with the Royal Engineers, returning to Picture Post’s office in Holborn in 1949. He left only a year before its demise in 1957.A picture taken of Chillingworth by Dan Farson on a beach in 1956 shows him clad only in shorts under a burning sun. All Chillingworth is wearing above the waist are a pair of cameras: a Leica strung around his neck and a Rolleiflex around his midriff. It is a fine example of Hutton’s advice taken to heart: a high-speed Leica for shots taken of moving or changing subjects; a weightier Rollei to capture a portrait, pose or perspective taken with careful preparation.On leaving Picture Post, he continued his photographic career as a freelancer. He established his own business and freelanced abroad, in locations from Japan and Laos to Siberia and India, on commissions for the press as well as major industrial and advertising clients. Later he became visual communication partner in an advertising consultancy, and a marketing consultant for the Hulton picture archive (now incorporated into Getty Images), which holds images for more than 400 of the picture stories featured in Picture Post.In 1989 a selection of Chillingworth’s work was exhibited in 150 Years ofPhotographyat the National Science and Media Museum in Bradford. In the same year he was made an honorary fellow of the Royal Photographic Society, described as “one of the makers of photographic history”.He is survived by his third wife, Ros (nee Taylor), whom he married in 1987, five children from two earlier marriages, five grandchildren and three great-grandchildren, and his sister, Ann.John Chillingworth, photographer, born 18 January 1928; died 6 April 2025Explore more on these topicsPhotographyMagazinesobituariesShareReuse this content"

How I fell into a hypochondriac rabbit holeBegging doctors for tests, I worried that I was missing something and heading for an early death. Would understanding the roots of my health anxiety lead me to a cure?Will ReesSun 1 Jun 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 1 Jun 2025 03.10 EDTShareThroughout my adolescence and into my mid-20s, I spent a lot of time trying to understand my body. I was unwell, that much was certain. The question of exactly what was wrong with me was one to which I applied myself studiously. I had theories, of course. Looking back, these tended to change quite frequently, and yet the fear was always the same: in short, that I was dying, that I had some dreadful and no doubt painful disease that, for all my worrying, I had carelessly allowed to reach the point at which it had become incurable.This started at university, when I developed a headache that didn’t go away. The pain wasn’t severe, but it was constant – accompanied by a strange feeling of belatedness that told me it had already been going on for some time. How long, exactly, I couldn’t say – weeks, definitely. Maybe it had been years.After about a month, I visited the doctor. She had an earnest, warbling, confident way of speaking, which, in spite of her evident commitment to the tenets of mainstream medicine, gave her the air of an alternative healer. She explained that what I was experiencing were tension headaches, a common ailment among students, and during exam season practically universal. I said that I didn’t feel very tense. The doctor asked whether the pain felt like a tightness across both sides of the head. A kind of squeezing? Like an elastic band being pulled tight? Like a fist clenching around your skull? I said that it did not feel like these things. Yes, she said, nodding meaningfully. Every person experiences tension differently.The doctor asked me what medication I’d been using to manage the pain. I was thrown by this question; the thought had not occurred to me. This was, in many ways, quite surprising, since I consider my tolerance of pain to be less developed than the average. In the case of this headache, however, my attitude was edging closer to that of Franz Kafka. A century earlier, the writer told his fiancee, Felice Bauer, that he never took aspirin because doing so, he said, created “a sense of artificiality” far worse than any “natural affliction”. As Kafka explained to Bauer, if you had a headache, you had to undergo the experience of pain and treat it as a sign, before examining your entire life, right down to its most minute detail, “so as to understand where the origins of your headaches are hidden”.The idea of taking painkillers struck me as irresponsible, even reckless, like disconnecting the fire alarm because it has interrupted your sleep. Like Kafka, I wanted to understand the headache. I wanted to know what itmeant. The doctor told me to come back in a few weeks if things hadn’t got better, sooner if they got worse. I left the practice holding a bottle of aspirin, which I promptly deposited in the bin.In the months that followed, I began using Google to research what was wrong with me. The thinking here was not unreasonable: I wanted to know what was causing the headache, so it made sense to go searching for information. The problem was that these online searches often produce a sense of disproportion: the list of 10 things that cause headaches might fail to mention that certain items account for the vast majority of cases, while others vanishingly few. And for those of us looking for trouble, our eyes tend to pass over the more prosaic – and plausible – explanations (eyestrain, dehydration or indeed tension). Only the worst will satisfy us. As the critic and Nobel laureate Elias Canetti once wrote, hypochondria is a form of angst that “seeks names and finds them”.View image in fullscreenRees: ‘I was referred to a neurologist, reluctantly, with a mixture of sympathy and contempt’Predictably, I arrived at the conclusion that I had a brain tumour – an interpretation for which my Googling provided abundant evidence. As I trawled through lists of symptoms, more and more aspects of experience came to fall under my conscious scrutiny. Soon I was noticing lots of other little anomalies. I became forgetful; words kept escaping me. At the same time, I seemed to be walking around in a continual state of deja vu. I developed a twitch in my left eye. One pupil became slightly larger than the other, and coffee started tasting weird and metallic. I developed a mild but persistent case of the hiccups; just one, two, maybe three solitary little hiccups each day.“Can hiccups be caused by brain cancer?” I asked Google. Yes, it answered – if it is advanced. Sometime later I started to smell things that didn’t seem to have any external source. Burning, usually. Other times an astringent, chemical smell. One morning I woke up and my nostrils were filled with the indescribable scent of the villa in Spain where as a child I spent my long, dull, lovely summers.My eyesight, which had always been perfect, began to flare at the edges, as though there were always something flickering just outside my field of vision. I would turn suddenly, trying to catch it, at which point it would cease, recommencing as soon as I turned back around.I started keeping a list of all these things as they arose, on a loose sheet of paper headed “symptoms”. Reading back over that list, it seemed to resemble the descriptions of illnesses that I browsed online. The doctor, however, took a different view – and the greater my fear that I was seriously unwell, the more she became convinced that my headache was being caused by “tension”.In her recent book The Invisible Kingdom, Meghan O’Rourke writes about suffering from an undiagnosed autoimmune illness, an experience she describes as “living at the edge of medical knowledge”. She writes: “What really terrified me was the conviction that … I would never have partners in my search for answers – and treatments. How could I get better if no one thought I was sick?” O’Rourke is pointing out that diagnosis starts with a conversation between a patient and their doctor. There are important questions here about privilege: about who is and isn’t deemed to be a reliable narrator of their own experience. Studies have shown that women are less likely to be believed by their doctors than men, and black women are less likely to be believed than white women. But, for everyone, conversations with the doctor are constrained by the need to appear credible – and if you are hoping to get a referral for medical testing, this might mean being careful to avoid seeming too anxious.In a desire to economise on my trips to the doctor, I would sometimes seek alternative paths to diagnosis. On several occasions, I visited the optician, because I knew they would use an ophthalmoscope to examine my optic nerve, which, I had learned online, might be inflamed due to the increased pressure inside my skull if I did have a tumour. (In the end, this did result in a diagnosis – one that, come to think of it, was rather apt: myopia.)On the occasions when I did visit the doctor, I was always very careful to limit what I said, not wishing to appear like one of those “knowledgable” patients, a hypochondriac, who turns up requesting a second opinion on a diagnosis that they themselves have made.‘The position of hypochondria is still suspended in darkness,” declared Sigmund Freud in 1909. His colleagues wanted to make a publication celebrating the achievements of their new science, but Freud was cool, arguing they would have to be honest about what he called “the limits of our knowledge”.For millennia, hypochondria has confounded patients and doctors alike. It first appears in the writings of the ancient Greek physician Hippocrates, and then in those of the Roman physician Galen. According to these accounts, hypochondria was a subspecies of melancholy, which was caused by an excess of one of the four humours, black bile. This meant it was a physical disease, seated in the abdomen, though it could cause an array of mental symptoms such as fear and sorrow.This view remained more or less unchallenged for many centuries. Then, in the 18th century – with the waning authority of humoral medicine – hypochondria was redescribed as a nervous illness with a set of symptoms that spanned mind and body. It was often considered to be a peculiarly male disease: a counterpart to the hysteria that was said to affect women. Having long been considered a “scholar’s disease”, it became a fashionable ailment among an urban literati, with eminent sufferers including Samuel Johnson and James Boswell. During this period, several books such as Samuel-Auguste Tissot’s An Essay on Diseases Incidental to Literary and Sedentary Persons (1768) warned of the consequences of reckless and excessive reading.This trend accelerated in the 19th century with the emergence of a genre of popular medical manuals. A Victorian physician was expressing the view of his profession when he decried the spread of “pernicious books of ‘popular medicine’”, adding that there is “no doubt that the reading of this kind of literature has often resulted in an attack of hypochondriasis”. As more and more people were reading about health and sickness, hypochondria settled into its current meaning: a fear of illness that is also a form of illness.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

And for anyone who fears they may be suffering from this disorder, Dr Google promises to step in to help: “5 Ways to Tell If You Have Cyberchondria” (Psychology Today); “15 Signs You’re a Cyberchondriac” (Yahoo). (One sign is “you assume that the first result is the most plausible explanation”; another is “you trust the internet more than your doctor”.)At the heart of hypochondria is the fact that it’s impossible to really know what’s going on inside your body. A person can “feel well … but he can never know that he is healthy”, Immanuel Kant wrote in 1798. Today, medical websites, with their lists of the seemingly innocuous “warning signs” of serious illness, have grown into multimillion-dollar businesses by publicising this potential gap between reality and perception – between how well you might feel, and how sick you might be.More than a year after the headache started, I was referred to a neurologist. The referral was made reluctantly, with a mixture of sympathy and contempt. The neurologist sent me for an MRI. A few weeks later a letter arrived. In its entirety, it read: “Dear Mr Rees, your brain is reported as normal.” Over time the other symptoms started to disappear.But that was not the end of things. Up late one night, I found myself looking into error rates within radiology. Across all areas, it’s about 3-5%. This was not that bad, I thought. Then I Googled the number of annual radiology scans in the UK; that year it was about 40m. If 4% of those were wrong, this amounted to 1.6m incorrect scans – a number, I reasoned, that was certainly large enough to include me. In a study of those diagnosed with a lung carcinoma, the lesion could retrospectively be found in 90% of “negative” scans.After a brief, ecstatic period of reprieve, my fears came back. At some point I forgot my headaches and directed my attention towards the lymph nodes in my neck, which I nervously fingered as though they were rosary beads. Once again, I was sure there was something seriously wrong with me – and, as I sought to get to the bottom of things, I found myself trapped in the same cycle of recovery and relapse.If hypochondria is a need to know, then no test is likely to offer a definitive cure. Ultimately, one has to learn to make peace with uncertainty. Perhaps this is what Freud meant when he said that hypochondria exposes the limits of our knowledge. Not simply a gap that could be filled with new information, but a more categorical deficiency: the failure of knowledge to ever bring about the states of health and happiness or even certainty we desire.View image in fullscreenRees: ‘Reading about the fears of others was strangely comforting and helped to keep my own fears under control’I’m not really sure how I came to stop worrying so much about my health. After nearly a decade of anxiety, in my mid-20s I simply ceased to give it much thought. It is probably fair to say I’ve overcorrected. A couple of years ago, when I woke up in a state of extreme allergic response (shortness of breath, dizziness, eyes swollen shut), I took a hay fever tablet and tried go to work. Luckily, my partner convinced me to go to A&E, where I was immediately given a shot of steroids. The poet Anne Boyer has written about what she calls “reverse hypochondria”, and I suppose I have joined these ranks.I think writing about hypochondria helped. Reading about the fears of others – writers such as Kafka, Marcel Proust with his extreme sensitivity, and Alice James with her wavering and debilitating symptoms – was strangely comforting and helped to keep my own fears under control. Besides, researching and writing a book is a sort of apprenticeship in uncertainty: finishing it required me to give up my fantasies of fully understanding the topic.The NHS’s standard treatment for health anxiety consists of cognitive behavioural therapy. Some people report being helped by CBT, but it’s never really interested me. By the time I started psychoanalysis at the age of 30, my fears had been more or less put to rest. But I think it would have been helpful back at the height of my hypochondria. One thing I enjoy about conversations with my analyst is how they generally make melesscertain about my version of events – the way they loosen me, in an undramatic and indefinitive way, from my attachment to my own narratives. And so I can’t help but feel this would have been good then, back when I only had one story to tell: the story of my illness.Hypochondria by Will Rees is out now, published by Coach House Books at £12.99.

Years later they read about a girl whose sister had been illegally snatched by the authorities. Was everything they’d been told about their daughter a lie?Barbara DemickSun 1 Jun 2025 07.00 EDTShareOne night in September 2009, a widowed mother in Texas named Marsha was up late at her kitchen table, scrolling through correspondence, when she opened an email that would change her family’s life. It was from an acquaintance who was sharing a newspaper article – as it happens, an article I’d written fromChina– about government officials who had snatched children from impoverished families to supply the lucrative adoption market. The article featured an interview with a nine-year-old girl speaking wistfully about her identical twin who had been taken away. “A Young Girl Pines for Her Twin” was the headline.Marsha had two daughters from China. She and her husband, Al, both employees of the defence contractor Lockheed Martin, had adopted when they were in their 50s, though they both had adult children from previous marriages and were looking forward to retirement. Their motives were largely humanitarian. Marsha, a devout Christian who’d once wanted to be a missionary, was saddened by the plight of baby girls who had been abandoned by their parents because of China’s brutally enforced one-child policy. She’d been flooded with tears after reading an article in Reader’s Digest about a man who threw his four-year-old daughter down a well so he could have a son. They had adopted their first daughter, Victoria, in 1999 and their second, Esther, in 2002.“Could Esther be the missing twin?” the acquaintance, also an adoptive mother, had written in the email.Marsha shook her head. There was no possibility. Confirming her daughters were asleep, she went to a hallway closet and pulled out a briefcase containing the adoption papers, then riffled through until she found what she was looking for: a certificate attesting to the child’s origins and their legitimate status as an orphan. “Shao Fuquan … found abandoned at the gate of theQiaotou Bamboo Craft Plant of Shaoyang Cityon 4 June 2002 … Wecannotfind her natural parents and other relatives up to now.”She was reassured. Then she turned to the article online and read more carefully. The twin had been taken near Shaoyang, China, where Esther’s orphanage was located; a dozen local officials had “stormed the house and grabbed the 20-month-old” on 30 May 2002. That was less than a week before the girl was supposedly found at the bamboo factory. The article also said the girl had a “distinctive bump” on her left earlobe.Marsha clicked on an accompanying photograph. It showed the mother, Zanhua, and her remaining nine-year-old daughter, Shuangjie (meaning double purity, in recognition of her status as a twin), sitting outside their home. She enlarged the photo so she could look more closely at Shuangjie’s pouty lips, knowing half-smile and wide cheekbones. She recognised that face.View image in fullscreenEsther’s birth mother, Zanhua, and Shuangjie in 2009, in the photo that convinced Esther’s adoptive mother the two girls were twins.Photograph: courtesy of Barbara DemickAll the pieces fell into place. The dates matched. The description. Marsha and her husband had been puzzled by Esther’s behaviour as a young child. Almost two-and-a-half when she came to the US, Esther had been slower to bond than their first daughter. Al had once remarked, “It almost seems as if she’s been raised.” Now it all made sense. There was one obvious conclusion: everything she’d been told about Esther was a lie.Marsha cycled through powerful waves of emotion. Fear. Guilt. Betrayal. Sadness for Esther having experienced such a brutal trauma so early in life, sadness for the mother whose daughter had been taken away, sadness for the Chinese girl who missed her twin.Anxiety swept over her. She was terrified that the journalist – me – would reveal Esther as the stolen twin. Reading comments on adoption websites demanding confiscated babies be returned to their birth parents in China, her worst fears were for her daughters. Al had died of lymphoma the previous year and the family was steeped in grief. She worried Esther was quietly suffering from this long-ago trauma, a wound that could be reopened if she learned what had happened. Marsha wanted to keep it a secret until the girls were old enough to understand, not that she fully understood herself. She vowed to say nothing to anyone except immediate family.Afew days later, Esther asked to use her mother’s phone to message the fiancee of Marsha’s son who was like a big sister to Esther and Victoria. Marsha had an old-­­style flip phone and as soon as Esther punched in Carrie’s name, her last text popped up on screen. “It’s terrible for twins to be separated,” Carrie had written.Esther couldn’t understand why the topic of twins was suddenly of interest. But she sensed it was an urgent matter and may be related to her. By then, both girls had noticed Marsha appeared unusually agitated and distracted. When asked what was going on, she was evasive. There were hushed phone conversations that fell silent when the girls walked into the room.At one point, Marsha went up to Esther and, without explanation, pushed her hair aside and snapped a photograph of the small bump on her left ear. Esther’s tiny ear tag had never caused much concern before. “I thought that was kind of weird,” Esther said later.That same week, on an evening when Esther and Victoria had just come home from visiting friends, Marsha summoned them into her bedroom. Esther had a feeling of dread. Their mother’s formality reminded her of the previous year when they had been summoned into the bedroom to be told their father had died.“Girls, there is something I need to share with you,” Marsha told them. She began a long-winded account of how a scandal had erupted in China about babies confiscated for adoption, and how one of the babies had a twin sister who was looking for her.Esther listened for a few minutes, then interrupted. “Mom, am I the twin?” she asked.Marsha was taken aback. Was there something Esther remembered? She stammered that she didn’t know anything for sure, and in any case it was nothing to worry about, probably nothing that affected them.Esther bided her time, waiting until one afternoon when Marsha was napping on the living room sofa, her laptop sitting on the kitchen table. Esther was a respectful daughter who didn’t want to think of herself as a snoop, but she found herself quickly navigating to her mother’s email. She clicked on the article sent to her mother, noting the detail about the bump on the ear.When Marsha woke up from her nap, Esther blurted it out. “If I tell you something, will you promise not to get angry?” she asked, barely waiting for the answer. “I know now it’s all true. I really am the missing twin.”Afew months earlier, in the summer of 2009, I had travelled with a Chinese news assistant to Hunan province to report on the story of children who had been seized by family planning, the euphemistically named agency that enforced the one-child policy. The families victimised were poor, rural, often living in the mountains without political connections or education.The village where we met the twin and her mother was accessible only on foot, requiring a precarious walk over a crude bridge of logs tied together over a stream. Called Gaofeng, or High Phoenix, the village looked stuck between eras. Everything was in the process of falling down or going up. The old wooden homes were being replaced with new construction, houses that were unattractively built of dispiriting red brick. Everything looked incomplete, missing a roof or a window.The family was living temporarily in what was little more than a log cabin, with a door of corrugated metal and a roof of plastic sheeting. Their worldly possessions appeared to be three pigs, one cow, a few chickens and a duck. Zanhua, the mother, told me they were building a proper house and that her husband was doing migrant labour in a nearby city to earn cash for the construction.For lack of anywhere else to sit, we settled outside on low plastic stools laid out on the dirt. Shuangjie nestled close to her mother, sometimes resting her head on her mother’s knee. She was a skinny slip of a child, small for her age, prettily dressed in lime-green polka-dot trousers with matching sandals and a pink T-shirt.Was Esther  Fangfang? Did she look like Shuangjie? I thought so,  but I wasn’t sureZanhua did most of the talking. She had a friendly, open face and told her story with animation, but not excessive emotion or self-pity. Before the twins, she’d already had two daughters, and intended to stop there. But her father-in-law insisted she try again for a son to perpetuate the family line. To stay off the radar of family planning officials, who might have forced her to abort and even get sterilised, she hid out in late pregnancy and went into labour in a shack hidden in a bamboo grove just across the street from where we were speaking. Though they didn’t get the coveted son, they loved their twins and had no intention of relinquishing them.To avoid detection, they decided to separate them, taking Shuangjie to the city where Zanhua’s husband was working, and hiding the other – Fangfang – in the care of Zanhua’s brother and his wife. But family planning officials found out; they stormed the house, overpowered the wife and ran out with Fangfang.Zanhua felt bad for her youngest daughter, who grieved for her missing twin, although they hadn’t been together since infancy. “Shuangjie,” she told me, pointing to the little girl draped on her lap, “she always asks me, ‘When are you going to get my sister back?’”The little girl, with some prodding, finally spoke up in a squeaky little voice. “She would be the same age as me. It would be fun. We could play together, wear the same clothes and go to school together,” she said.View image in fullscreenZanhua with her remaining daughters in 2009.Photograph: courtesy of Barbara Demick“Yes, twins shouldn’t be separated,” Zanhua agreed. “If it was possible, we’d want to take her back. I gave birth to her. I still want her, or at least to know where she is.”By the time we had finished speaking, the sun was low enough that we sat in the shadows of the bamboo, which were crisscrossing the landscape like the bars of a prison. We couldn’t stay much longer, as it would be hard to navigate out of the village in the darkness.“Come back again, and next time bring my daughter,” Zanhua told me. I gave a noncommittal nod, and later wondered: why was I going to help this family find their missing daughter and not the others? Shuangjie had a twin sister, possibly an identical twin sister. As they matured, the girls would look alike. I thought, just maybe, that I could succeed.When I got back to my office in Beijing, where I was bureau chief for the Los Angeles Times, I thought about the missing twin. And I began to search. I found a Yahoo group for parents who had adopted from the orphanage in Shaoyang where I suspected she had been taken. (Babies set for adoption could be in the orphanage for up to a year because of the paperwork involved – including placing an ad for the child’s birth parents in newspapers families in the villages would never see.) The adoptive parents were raising money to support the orphanage and often posted photos of their children. With the moderator’s help, I identified several possibilities. The most likely seemed to be an older couple, Marsha and Al, who had two girls from China and had become passionate advocates of international adoption.They had put up two photos of the girl they called Esther. One showed her at the time of adoption, a toddler with thin hair and downcast eyes. Another showed a well-dressed four-year-old in a puffy blouse with a smile stretching from cheekbone to cheekbone.Was Esther actually Fangfang? Did she look like Shuangjie? I thought so, but I wasn’t sure. I thought surely Zanhua and her husband could tell me.Borrowing a technique from police procedurals, I plucked random photographs from the internet of Chinese girls of similar age and appearance. I printed out a sheet with eight colour photographs, interspersed among them the two of Esther. They were like mugshots. Not to raise anybody’s hopes, I wrote a note saying that these were just photos of adoptees and maybe there was a slim chance one resembled their daughter.View image in fullscreenEsther with her adoptive parents, Marsha and Al, and older sister Victoria.Photograph: courtesy of the familyI sent the photos through an intermediary. The response came back immediately. The Chinese family had identified the correct photos. They were certain.Now what? I had heedlessly barrelled ahead, setting a challenge for myself to find the missing girl, without thinking about the next step or the implications for real people. I couldn’t publish a story, given the girl’s age, but I couldn’t ignore the discovery either. Marsha hadn’t returned my messages and her number was unlisted.As I was debating what to do, the moderator of the Yahoo group – who had become an intermediary – passed on Marsha’s plea that I stop trying to contact her. She and her family, mourning Al’s death, “are not ready or able to deal with this at present”. In the end, I sent some of the information I had collected to Marsha, through a relative, assuring her I didn’t intend to write a story. I wrote to Zanhua and her family to say I had confirmed that her daughter was alive and well in the US, but they would be unable to contact her at this time.But life didn’t go back to normal, especially not for Esther. The revelation rattled her sense of security. Perhaps if she’d discovered her past later in life, she might have been gratified that her birth family loved her and she hadn’t been willingly surrendered. But, at nine, her first reaction was alarm. She felt like a freak. She wasn’t just another kid from Texas. Or just another Chinese adoptee, like Victoria, who had assumed a new identity. She had an entire previous life in China, another name, a storied past. And she had a twin – a half of herself that had been left behind. She didn’t want to be a twin. Now China lurked as a threat.“Does this mean I will have to go back to China?” Esther asked her mother.Marsha assured Esther nobody could take her away. She would be her daughter for ever, a US citizen for ever. Victoria was fearful, too, not so much for herself as for her little sister. What if somebody from China came after her? Victoria dared not say her name aloud if other people could hear. When they were out, she’d simply call her “E” – a nickname that persists to this day. Marsha installed a high fence along the perimeter of their yard. They kept the curtains tightly drawn.Victoria and Esther were already curiosities in their community. They lived in a fast-developing but still-rural patch of Texas with strip malls and horse pastures. Their little town had almost no Black people, few Hispanics and, as far as they could remember, no other Asians. Once there had been a Chinese restaurant in one of the malls, but it had closed. At the mall, they drew stares. Children sometimes touched their hair.View image in fullscreen‘I’m so happy I can finally see you’: Esther and Shuangjie.Photograph: Yuan WangMarsha had tried her best to make her daughters feel less isolated. When they were young, she drove them to gatherings of other Chinese adoptees in Austin. She bought the girls books and videos about China. It was a delicate balancing act, trying to make her daughters proud of their origins without shoving their ethnicity down their throats. She didn’t force them to study Chinese. She understood that school-age children were keener to assimilate than to explore their roots.As Esther reached her teens, she became more self-conscious about being Asian. She studied herself in the mirror, comparing her features and colouring with those of her blue-eyed, red-headed mother. Esther had an acute visual sensibility: she paid close attention to the people and landscape around her. At 14, she got a camera as a Christmas present and took it everywhere. She photographed her family, their cat, people in the neighbourhood. She developed an interest in fashion. It was hard to relate to the tall, leggy models. Esther was still under 5ft and Victoria only a few inches taller. She discovered Asian fashion blogs and was happy to see models who shared her body type. She had grown up watching Disney animations of pale, blue-eyed heroines but decided now that Mulan, the Chinese warrior, was her favourite. And she began thinking about her other half in China. She wondered whether her twin looked just like her, what she wore, what she was doing. She wondered if her twin ever thought about her.Around the time she turned 16, she spoke to her mother about contacting her twin. And Marsha asked Sam, her son, to reach out to me for help.In the end, it was easier to find Shuangjie again than her parents. At 16, she had already moved on from the village. She was a teaching intern at a preschool in Changsha, capital of Hunan province. She lived in a dorm with other young trainees. And, like most Chinese people her age, she was connected to the wider world through social media. She had her own smartphone and an account on WeChat, the ubiquitous app used by more than a billion people in China. A film-maker gave me her contacts. A colleague in Beijing messaged to give her a heads-up that we had news of her twin sister. I friended her on WeChat and she accepted. The lines of communication were open, and I was the go-between.Marsha had suggested Esther start by writing a letter. A real letter, handwritten. They didn’t want to text, or for the birth family to have their contact information. A few days later, a letter appeared in my mailbox. The handwriting was tidy, the spelling and grammar exact.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Please allow me to introduce myself. As you already know, I am 16 years old … I am short,just under 5ft tall, but I actually don’t mind in the least. People guess my age to be about 13 or 14, which I think is funny. [A smiley face was inserted here.] How tall are you?I recently started my own photography business … I love to cook/bake and I like fashion and art andmusic.In January, we celebrated thelunar newyear for the first time and we all wore red and I made orange chicken and fried rice which we ate with chopsticks. We also watched Disney’s Mulan and decided to make it a tradition for everynewyear.To avoid raising expectations that she was planning to move back to China, Esther added a pointed, though gracious, explanation:I am very happy and want you to knowI have a caring and lovely family whom I love dearly.I suggested Shuangjie write a letter in response.Dear Esther, hello. My name is Shuangjie. I am 16 years old and an outgoing girl. I am about 150cmtall and the slightly chubby type of girl. I like playing ping-pong, badminton. I like to listen to music and do calligraphy. My favourite colours are white and black, and my favourite season is the fall:the temperature of the season is just right, not cold or hot. We very much want to see you and hope you and your family are not afraid. We won’t snatch you away from your family. We understand. I hope we will keep in touch in the future. I really want to wear the same clothes as you, go shopping togetherand listen to music together. I think it’s a magical thing that two people look very much alike. In school, teachers would call the wrong name because they can’t tell us apart, and our friends would also be confused as to who is who.The girls became pen pals, with me as the courier, translating and relaying messages. Esther wrote to me by email, which Shuangjie didn’t use. Like most Chinese people, she preferred texting on her phone. Esther still didn’t want to set up a WeChat account. She hadn’t told Shuangjie her surname or where she lived.View image in fullscreenMarsha and Esther serving dumplings at home in Texas.Photograph: Barbara DemickEsther did send photos, and Shuangjie reciprocated. They looked alike. Flat, wide noses, flared at the nostrils, well-defined eyebrows, eyes that crinkled at the edges when smiling. They both had bright, infectious smiles, though Shuangjie’s was less confident. Their most striking feature was their cheekbones, wide and pronounced.This might have been the end of my involvement in this story. But over the summer, I was planning a trip to China, and it wouldn’t be so complicated to route myself through Changsha to see Shuangjie in person and maybe revisit the village. I could also set up a video chat with an interpreter between Shuangjie and Esther. When I suggested it, they both jumped at the idea.I booked a hotel, figuring we would need fast wifi for a video call, and Shuangjie arrived at the appointed time. The technology worked without a hitch; just like that, Esther’s face popped up on the tiny screen. The girls stared at each other from 7,000 miles and 13 hours apart.For what seemed a long time, they just examined each other. Neither said a word. Shuangjie’s mouth was agape, a look of awe on her face. Then she broke into a big smile. “I’m so happy I can finally see you,” she said.“I can see you, too,” Esther replied.The girls related best through gestures. Esther held up her waist-length hair and pulled it back to look more like Shuangjie. Shuangjie showed Esther a birthmark on her back, which Esther lacks. By the end of the call, we were all exhausted, physically and emotionally. But there was one more piece of business to attend to.We had come this far on coincidences of timing and physical resemblance, but I felt we needed positive proof that the girls were twins. I had bought a simple collection kit online from a DNA testing lab. It consisted of a couple of cotton swabs and test tubes. Shuangjie rolled hers around inside her cheek for a few seconds and we put the swab back in the test tube and sealed it. We did it again with a second swab just to make sure.View image in fullscreenEsther’s birth father, Youdong, looking at a photo of her in 2017.Photograph: courtesy of Barbara DemickAs she was still a minor, I would need a parental signature to do the DNA test, which meant another visit to Gaofeng village, where the twins were born. It was 2017 – eight years since my earlier visit – and we were able to drive the entire time on paved road. The family was now living in a brick house, nestled under the terraced paddies crawling up the mountains. This time, Zanhua was away working in the city – the couple used to alternate, with one earning cash, the other staying home to mind the farm. Zeng Youdong, the twins’ father, had stayed behind to prepare for the rice harvest. To my relief, he wasn’t angry with me for waiting so long to tell him more about his missing daughter.When I opened my laptop to show him photos of Esther, he couldn’t peel his eyes away from the screen.“You should tell her not to be afraid,” he said finally. “I understand she is not coming back to live in China. Just to see her makes me happy.”But it would not be quite enough. After the DNA test confirmed that Esther was in fact their missing twin, we started organising a visit to China over the lunar new year holiday, a traditional time for family reunions.I’m not sure what I had expected when the families finally came face to face in February 2019. Tears and hugs, of course; perhaps somebody fainting or collapsing, begging forgiveness. That’s what had happened when I had covered a reunion in Beijing a few years earlier, of an adopted Chinese boy with his relatives. In one of the video chats between the twins, they had shared fantasies of what it would be like to meet for the first time. (“It will be like magic,” Shuangjie had said.) None of the imagined scenarios prepared me for the long silences and reticence. I would soon learn that the Zengs were not a family prone to histrionics. They didn’t show their emotions on the surface.We filed silently into the family house and stood awkwardly, wondering what to do. Even Marsha was uncharacteristically quiet. Esther and Shuangjie faced each other across the table, avoiding eye contact.Shuangjie led a round of introductions, using the precise Chinese terminology to explain family relations. There was the number one, thejiejie, or oldest sister, Ping, 23, wearing padded pink pyjamas. The second sister, Yan, 21. The parents had finally had a son, thedidi, or little brother, now a lanky 16-year-old with a fringe hanging over a handsome if acne-marred teenage face. He nodded a greeting before ducking into another room.Swapped at birth, then adopted by mistake: 'For 41 years I lived someone else's life'Read moreThroughout the introductions, the parents hung back. The father, Youdong, stood quietly in the doorway between the dining room and kitchen, watching with a private smile – the same expression I recalled from when I first showed him photos of Esther. The mother, Zanhua, hadn’t come out to greet us, instead busying herself in the kitchen, from which billowed clouds of smoke so pungent with red pepper that it made our eyes water. Only after she had carried out dish after dish of food – pork, fish heads with hot pepper, spicy cabbage – did she finally speak. “Eat, eat, before it gets cold.” Those were the first words she spoke to her long-lost daughter.The square table wasn’t large enough, so the sisters and their husbands, the brother and assorted children were shuffled off to an adjoining room. We Americans were a big delegation – me, Marsha and Sam, Esther and Victoria. We squeezed on to wooden benches around the table with Shuangjie, her parents and an interpreter. We ate with red chopsticks out of white porcelain bowls.That first meal felt like a formal banquet. Esther and Shuangjie stole glances but didn’t dare look each other in the eye. Unlike many westerners, Chinese don’t consider meals a time for conversation, but the silence felt stifling. Esther tried to break the ice with impeccable manners and grace. “You are making me feel so welcome,” she said, instinctively pausing for the interpreter.“I am having a good time in China … I’m glad to finally meet you.” Again, a pause.Towards the end of the meal, everybody was starting to warm up, gradually letting down their guard. When the photographer pointed the camera at Shuangjie, she flashed him that distinctive smile and raised her fingers in a victory sign. Yes, she’d done it. She’d got her twin sister back. Esther gave her version of the same grin. Sitting side by side, it was for the first time possible to compare and contrast. Esther had a smattering of freckles, probably because, as an American, she wasn’t as concerned as many Chinese women about avoiding the sun. The most striking difference was size. Shuangjie was larger, taller by 3in and proportionally heavier, though not overweight. It’s not uncommon for identical twins to vary in size. But Esther was the first-born twin, who is usually larger at birth. It seemed the six months she’d spent in the orphanage had cost her several inches in height. But they were otherwise close enough in appearance to revel in all that they shared. “It’s like seeing another me in the mirror,” Esther exclaimed.View image in fullscreenZanhua (centre) with daughters (from left) Shuangjie, Esther and Ping (with her own daughter), walking to the bamboo grove where the twins were born.Photograph: Liu HongbingWe came back to the village every day for the rest of the week, filing into the house, chattering amiably, taking the same seats around the table. On one visit Marsha gave the speech she had, in effect, rehearsed for nearly a decade, ever since she’d learned about Esther’s past in 2009. “Esther’s name means star. She has been a bright star in my life,” she began. “But I would never have adopted her if I knew she was stolen from you.”“It was the situation, the government,” Youdong said.“Still, it gives me pain knowing that my gain was your loss,” Marsha replied.“I’m overjoyed just to be able to see her again.”“I’m happy she can come here and be with her birth family. I want that connection to remain,” Marsha said.“I’m grateful to you. I can see that you raised her very well,” Youdong replied.Although we were seated on crude wooden stools, the formality of the discourse made it feel like one of those stilted US-China summits, the leaders facing forward, sunk into oversize armchairs, with a flower arrangement and interpreter strategically placed between them. Nobody quarrelled, but there were underlying tensions that bubbled to the surface. Youdong couldn’t understand why Marsha and her husband, at a relatively advanced age and with adult children, came to China to adopt. And he was confused by the role played by Sam, who in his late 40s was almost the same age as him. “I’m surprised Sam did not object to the adoption,” Youdong said at one point.That took Marsha and Sam aback, both a little offended by the assumption that an adult son would have power over his mother, especially one as independent as Marsha. Sam tried to reassure them about how much he loved having Esther and Victoria as sisters.About the finances of the adoption, Youdong was even blunter, so much so that the Americans cringed at his question. “How much did you pay for her?”Youdong knew nothing of international adoption, even less of the niceties of The Hague convention that was designed to guard against the outright sale of children. Marsha didn’t lose her composure, but briefly explained the laws and answered directly. The adoption had cost $25,000, she said. Except for a $3,000 contribution to the orphanage, the fees were paid through the government’s China Center ofAdoptionAffairs; they had not been dealing with child traffickers, and had been able to afford it because they sold their house.It was an artful answer – it gave Marsha a chance to explain that Americans weren’t just buying babies. And to emphasise gracefully that American adopterswere not necessarily rich. Her family, in particular, was not.Over our last meal, Youdong made an exception to his policy of not drinking alcohol by serving us warm rice wine, brewed at home with rice grown in their own fields. We had a series of toasts and a few more speeches.“From now on, I will call you Mom and Dad,” Esther told her Chinese parents through the interpreter. Marsha nodded her assent.Zanhua toasted me as well. She spoke of the visit I had first made in 2009 when, she said, I had promised her I would bring back her daughter. I couldn’t remember making any such promise, but I drank to it anyway.I remembered that the first day we’d arrived, Zanhua had flinched when Marsha tried to hug her. But now the women had a long embrace, celebrating their collaborative motherhood. And I thought I detected a tear in Zanhua’s eye at saying goodbye again to her daughter.This is an edited extract from Daughters of the Bamboo Grove by Barbara Demick, published on 5 June by Granta Books at £20.

When we’re shopping and see something we like, the first thing almost all of us do is look at the price. What with money not growing on trees and all that. If I see something nice in a shop, then check the tag and find it to be out of my budget (or just overpriced), I move swiftly on. By the same logic, if I spot a contender for this monthly roundup but then discover it’s prohibitively expensive – which happens a lot these days, “sticker shock” being a familiar syndrome in an era of fashion hyperinflation – I am not inclined to include it.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.But we can’t be sensible all the time. I don’t need to remind you that it’s better to buy fewer good, long-lasting things than loads of cheap tat. Then there’s the fact that, sometimes, an object is worth spending money on not because it’s objectively worth a lot of money, but just because it’s worth a lot to you. Plus, June is my birthday month, so you have to indulge me, OK? So, there’s a couple of splurges in here, should you be in the market for a dreamy dress or two. But also: the £46.75 swimsuit that’s in every chicholiday luggage, and some utterly brilliant earrings for less than £20. Because, that’s real life.The perfect holiday dinner sandalView image in fullscreenCut-out strap sandals£28 at River IslandI’m a huge fan of this particular shape of flat sandal, which I find to be sufficiently aesthetic to wear with a dress for a nice holiday dinner, eliminating the need to pack any heels. The key is that the upper of the shoe doesn’t cover your toes, and doesn’t extend too close to where your foot bends at the ankle. Straps across the front of the ankle rarely look good without a heel. Dismiss anything with a kitten heel (impractical), anything with a dividing post between the toes (blisters) and anything with metal touching your skin (hot). These are pretty perfect, in tan suede or chocolate leather.In praise of the party skirtView image in fullscreenCrystal maxi skirt£155 at Odd MuseThis is a two-in-one to introduce you to a useful concept (the party skirt) and a useful brand (Odd Muse). A really fancy long skirt – think pearls or fringing or feathers – looks chic for a daytime summer do (white shirt, flat sandals, sunglasses) and will be perfect with a neat sweater and kitten heels for winter parties. This maxi skirt comes in white, mint and black (now almost sold out in the latter). Odd Muse is one to keep an eye on. I hummed and hawed and missed out on the Odd Muse piece I coveted this season – the pearl-dottedUltimate Muse Embellished Midi Dress, £165, now sold out in most sizes – but the skirt is equally fabulous.The most adorable earrings on the high street right nowView image in fullscreenDominoearrings£15.99 at ZaraThese earrings hit that perfect sweet spot of being novelty enough to be interesting and a bit of a conversation-starter without ever suggesting that you’re anything less than sophisticated. J’adore.A high-street dress that looks like catwalk (caveat: it’s £595)View image in fullscreenElizabeth dress£595 at Reiss£595 at NextThere are two ways of looking at the £595 price tag on this Reiss dress. The first, obviously, is that almost £600 is a lot of money for a dress from a high-street store. But the second is that this dress genuinely passes for top-dollar designer fashion, and a dress with this level of detailing – the pearl and amber teardrop beads at the shoulder cut-out are divine in closeup – would cost five times that from a fancy label. A fellow fashion editor wore this dress at an extremely snazzy fashion dinner in Italy, and it not only passed as designer but was much complimented.Jess Cartner-Morley on fashion: Spots or stripes? The good news is you no longer have to chooseRead moreI heart PucciView image in fullscreenPrinted silk-trimmed mini dress£345 at the OutnetWhen I was in my 20s, I had a Pucci dress. God, I loved that dress. When I read that Marilyn Monroe was buried in her favourite Pucci dress, that made perfect sense to me. Anyway, that didn’t happen, because I wore that dress on so many nights out – including one where I fell in a swimming pool – that eventually the jersey lost its spring and the colours faded. I still miss it and I still obsess over Pucci, so I hereby point you to the Outnet, where you can often find some summer treasures, like this mini dress with distinctive swirly epaulettes, which is snazzy-beach-lunch perfection and reduced from £690 to £345.A not-Pucci-but-fabulous bikiniView image in fullscreenRhodes cup-size bikini top£52 at BodenMatching classic bikini bottoms£36 at BodenSpeaking of Pucci. I’m generally a black-or-navy swimwear gal, but I’ve fallen hard for this structured Boden bikini top and matching classic bikini bottoms in the joyful, Amalfi-coast-lunch blues, yellows and reds of the Wildflower colourway.

At the time of writing, online orders are still paused. A silver lining for me has been that when I’ve nipped into M&S to buy things I couldn’t order online, I’ve spotted a few nice bits that I’d missed on the website. These Carpenter straight-leg trousers have little touches of utility styling that make them feel weekendy – deep pockets at the hip, a hammer loop, robust fabric that turns up easily when needed – but a sleek outline, and belt loops if you want to smarten them up.An H&M bargainView image in fullscreenJacquard weave dress£37.99 at H&MLet’s end on a steal. I love this H&M jacquard weave dress for two reasons. First, the fabric, which is nubbly and tactile and looks way more expensive than it is. Second, the fit, with soft gathers at the waist and a slight scrunch to the side, well-thought-out details that blur the details of your outline in a graceful way. The pale pink is sold out in most sizes, but the ivory is cute too.Explore more on these topicsFashionJess Cartner-Morley‘s editWomen's shoesAccessoriesWomen's topsWomen's trousersDressesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Off toTownthis week, on Drury Lane. Yes, a restaurant called Town, one word, so a bit of a challenge to find online. Then again, perhaps by the time you’re as experienced and beloved a restaurateur as Stevie Parle, formerly ofDock Kitchen,Craft,Sardine,PalatinoandJoy, your regular clientele will make the effort to find you. Parle’s shtick, roughly speaking, is thoughtful, high-end Mediterranean cooking and warm, professional hospitality, so the longer I thought about him opening a new place in London’s theatre heartland and calling it just Town, the more it made sense.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Yes, Town may be up at the less pretty end of this famous road, next door to a Travelodge and in the shadow of the lesser-knownGillian Lynne theatre, but whenever I hear the words “Drury Lane”, I’m whisked back to the impossible glamour of the start of theRoyal Variety Performanceon the BBC and people in tiaras exiting Rolls-Royces. Drury Lane, the commentator used to say, was the glitzy epicentre of London town, and Parle’s new restaurant certainly captures some of the essence of that yesteryear ritz. It’s a big, beautiful, ballsy, expensive-looking beast; a sleek, capacious, ever-so-slightly Austin Powers-esque, shiny-floored, caramel-coloured pleasure palace. It has a vivid, neon-green brightly lit open kitchen and thick 3D burgundy wall tiles that speak of expensive ceramic deliveries from the genre of Italian supplier that makesKevin McCloudclutch his face and sigh, “Well, this spells problems for the budget.”View image in fullscreenTown’s fried sage leaves: a signature dish that comes drizzled with heather honey.Thankfully, the budget for Town’s decor – and how many portions of deep-fried sage leaves they need to sell to recoup it – is not my problem. All I know is that I was having a jolly old time from the second I sat down to sip on a naked flame non-alcoholic cocktail while feeling like Princess Michael of Kent circa 1988 hiding from a Royal Command Performance. And that was before I’d even glanced at the menu to choose between Town’s cod and clam curry with mussels, rhubarb and ghee flatbread and the Welsh lobster with lardo and house XO sauce, or indeed found room for the morello cherry clafoutis with thick cream.Town’s menu, I should warn you, is not for anyone with a meek appetite, or those hoping for a Slimming World Body Magic award by the summer. Example: the fresh, warm potato sourdough from the “snacks” section of the menu comes with a bowl of bone marrow dipping gravy. Order Parle’s signature fried sage leaves, and they’ll arrive drizzled with heather honey. If you attempt to hide away with the 100-Acre radishes, they come in a thick puddle of miso hummus. This restaurant is a feeder. Other snacks are the likes of gildas, caviar with homemade beef fat crisps andCoombeshead’s cured mangalitsa shoulder.View image in fullscreen‘Eminently devourable’: Town’s ‘sublime’ Kashmiri saffron risotto with roasted bone marrow.Initially, I suspected that Town might be a pre-theatre restaurant designed to scoop up tourists in search of a deal, but it turns out that the food is far too good to rush through in an hour. And anyway, does anyone really want to sit through two and a half hours of Much Ado About Nothing after devouring a whopping great portion of sublime Kashmiri saffron risotto with yet more bone marrow, or a huge pork chop with seasonal onions, a rich, burnt apple sauce and hot mustard? Both of those dishes were finely executed, eminently devourable and teetering on the edge of a bit bloody much. We shared a side of beef fat pink fir potatoes that held good on their promise, because each one came enrobed in thick, bottom-of-the-tin, Sunday lunch-style beef fat.Right now, Town is manageably quiet, but it won’t be for long, and nor should it be. Service is bright, crisp, clever and unobtrusive, and the prices are, dare I say, reasonable by London standards these days. There are a hundred places where the hopeful theatreland diner can be ripped off in this postcode, but Town to me is already a trusted friend.View image in fullscreen‘The star of the show’: Town’s morello cherry clafoutis is served with ‘much, much too much clotted cream’ (not that anyone’s complaining).Photograph: Amy Heycock/The GuardianThe dessert menu offers no let-up on the excess, extra thought and ecstasy, either. We shared a single scoop of pale green Uji matcha ice-cream festooned in crunchy brittle and perched in a pool of sweet miso caramel. Then, the star of the show, a hot-from-the-oven, damp, sticky cherry clafoutis served with much, much too much clotted cream. Parle has taken to theatreland with another sterling performance: a great first act, a strong middle section and a thoroughly satisfying denouement. Unmissable.

Thick and comfortingly creamy, it might feel a tad wintry were it not for the sweet, briny clams, which sing of sea breezes and sunshine. Though the name derives from the Frenchchaudière, or cauldron, chowder is New England through and through, and best eaten in the fresh air, whether that’s in Cape Cod or Capel-le-Ferne.Prep40 minSoak20 minCook30 minServes42kg live clams, or defrosted in-shell frozen clamsSalt and black pepper200g thick unsmoked bacon, or pancetta1 onion2 medium waxy potatoes1 bay leaf2 tbsp plain flour150ml double or whipping creamA knob of butter1 A note on the clamsView image in fullscreenThough they’re abundant along our coastline, clams aren’t terribly popular in this country. Fishmongers and some supermarkets (eg Morrisons) often have live clams; they can also be found online, and in the freezer section of bigger supermarkets and in Asian food stores. Unfortunately, US-style tinned clams in juice aren’t that widely available in the UK, and seeing as it’s those cooking juices that make this dish, Italian jarred clams in brine don’t really work here.2 Purge the clamsView image in fullscreenTo prepare the clams, discard any with broken shells and give the rest a good scrub. If using live clams, rather than frozen and defrosted ones, put them in a large bowl or sink, fill with very salty (like the sea) water and soak for at least 20 minutes to filter out any sand. Repeat if necessary, but I’ve never had to do this.3 Wash the clamsDrain the clams, get rid of any grit they’ve ejected, then put them in a large bowl or sink of fresh water to expunge any excess salt while you prepare the remaining ingredients. If you’re using defrosted frozen raw clams, give the shells a quick onceover for cleanliness and skip to step 4.4 Make a start on the chowder baseView image in fullscreenCut the bacon into smallish dice – unsmoked is traditional here, and smoked will give the dish an entirely different flavour profile. Either way, try to use thick-cut bacon, because those wafer-thin rashers increasingly favoured by supermarkets tend to disappear in soup. Peel and finely chop the onion, and wash and chop the potatoes into roughly 1cm dice (no need to peel them first, unless they’re particularly filthy).5 Cook the clamsView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenDrain the clams, then put them in a large pan with 600ml water. Cover, bring to a boil, cook until they’re all open, then tip into a colander set over a bowl to catch the liquid. When the clams are cool enough to handle, take the meat out of the shells (discard any that remain resolutely shut tight).6 Measure the brothView image in fullscreenYou probably won’t need to chop the picked clams, because those sold in this country tend to be far smaller than American ones, but roughly chop the clams if any are on the large side. Strain the clam cooking liquor through a couple of layers of paper towel (or cheesecloth), then measure it and add enough water to bring it up to 1.2 litres.7 Fry the bacon and onionsView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenPut a medium saucepan on a medium heat, then gently fry the bacon in its own fat until it begins to render. Add the onion, fry until soft, then turn up the heat slightly. Once both the onion and bacon are beginning to colour, add the bay leaf and flour, and cook, stirring, for a couple of minutes.8 Add the liquid and clamsView image in fullscreenPour in the clam liquid bit by bit, stirring to dissolve the flour, then add the chopped potatoes and simmer for about 10 minutes, until tender. Stir in the cream, clams and butter. Season to taste with salt, if necessary, and plenty of black pepper, then serve immediately, ideally with a large hunk of bread (or if you’re on the US west coast,in a sourdough bowl).9 And if making in advance …If you’re making the soup base ahead of time, don’t add the clams (or the cream and butter, for that matter) until you reheat the base, because overcooking will make the clams rubbery (keep the meat in the fridge until needed). Similarly, if you know you’ve made too much base, freeze the excess before adding the clams and dairy to the pot (you can freeze the clam meat separately).Felicity Cloake’s new book, Peach Street to Lobster Lane: Coast to Coast in Search of Real American Cuisine, is published next week by HarperCollins at £16.99.

You have to take control of your own lifeAnnalisa BarbieriSun 1 Jun 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 1 Jun 2025 10.08 EDTShareI have been with my partner for 14 yearsand we have two small children together. I have always had a complicated relationship with my mother, who was a sterndisciplinarian when I was growing up,and is deeply sensitive and lacks social confidence. I too am probably overly sensitive and get anxious.My partner believes that my motherdoesn’t think she is good enough for me.There have been numerous hints that this is the case, andshe recently told me she was surprised when I started a relationship withsomeone whom she considers to be of “a different class”.My partner wants nothing to do with my mother and has not spoken to her in a couple of years. I was estranged for around a year and a half after my mother offered to help us through a period of financial difficulty in the early years of having children, but only if I officially separated from my partner and her parents matched the contribution. We recently reconciled, at which point my mother told my father that she would commit suicide if she were held responsible for the estrangement.Most recently my mother has taken the position that she will cut me out of her will if my partner continues her estrangement.I feel my partner should be entitled to dowhat she wants, and that we should present a united front. I am really struggling with what I see as manipulation at a time when I am trying to do the best for my children, and am considering walking away again. Would that be doing the right thing?Walking away from family is never easy; it’s rarely The End. If this relationship were between partners we would categorise it, quite correctly, as coercive and abusive. Yet we often fail to see the very same traits in familial relationships.That said, it’s important we remember that your mum’s money is hers to do what she wants with and none of us are “due” an inheritance. Unfortunately, as in so many letters I get, your mother is using her money as a way of – very effectively – controlling you.The thing is, this will never end if you give in to her now. It may be fine for a while, but then there will be another thing she wants you to do, and she’ll use additional threats to try to get it. If you need money it may be easier, and cost you less in the long run, to borrow it from an institution.If you can detach and see this for what it is – not love, but manipulation – it may help free youI went to UKCP-registered psychotherapist Joanne Hipplewith to discuss your letter. “There seems to be a lack of separation in your relationship with your mother, and during times of need this is enacted in unhelpful ways,” she says. “At times, your mother is unable to take responsibility for her statements and their consequences.”Any threats of suicide should be taken seriously, but in the context you shared you can’t be held responsible for her words or her actions. If you’ve been brought up with a controlling mother (I imagine she’s always been like this?), then this probably feels familiar, par for the course. But if you can detach and see this for what it is – not love, but manipulation – it may help free you, because what tethers you is the pull of money and the hope of love (and don’t confuse money for love). I’m not saying she doesn’t love you, but this behaviour is not loving.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Is she being unfair? | Ask Annalisa BarbieriRead moreHipplewith also said something very pertinent, which is worth remembering when we grapple for a definitively right path: “Your decision will be difficult, but even so, it does not mean you have done the wrong thing. In family life, and living, there are no right or wrong decisions. We tend to operate in the grey, and do what is best for us right now and hope the future is better or different.”Easier said than done, but you should resign yourself to getting no money and then decide what you want to do. It would be a strong power move for you and your family to tell your mum she must, of course, do what she wishes with her money but that it won’t dictate whatyoudo. Remember, otherwise it won’t stop here and there will be other demands. And anyway, there isn’t any guarantee of love, or money, at the end of it. You don’t need to walk away from your mother, but do walk away from her money.In the UK and Ireland,Samaritanscan be contacted on freephone 116 123, or emailjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.

It means every accused party in the UK gets the legal representation they’re entitled to – but it also means barristers may have to defend people who have done things they feel are indefensible.J McBride, BirminghamSend new questions tonq@theguardian.com.Readers replyThe error Mr McBride makes is in assuming the client is guilty and that his barrister is trying to get him off.The defence barrister is there to test the prosecution’s evidence since the prosecution must prove beyond reasonable doubt that the client is guilty as charged. We’ve all read about cases where exculpatory evidence has been withheld, forensic results contaminated or mistaken identity has led to wrongful conviction. You cannot expect a layperson to know the rules of disclosure, the admissibility of evidence or the scope of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act. He needs a professional to ensure his rights are protected. Beyond that, if the prosecution evidence cannot be discredited, he will be convicted.Guilty or innocent, the cab rank system enables justice to be served: the guilty to be convicted and the innocent to be acquitted.Nicky Ottaway JP, SurreySurely a barrister is defending the person not the offence? A barrister is never defending the indefensible: they are defending a person who may or may not have done the thing that is indefensible. It is for the state to prove that the defendant is guilty of the indefensible.Whenever we see a barrister being questioned over their morality when taking the task of defending the accused in such a case we are witnessing somebody calling for a potentially innocent person to be convicted unfairly for a crime of which we know only limited detail.John Close, by emailAfter 20 years as a barrister, and another 20 as a judge, I would suggest the rule is more often observed in breach than observance.Barristers’ clerks, who make the bookings, are well aware of what work each barrister is willing to do or not. If the work is not to the taste of the relevant barrister, they will be “unavailable”, or the fee will be preposterous.Martin Kurrein, NorfolkHow can you repeatedly defend a client you know is guilty? Surely it turns you into a liar as well, but it’s what some barristers are known for, and take pride in. And ripping into victims who are already traumatised because it’s your job to discredit them, irrespective of the facts. Yet the law is supposed to be about justice.LorLalaEveryone is entitled to have a defence. Not necessarily the best defence if they don’t have money. Professionals have to deal with offenders no matter what they have done. They are still human beings, even if we disapprove strongly with their actions. Offenders may have mitigating circumstances, which need presenting to the court. One has to put one’s personal feelings to one side in order to work with them.scouser58The age-old answer to this kind of question talks about legal representatives not making value or guilty/innocent judgments against clientsaccusedof horrible things as that’s the job of juries and sometimes judges.However, I have a better answer: think “Testing the system, not defending anaccusedperson.” Barristers representaccusedpeople to ensure that the legal system itself is fair, robust, impartial and following its own rules.With every case they essentially run a legal system MOT, and make sure that if someone is eventually found guilty or innocent they can be assured that the result would have been the same no matter the person involved.That’s the theory. But we all know it doesn’t always work like that.Ferg Ferguson, by emailIt should not be for us to predetermine the optics of a particular case and based upon that, decide if we will represent someone. That would be justice in the court of public opinion, where emotion, rather than evidence and procedure, is the driving force.Tasaddat Hussain, barrister, ManchesterThe cab rank rule is needed to prevent younger barristers from being unable to access more complex and high level cases in order to help them learn – it is almost guaranteed that senior barristers would cherrypick cases if the cab rank rule was not in place. As an aspiring barrister, I would defend the indefensible that the cab rank rule has forced me to take on, even if I know I am bound to lose against the prosecution. Because, through that trial, we will have found the truth, and brought justice to the victims of any indefensible crimes.tacobritIf a defendant cannot secure representation, his trial would not be fair. A legally qualified barrister versus a layperson does not afford equality of arms. A criminal trial of an unrepresented defendant takes considerably longer than a trial of a represented defendant and incurs far greater costs.Moreover, a barrister representing a defendant in a rape trial will know the rules of what questions are not permitted to be put to a victim of rape; an unrepresented defendant would not and, regardless of a judge’s attempts to keep the defendant “in line”, the victim would endure a more harrowing ordeal than would otherwise be the case.Gary Blackwell, by emailI was always asked how I could defend someone I thought was guilty but never how I could prosecute someone I thought was innocent.For me the whole point of defending or prosecuting was to help the jury arrive at the right verdict. If, having fought my client’s case as vigorously as permitted, he or she was convicted, then the likelihood of guilt was increased and therefore justice served.John Maxwell, by emailWhile it may mean that barristers must sometimes defend individuals accused of indefensible acts, this is a cornerstone of a fair legal system. The role of a defence barrister is not to endorse the crime but to ensure that the prosecution proves its case beyond reasonable doubt, a burden that protects the innocent.Defending the “indefensible” strengthens the legal system. It sharpens the skills of defence barristers and maintains a high standard of scrutiny for all prosecutions. As the saying goes, “It is better that 12 guilty men go free than one innocent man be wrongly convicted.”The cab rank rule, therefore, is not only fair, it is essential for justice.Lola Ogunjobi, KentShould back gardens be sacrosanct, or are loud phones and speakers OK?Read moreThe cab rank rule is correct and gives barristers, especially younger barristers, the opportunity to improve their experience. Something that cannot be obtained from law books.nlygoMy experience was that the so-called “cab-rank” rule is capable of being avoided by barristers which explains why, in areas of the law such as personal injury or professional negligence, barristers tend to represent either claimants or defendants but seldom both. Much of that is, I suspect, attributable to specific barristers’ chambers building up a reputation for either claimant or defendant work.However, I believe it would be a great mistake to abolish the rule. Even though its operation may be imperfect, it embodies important principles which ought to be preserved.Edward Coulson, North YorkshireIf barristers choose who to defend, the public and politicians can accuse them of condoning in some way the behaviour of a person who is ultimately found guilty of a dreadful crime. As it is, the barrister can say with perfect truth “Everyone, has the right to a defence and I have no choice but to do the best I can to present that defence, irrespective of my beliefs.”Working in IT, I don’t get a final choice on what I do. Unless there is a clear conflict of interest or it places the barrister’s mental health at serious risk, the cab rank rule should apply.Lewis Graham, HertfordshireExplore more on these topicsBarristersNotes and queriesCrimeWork & careersfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The caller says they are from the police or the bank and that someone will be coming round to pick up your debit card. This courier takesthe card away and uses it, running up thousands of pounds in debt before you realise that something is wrong.The scam – known as “courier fraud” – is not new, but in recent months there have been warnings about it from police forces around the UK. The Met revealed this week that it had arrested 18 people, and had recovered £250,000 and hundreds of bank cards as part of a two-month crackdown.The London force said criminals often targeted vulnerable members of the public, particularly older people, with 80% of victims aged over 65. The oldest victim the Met knows of was 101.In March, a man was jailed for a courier fraud, in which an 80-year-old woman was tricked into handing over her bank cards and pin numbers, and buying gold bars and giving them to scammers for safekeeping. In total more than £600,000 was stolen.What the scam looks likeThere is a phone call from someone saying they are from the police or the bank and that they are investigating a problem with your account or your bank. They say they need you to take steps to protect your money and/or ask you to help them investigate.Sometimes they ask you to withdraw cash and give it to them for safekeeping, or for them to analyse – in one version of the scam they say someone at the bank is acting fraudulently and they will use the notes to investigate. Often they ask you to hand over your bank card.Once you have agreed you are either asked to put the cash or card in the post, or told someone would be coming round to your home to collect it. You will be put under some pressure to act quickly.In one case this year, thefraudster told his victim he was calling from Scotland Yard’s Action Fraud teamand that the card was needed because the police wanted to check it for fingerprints to make an arrest. The victim was told if she did not comply she would be arrested.When the courier turns up they will often pretend to be from the police.What the messages ask forYour debit and/or credit card or cash, or sometimes victims are asked to buy gold or other assets to give to the criminals to “look after”.What to doBe very wary of unexpected phone calls from your bank or the police, particularly if the person on the other end of the line asks for personal or financial information.If you are worried, end the call and contact your bank or the police on a different phone – use the number on your bank card or call 101 in the UK for police. If you only have one phone, wait at least a minute before calling as scammers have been known to keep the line open and take the call. If there is no dial tone before an answer, hang up.Never hand over your money, bank cards or make purchases after an unexpected call, and never share your pin.If you have handed over your card, contact your bank immediately to cancel it.Explore more on these topicsScamsScam watchConsumer affairsBanks and building societiesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Perhaps it won’t be long before we join the conversation once again.The race to translate what animals are saying is heating up, with riches as well as a place in history at stake. TheJeremy Coller Foundationhas promised $10m to whichever researchers can crack the code. This is a race fuelled by generative AI; large language models can sort through millions of recorded animal vocalisations to find their hidden grammars. Most projects focus on cetaceans because, like us, they learn through vocal imitation and, also like us, they communicate via complex arrangements of sound that appear to have structure and hierarchy.Sperm whales communicate in codas – rapid sequences of clicks, each as brief as 1,000th of a second.Project Ceti(the Cetacean Translation Initiative) is using AI to analyse codas in order to reveal the mysteries of sperm whale speech. There is evidence the animals take turns, use specific clicks to refer to one another, and even have distinct dialects. Ceti has already isolated a click that may be a form of punctuation, and they hope to speak whaleish as soon as 2026.The linguistic barrier between species is already looking porous. Last month, Google releasedDolphinGemma, an AI program to translate dolphins, trained on 40 years of data. In 2013, scientists using an AI algorithm to sort dolphin communication identified a new click in the animals’ interactions with one another, which they recognised as a sound they had previously trained the pod to associate withsargassum seaweed– the first recorded instance of a word passing from one species into another’s native vocabulary.Humpback whale songs are incredible vocal performances, sometimes lasting up to 24 hoursThe prospect of speaking dolphin or whale is irresistible. And it seems that they are just as enthusiastic. In November last year, scientists in Alaska recorded an acoustic “conversation” with a humpback whale called Twain, in which they exchanged a call-and-response form known as “whup/throp” with the animal over a 20-minute period. In Florida, a dolphin named Zeus was found to have learned to mimic the vowel sounds, A, E, O, and U.But in the excitement we should not ignore the fact that other species are already bearing eloquent witness to our impact on the natural world. A living planet is a loud one. Healthy coral reefs pop and crackle with life. But soundscapes can decay just as ecosystems can. Degraded reefs are hushed deserts. Since the 1960s, shipping and mining have raised background noise in the oceans by about three decibels a decade. Humpback whale song occupies the same low-frequency bandwidth as deep-sea dredging and drilling for the rare earths that are vital for electronic devices. Ironically, mining the minerals we need to communicate cancels out whales’ voices.Humpback whale songs are incredible vocal performances, sometimes lasting up to 24 hours. “Song” is apt: they seem to include rhymed phrases, and their compositions travel the oceans with them, evolving as they go in a process called “song revolutions”, where a new cycle replaces the old. (Imagine if Nina Simone or the Beatles had erased their back catalogue with every new release.) They’re crucial to migration and breeding seasons. But in today’s louder soundscape, whale song is crowded out of its habitual bandwidth and even driven to silence – from up to 1.2 km away from commercial ships, humpback whales will cease singing rather than compete with the noise.In interspecies translation, sound only takes us so far.Animalscommunicate via an array of visual, chemical, thermal and mechanical cues, inhabiting worlds of perception very different to ours. Can we really understand what sound means to echolocating animals, for whom sound waves can be translated visually?The German ecologist Jakob von Uexküll called these impenetrable worldsumwelten. To truly translate animal language, we would need to step into that animal’sumwelt– and then, what of us would be imprinted on her, or her on us? “If a lion could talk,” writes Stephen Budiansky, revising Wittgenstein’s famous aphorism in Philosophical Investigations, “we probably could understand him. He just would not be a lion any more.” We should ask, then, how speaking with other beings might change us.Talking to another species might be very like talking to alien life. It’s no coincidence that Ceti echoes Nasa’s Seti – Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence – Institute. In fact, a Seti team recorded the whup/throp exchange, on the basis that learning to speak with whales may help us if we ever meet intelligent extraterrestrials. In Denis Villeneuve’s movieArrival, whale-like aliens communicate via a script in which the distinction between past, present and future times collapses. For Louise, the linguist who translates the script, learning Heptapod lifts her mind out of linear time and into a reality in which her own past and future are equally available.The film mentions Edward Sapir and Benjamin Whorf’s theory of linguistic determinism – the idea that our experience of reality is encoded in language – to explain this. The Sapir-Whorf hypothesis was dismissed in the mid-20th century, but linguists have since argued that there may be some truth to it. Pormpuraaw speakers in northern Australia refer to time moving from east to west, rather than forwards or backwards as in English, making time indivisible from the relationship between their body and the land.Whale songs are born from an experience of time that is radically different to ours. Humpbacks can project their voices over miles of open water; their songs span the widest oceans. Imagine the swell of oceanic feeling on which such sounds are borne. Speaking whale would expand our sense of space and time into a planetary song. I imagine we’d think very differently about polluting the ocean soundscape so carelessly.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

And he’s right that Keir Starmer’s cynical descent into inflammatory Powellite rhetoric is a gift to Nigel Farage.Most voters want nothing to do with the politics of fear and division, but the UK’s antiquated and unrepresentative electoral system fails to reflect the wishes of the progressive left and centre-left majority. A hung parliament is now a very real possibility after the next election. This would indeed be a huge opportunity to scrap the first-past-the-post system that has blighted British politics for so long.As two Green MPs who overturned massive majorities to win our seats, we know it’s possible for progressives to win against all the odds – and to change the electoral system, we will have to.TheGreen partyhas long championed electoral reform. As candidates for the party’s leadership, our aim is to be heading a much larger group of Green MPs in parliament, giving us the leverage and negotiating power to actually achieve such transformational change.Ellie Chowns MPGreen party, North HerefordshireAdrian Ramsay MPGreen party, Waveney ValleyGeorge Monbiot is right to challenge the shortcomings of our electoral system. However, all electoral systems are flawed and in a democracy no individual decides what sort of government gets elected afterwards. Across Europe, where proportional representation prevails, the traditional parties of power are being replaced – not by a rainbow coalition of progressives, but by the seemingly inexorable rise of the hard right.In Scotland, the SNP-Green coalition broke down. In the UK, when theLiberal Democratsheld the balance of power, they sided with the Conservatives in inflicting ideological austerity. When we had a referendum between engagement with Europe or isolation, the majority voted for the latter.The failure of our mainstream parties is that they have lost the ability to engage with ordinary people. Politics is the difficult task of leading the agenda while responding to the hopes and fears of wider society and all the ambiguities and compromises that are needed to do so.The government’s shift in language from restraint to support for those most in need might be the beginning of something better – we can but hope.Warren BrownIlkley, West YorkshireGeorge Monbiot is spot-on in his analysis of the dysfunctions of our electoral system. One glaring danger he doesn’t mention, however, can be seen in the steep rise of the Reform UK vote.We used to hear as one of the justifications of the current system that it prevented extreme parties from gaining a significant representation. Never mind that this revealed an arrogantly undemocratic mindset, the evidence now is that the distortions of the system may precipitate precisely the opposite outcome.Given the fragmentation of votes, it is entirely possible that, with fewer than 30% of the ballot, Reform could achieve an absolute majority in parliament at the next general election. That undemocratic disaster, quite apart from the other democratic imperatives George identifies, should be ringing alarm bells for urgent change.Stephen SmithGlasgowHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Changing levels of poverty and inequality, social mixing, population ageing and environmental challenges mean manifestations of social fracture and distrust will differ across time and place.Unless there is a systematic approach and investment to address the processes of prejudice, including tracking its forms with sufficient frequency, policymakers will continue with the “doom loop” of despair, inquiries and recommendations, and insufficient solutions when things go wrong.Prof Dominic AbramsUniversity of KentHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

While the nationalisation of South Western Railway and the government’s commitment to a publicly owned Great British Railways are welcome first steps, this is not the end of the line.The continued outsourcing of essential services – such as track and train improvements, cleaning, security and elements of station staffing – perpetuates a two-tier workforce and undermines the goals of public ownership. These outsourced roles often come with poverty wages, a lack of sick pay and inadequate pension provisions, disproportionately affecting workers from black and minority ethnic communities.Outsourcing also drains public funds.According to RMT analysis, outsourcing and subcontracting firms extract about £400m annually in profits from rail contracts. This is money that could be reinvested into the railway system to improve services and reduce fares.There is growing support for an alternative to outsourcing supported by Labour’s pledge to preside over the “biggest wave of insourcing for a generation”. The Welsh government has already begun to insource rail services, while the London mayor,Sadiq Khan, is actively considering insourcing thousands of tube cleaners. For rail nationalisation to succeed, integrating and insourcing all aspects of our railways into public hands must be the goal.Eddie DempseyRMT general secretaryI do not believe for an instant that renationalising the train operating companies will either make the trains run better or reduce ticket prices. The performance of my local company, Northern, which has been in the public sector for a good while now, is proof of that (‘New dawn’: first train service renationalised under Labour begins, 25 May).But it is worth calling out the Conservative party claims that private ownership has kept costs down for the lie that it is. Before privatisation in 1994, British Rail received ataxpayer subsidy of under £1bn. And it was falling. Post-privatisation, this soared to over £5bn at one point and is today still far higher than in 1994, even though, according to the Department for Transport’s own figures, rail fares had risen byabout a fifthin real terms by 2017, delivering an additional “hidden subsidy” of £2bn per year because of the higher prices travellers are paying.The challenge now is achieving financial stability for the rail network in a post-pandemic world where fewer commuters are buying season tickets and fewer business trips are being made in favour of web-based virtual meetings. At least the dividends and grotesque executive salaries siphoned out of the industry by the private sector over the past 30 years will be available to help balance the books.Alan WhitehouseBarnsley, South YorkshireExplore more on these topicsRail transportRMTTrade unionsWork & careersPublic sector careersOutsourcingSadiq KhanlettersShareReuse this content"

WhileMoroccocontrols most of the territory, the Algerian-backed Polisario Front controls land in the east of the territory and wants full independence from Rabat.Under Morocco’s autonomy plan, Western Sahara would remain under Rabat’s sovereignty but with a degree of self-rule.The US recognised Morocco’s claim over Western Sahara in 2020 during Trump’s first administration. France followed suit last year, along with Spain in 2021.“The UK will continue to act bilaterally, including economically, regionally and internationally in line with this position to support the resolution of the conflict,” Lammy said after talks with his Moroccan counterpart, Nasser Bourita.The region has been contested since 1975, when Spain withdrew from its former colony, sparking a conflict between Morocco and the pro-independence Polisario Front.A UN-brokered ceasefire was reached in 1991, with promises of a referendum on the territory’s future that has never materialised.Talks have since stalled, and in 2020 the Polisario declared the truce over, accusing Morocco of violating its terms.Algeria, a key regional player, has previously criticised Rabat’s plan and US support for the proposals.Bourita described the UK’s endorsement as part of “a momentum to speed up the solution of the conflict”. He said British investments in Western Sahara were under discussion. The two countries also signed cooperation deals on healthcare, innovation, ports, water infrastructure and procurement.Lammy said the partnerships would allow “British businesses to score big on football’s biggest stage”, a reference to Morocco’s preparations to co-host the 2030 World Cup alongside Spain and Portugal.The UN still officially supports a negotiated solution that would allow the people of Western Sahara to decide whether to become independent or remain part of Morocco.Explore more on these topicsWestern SaharaMoroccoForeign policyDavid LammyAfricaMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

About 17,000 people there were evacuated by Saturday, along with 1,300 in Alberta. About 8,000 people in Saskatchewan had been relocated as leaders there said the number could climb.Smoke was reducing air quality and reducing visibility in Canada and into some US states along the border on Sunday.Recent Canadian wildfires are record-breaking – and will threaten US air quality for daysRead moreThe Saskatchewan public safety agency said on Sunday: “Air quality and visibility due to wildfire smoke can fluctuate over short distances and can vary considerably from hour to hour. As smoke levels increase, health risks increase.”Scott Moe, the premier of Saskatchewan, said hot, dry weather was allowing some fires to grow and threaten communities, and resources to fight the fires and support the evacuees were stretched thin.He said at a news conference on Saturday: “The next four to seven days are absolutely critical until we can find our way to changing weather patterns, and ultimately a soaking rain throughout the north.”In Manitoba, more than 5,000 of those evacuated are from Flin Flon, located nearly 400 miles (645km) north-west of the provincial capital of Winnipeg. In northern Manitoba, fire knocked out power to the community of Cranberry Portage, forcing a mandatory evacuation order on Saturday for about 600 residents.The fire raging through Flin Flon began a week ago near Creighton, Saskatchewan, and quickly jumped the boundary into Manitoba. Crews have struggled to contain it. Water bombers have been intermittently grounded due to heavy smoke and a drone incursion.The US Department of Agriculture’s forest service deployed an air tanker to Alberta and said it would send 150 firefighters and equipment to Canada.In some parts of the US, air quality reached “unhealthy” levels on Sunday in North Dakota and small swaths of Montana, Minnesota and South Dakota, according to the US Environmental Protection Agency’s AirNow page.Bryan Jackson, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in the US, said: “We should expect at least a couple more rounds of Canadian smoke to come through the US over the next week.”Separately, a fire in the US border state of Idaho burned at least 40 hectares (100 acres) as of Sunday, prompting road closures and some evacuations, according to the Idaho Department of Lands. The agency said in a news release that at least one structure had been burned, but did not provide additional details about the damage.Strong gusty winds of 15-20 mphand steep terrain were making it difficult for firefighters battling the fire, which began on Saturday.Evacuation centres have opened across Manitoba for those fleeing the fires, one as far south as Winkler, 12 miles from the US border. Winnipeg opened up public buildings for evacuees as it deals with hotels already crammed with other fire refugees, vacationers, businesspeople and convention-goers.Manitoba’s Indigenous leaders said on Saturday at a news conference that hotel rooms in the cities where evacuees were arriving were full. They called on the government to instruct hotel owners to prioritise evacuees.Grand Chief Kyra Wilson of the Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs said it was one of the largest evacuations in the province since the 1990s.She said at a news conference: “It’s really sad to see our children having to sleep on floors. People are sitting, waiting in hallways, waiting outside, and right now we just need people to come together. People are tired.”Canada’s wildfire season runs from May to September. Its worst ever wildfire season was in 2023, which choked much of North America with dangerous smoke for months.Explore more on these topicsWildfiresCanadaAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Another high-profile singer, MC Cabelinho,pointed outthat when an actor in soap opera or a film portrays a character involved in drug trafficking, it is not seen as inciting crime.According to anthropologist Mylene Mizrahi, a professor at Rio’s PUC university, funk artists are still not considered legitimate artists.“They are pop artists, just like US rappers or Hollywood film-makers. But when someone like Martin Scorsese makes a mafia film, they’re not branded mobsters,” she said.The lawyer Joel Luiz Costa, executive director of the Black Population Defence Institute, said: “The criminalisation of funk is part of a long historical process that began after the abolition of slavery and previously targetedsamba,capoeiraand afro-Brazilian religions.“There’s a clear pattern of criminalising Black culture,” he added. “Since they can’t just outlaw being Black, they target something associated with the Black community.”Explore more on these topicsBrazilRaceAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

The Mail on Sunday reported that he was from Tunbridge Wells, Kent.Both he and a Chinese man, Cui Guanghai, are wanted in the US on charges relating to conspiracy to commit interstate stalking and conspiracy, smuggling and violations of the Arms Control Act.Both were named in US court documents, which included allegations that they had discussed ways to smuggle encryption technology out of the US and into China. The documents allege they paid a $10,000 deposit for a cryptographic device via a courier in the US.The same documents also allege that, beginning in November 2023, they had sought to buy “US defense articles, including missiles, air defense radar, drones, and cryptographic devices” for unlawful export to China.The alleged plot involved them having discussions with other people – identified in the US court documents as “Individual 5” and “Individual 6” – about smuggling the encryption technology in small electronics, a blender and a motor starter.Miller is also accused with Cui of plotting with two other individuals to prevent a US resident from protesting against Xi Jinping’s attendance at theAsia PacificEconomic Co-operation (Apec) summit in Los Angeles in November 2023.The alleged target was said to have previously made public statements in opposition to the policies and actions of the Chinese government and President Xi.In the weeks leading up to the Apec summit, Cui and Miller are alleged to have directed and coordinated a plot to surveil the victim, install a tracking device on their car, slash the tyres on their car and then purchase and destroy a pair of artistic statues created by the victim depicting President Xi and his wife.The two individuals with whom they had allegedly conspired in relation to this were in fact “acting at the direction of the FBI”.In spring last year, the alleged victim announced that he planned to make public an online video feed depicting two new artistic statues of President Xi and his wife.Miller and Cui are alleged to have paid two other individuals, who were also working with the FBI, approximately $36,500 to convince the alleged victim to desist from the online display of the statues.The US deputy attorney general, Todd Blanche, said: “This is a blatant assault on both our national security and our democratic values. This justice department will not tolerate foreign repression on US soil, nor will we allow hostile nations to infiltrate or exploit our defence systems.”The FBI deputy director, Dan Bongino, said: “The defendants allegedly plotted to harass and interfere with an individual who criticised the actions of the People’s Republic of China while exercising their constitutionally protected free speech rights within the United States of America.”Miller, a permanent US resident, and Cui were named in indictments returned by federal grand juries in Milwaukee and Los Angeles. Miller was arrested in Belgrade on 24 April.If convicted they face maximum penalties of five years in prison for conspiracy, five years in prison for stalking, 20 years in prison for violation of the US Arms Export Control Act and 10 years in prison for smuggling.The US Department of Justice said it was coordinating with Serbian authorities regarding the pending extraditions of Cui and Miller from Serbia.Explore more on these topicsFBIChinaAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

About 2.5% of US aluminium imports by volume come from Australia, but this is less than 10% of Australia’s total exports of the metal.The National party leader,David Littleproud, said Albanese should convince Trump of the seriousness of the decision and to return to “rules-based order of trade”.“We have a compelling case, to have a carve-out, even if you take away the insanity of these tariffs as a whole because of our relationship andthe cheque we just dropped for submarines with the United States,” he told Weekend Today.Explore more on these topicsAustralian foreign policyAustralian politicsDonald TrumpChinaAnthony AlbanesePete HegsethAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

She died at the scene.Two other children, aged one and two, were also at the property at the time, but neither was injured.Both are in the care of their father.A GoFundMe set up for Sophia Rose’s father and siblings has so far raised $55,000.Family friend Connor Thompson, who has organised the fundraiser, remembered Sophia Rose as a sweet child with an infectious laugh that could light up the room.“Her smile was like a ray of sunshine and her heart was as pure of gold,” the fundraiser said.“Though her time here was short, the love she gave and the joy she shared will stay with us forever.”In Australia, the crisis support serviceLifelineis 13 11 14.

Niamh said she believed this was a reference to her participation in the“Mahmoud’s Hall” occupation of the Arts West building, a demonstration that led to the university agreeing to additional disclosures about its research project grant arrangements.2:47Australian students on why they've joined the pro-Palestinian protest movement – videoNiamh appeared to have been identified as being involved in the protest in part by the university tracking her location on campus through her wifi login, a tool that has beenthe subject of an investigationby the office of the Victorian information commissioner.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotion‘A vital moment’: Australian pro-Palestine campus protesters vow to stay on as tensions brewRead moreShe said she believed the activists had been “prejudged” by the university council, beginning with the then vice-chancellor, Duncan Maskell, circulatinga university-wide email the day after the protestcharacterising it as “an attempt to harass and intimidate” the academic.Maskell’s email was criticisedin an open letter signed by 174 university staff members, which said the comments risked impeding procedural fairness and “enabled the action to be incorrectly framed by major media outlets as antisemitic”.Maskell did not respond to the open letter.In May last year he implemented new university rules banning “protest that is not peaceful” and prohibiting protesters who were not university staff or students from entering university grounds.On 3 March his successor as vice-chancellor, Emma Johnston, implementedanother suite of rules against protests, including that they may not be held indoors and must not obstruct entries or exits of university buildings. The rules would apply to students and staff and also to “individual forms of action”.The student union and the National Tertiary Education Union have called the new rules “an authoritarian approach” that erroneously conflates staff and student discomfort with lack of safety. The Human Rights Law Centre, Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International haveurged the universityto rescind them.Niamh said Johnston’s rules were “particularly disturbing and hypocritical” and “a massive betrayal of the values and history of student unionism” given Johnston’s own history as the university’s student union president in the 1990s, when she advocated for direct action protests including sit-ins.“Her words are irreconcilable with her actions when some of the worst anti-protest rules are being pushed through under her leadership,” Niamh said.“I would love to see the university take more of an approach of wanting to sit down with their students and wanting to really hear from where their students are coming from and why students around the world feel this urgent moral necessity to stand against … the horrible atrocities we’re witnessing in Gaza as well as the West Bank and all of occupied Palestine,” she said.A spokesperson for the University of Melbourne said it would not comment on individual cases “to protect the integrity of our disciplinary processes’”.“The University of Melbourne has followed its disciplinary processes in accordance with University policy in response to an incident that took place in October 2024,” the spokesperson said.“This process has not concluded. The University is communicating directly with individuals involved in disciplinary proceedings. Students have the right to appeal decisions made through the University’s disciplinary processes.”Last year an Australian National University studentwho was expelledand a Deakin University studentwho was suspendedfor Palestine-related activism had those decisions overturned on appeal.*Name has been changedExplore more on these topicsAustralian universitiesProtestMelbourneVictoriaAustralian educationActivismIsrael-Gaza warnewsShareReuse this content"

The cordon will remain in place overnight. A white Irish adult male is deceased at the scene.“The army explosive ordnance disposal (EOD) team has been requested to attend.”Ireland’s deputy leader, Simon Harris, said he was “deeply concerned”, adding: “I understand a young child has been hurt and I join with people across our country in thinking of them and their family tonight.“I am also thinking of all those who witnessed this situation and the awful shock and upset it must have caused them. I know their families and communities will rally to support them. I am grateful to our emergency services for their work and response.”O’Callaghan said: “This was a really shocking incident. My thoughts are with everyone affected by the shooting and the community and families impacted, including those working at the scene.“This is something we never want or expect to happen in our communities. Gun violence is very rare in Ireland, and I am determined that will remain the case. The area in Carlow is safe. “We must now allow An Garda Síochána to investigate this incident fully.”A local Fine Gael councillor, Fergal Browne, said: “People were obviously terrified, a bank holiday Sunday, going into town to do their shopping. People ran from the centre crying and upset.“There was a bunch of foreign students in the area, who could not believe they were caught up in the middle of all of it.“It’s a busy spot. We launched a photographic exhibition there on Friday night in the shopping centre.”Browne added: “There is lots of activity in the centre between people shopping and people working there, exhibitions. It’s very upsetting for everyone who was involved in it or who witnessed it. I was down there in the last hour and it seems to have calmed down a good bit now.”Browne said he wanted to thank all the emergency services that had attended the scene.Explore more on these topicsIrelandEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Both men died at the scene.Javier Salas, the deputy government delegate in Málaga, said both victims were believed to be Scottish nationals. Specialist officers from the Guardia Civil’s violent crime unit are reportedly leading the investigation.Monaghans Irish bar, which sits on the seafront, is a well-known pub popular with British tourists and expats. Witnesses said it was busy on Saturday night with football fans watching the Champions League final.A resident told local paper Málaga Hoy: “I thought they were going to kill me too. I thought I was hearing fireworks at first but then saw the noise was coming from someone firing a gun.”A Chinese expat who owns a shop next to the bar said: “I heard a noise coming from next door. I looked out and saw a man pointing at something and shooting.”A worker at a nearby beach bar and restaurant also recounted how families with children took refuge inside after the shooting started. “I didn’t see anything because we focused on crouching down and staying safe, but it was a very frightening experience. Obviously all the customers we had left as soon as it was safe to do so.”A spokesperson for the Foreign Office said it had not been approached for consular assistance but that its staff stood ready to support any British nationals in need.

The Tu-95 was originally developed to carry nuclear bombs and now launches cruise missiles.Several Russian and Ukrainian media outlets reported that Ukraine carried out the operation by launching drones from lorries parked near military airfields deep inside Russia.Ukrainian officials told the media that the operation – codename “Spiderweb” – had been in preparation for more than 18 months. The drones were first smuggled into Russia and later concealed under the roofs of small wooden sheds which were loaded on to trucks and driven to the perimeter of the airbases. The roof panels of the sheds were lifted off by a remotely activated mechanism, allowing the drones to fly out and begin their attack, the official said.View image in fullscreenA picture purporting to show the sheds the drones were hidden in.Photograph: Ukraine’s security serviceMedia reports said Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, had personally overseen the sophisticated operation.On Sunday evening he thanked everyone involved, adding: “We had been preparing the operation for more than a year and a half. Planning, organisation, all the details were perfectly prepared. I can say for sure that this is a completely unique operation.”He said that the office of Ukraine’s operation in Russia had been located “right next to the FSB office in one of (Russia’s) regions”.“In total, 117 drones were used in the operation. And a corresponding number of drone operators were working,” he said. “Thirty-four per cent of the strategic cruise missile carriers at the airfields were hit. Our people were operating in different Russian regions – in three time zones. And our people were withdrawn from the territory of Russia on the eve of the operation, and now they are safe – those who helped us.”Photographs from Ukrainian security officials showed dozens of short-range quadcopter drones piled up in an industrial facility. Other images showed the wooden sheds with their metal roofing panels removed, and the drones sitting in the cavities between roof beams.A separate video posted on Russian Telegram channels appeared to show matching sheds on the back of a truck with the roof panels lying on the ground and at least two drones rising out of the top of the sheds and flying off.Mash, a Telegram channel with links to Russia’s security services,published footagethat appeared to show men in Siberia’s Irkutsk region climbing on to one of the lorries in an attempt to prevent drones from launching.View image in fullscreenThe drones supposedly used in the attack.Photograph: Ukraine’s security serviceIn one clip,filmed at the burning airbase in Olenegorskin the Murmansk region, a Russian service person is heard saying: “It’s fucked here,” as several bombers burn in the background.Since the full-scale invasion began in February 2022, Ukraine has been chronically outgunned by Russia in terms of military firepower. But it has developed a nimble and sizeable fleet of attack drones used to strike Russia’s army and energy infrastructure.The Belaya airbase targeted on Sunday in Irkutsk oblast is more than 2,500 miles (4,000km) from Ukraine.The Russian defence ministry confirmed that several of its military aircraft “caught fire” in the attack in the regions of Murmansk and Irkutsk. It added that there were no casualties and that several “participants” had been arrested.In March, Ukraine said it had developed a new drone with a range of 3,000km, without providing further details.Earlier on Sunday, Russian investigators said they believed “explosions” had causedtwo bridges in the border regions of Kursk and Bryansk to collapseovernight, derailing trains and killing at least seven people and injuring dozens. No one has claimed responsibility.Russian investigators were investigating the bridge blasts as “acts of terrorism”, according to state media. The Kremlin said the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, had been briefed throughout the night.Separately, tracks on the Unecha-Zhecha section of railway in Russia’s Bryansk region were damaged without casualties, the national operator, Russian Railways, said.Russia has been hit by dozens of sabotage attacks since Moscow launched its offensive against Ukraine in 2022, many targeting its vast railway network. Kyiv says railways are targeted because they transport troops and weaponry.Russian-controlled territory and most recent Russian advances mapMeanwhile, the Ukrainian air force said Russia had launched 472 drones overnight, the highest nightly total of the war so far, as well as seven missiles. Ukraine’s army said at least 12 Ukrainian service members were killed and more than 60 were injured in a Russian missile strike on an army training unit.Ukraine had previously refused to commit to attending a new round of direct talks in Turkey but on Sunday Zelenskyy said a delegation led by his defence minister, Rustem Umerov, would be in Istanbul. “I have also defined our position before the Monday meeting in Istanbul,” which includes priorities to reach “a complete and unconditional ceasefire” and the return of prisoners and abducted children, Zelenskyy said on social media.Ukraine war briefing: New air assault on KyivRead moreThe US president, Donald Trump, has put pressure on both sides to end the war and threatened to walk away if they do not, potentially leaving Kyiv entirely dependent on European aid.Reuters reported Ukrainian negotiators in Istanbul would present a proposed plan for reaching a lasting peace settlement, with the current frontline as the starting point for negotiations about territory.Citing a copy of the document laying out the Ukrainian position, it said there would be no future restrictions on Ukraine’s military strength, no international recognition of Russian sovereignty over parts of Ukraine taken by Moscow’s forces, and reparations for Ukraine.Last year, Putin set out his opening terms for an immediate end to the war, demanding Ukraine drop its Nato membership ambitions and withdraw all of its troops from all four Ukrainian regions claimed and mostly controlled by Russia.With Reuters and Agence France-PresseExplore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

My brother went with two of his friends. One of them was critically injured in the head, the other was killed, and my brother was shot in the back.”“He was transported to the hospital by a donkey cart – no ambulances can reach the area, and there were dozens of injured and dead,” Naja added. “We saw him placed on the ground. There were no available beds due to the large number of casualties and dead arriving from the same location. The scenes were horrific – people missing limbs, hands or legs, others decapitated, or with open abdomens.”Media reports said dozens of people were being treated at the hospital after the latest incident at thecontroversial site in Rafah. Officials at the field hospital did not say who opened fire but added that another 175 people were wounded.View image in fullscreenBodies of Palestinians being brought to Nasser hospital after Israeli soldiers opened fire on people trying to reach aid points.Photograph: Abdallah F.s. Alattar/ Anadolu/Getty ImagesThe International Committee of the Red Cross said (ICRC) its field hospital in Rafah received a “mass casualty influx” of 179 people, 21 of whom were declared dead upon arrival. “All patients said they had been trying to reach an aid distribution site,” the ICRC added, describing it as “the highest number of weapon-wounded in a single incident since the establishment of the field hospital over a year ago”.Local health authorities said at least 31 of the dead were taken to Nasser hospital.The Red Crescent also reported a further 14 Palestinians were injured near a separate aid distribution site in central Gaza.The Israeli forces denied “firing at civilians”. However, an Israel Defense Forces official admitted that Israeli soldiers fired “warning shots toward several suspects who advanced toward the troops on Saturday”, near the aid distribution site, without specifying who the suspects were.The Israeli-backed aid foundation claimed that it delivered aid “without incident” early on Sunday and has denied previous accounts of gunfire around its sites, which are in Israeli military zones where independent access is limited.US distances itself from Gaza food delivery group amid questions over leadership and fundingRead moreIsraeli forces had given orders that no one should approach the hub before 6am local time. Multiple witnesses said people had begun lining up from 5am, and dozens were said to have surged forward and started running towards it. When the crowds reached the Flag Roundabout, about 0.6 miles (1km) away, Israeli forces started shooting at the crowd, witnesses said.“I went with my brother Shuhada to get food for our children,” Hani Baraka, 43, said. ‘‘The area was very crowded. At the start, a quadcopter drone came and gave orders, saying it was still too early to open the gates and that they would open them at 6am. It seems people moved forward earlier than the time set by the army. The soldiers panicked and began firing at the crowd. My brother was shot in the head and killed instantly.”“On its way back, the drone hit a hanging wire and fell to the ground,” Baraka added. “People rushed toward it, and then the Israeli soldiers opened fire on us. Army snipers surrounded the area and started shooting at the crowd.”The GHF has hired private security firms, but according to witnesses, the private contractors did not open fire on the crowd.“Inside the gate, there were armed American soldiers, but they did not fire at us,” Baraka said. “They only threw plastic stun grenades in the square to scare people and clear the area once the aid ran out.”Reuters footage showed ambulance vehicles carrying injured people to Nasser hospital. Other clips emerged showing people running and ducking, with apparent gunfire audible in the background. One piece of footage seems to have been filmed in the Salah al-Din Road, just south of an aid distribution site in the Netzarim corridor.Doctors at Nasser hospital reported chaotic scenes, with dozens of bodies being brought in.View image in fullscreenBodies of Palestinians arrive at Nasser hospital.Photograph: Abed Rahim Khatib/ Anadolu/Getty Images“The situation in the hospital is catastrophic, due to the massacre of the hungry in Rafah city, near the aid distribution centre,” said Dr Marwan al-Hams, 53, a medic in the emergency department at Nasser hospital. “Most injuries were shot in the upper parts of the body – the head, chest, and abdomen – as the Israeli army was reportedly firing from high altitudes using aircraft or quadcopters. A witness on the scene said that shots were also fired from a crane and from tanks.”The hub is part of a controversial new aid system.On 28 May,Hamas accused Israel of killing at least three Palestiniansand wounding 46 near one of the GHF’s distribution sites, an accusation the group denied. The Israeli military said its troops fired warning shots in the area outside the compound to re-establish control as thousands of Palestinians rushed to an aid distribution site.Israelimposed a blockade on all suppliesin March, saying Hamas was seizing deliveries for its fighters, which the group denies. Earlier this month, a global hunger monitor said half a million people in the strip faced starvation.TheIPC estimatedthat nearly 71,000 children under the age of five were expected to be “acutely malnourished”, with 14,100 cases expected to be severe in the next 11 months.The UN and other humanitarian organisations have rejected the new system for food distribution, saying it would not be able to meet the needs of Gaza’s 2.3 million people and allowed Israel to use food as a weapon to control the population.The latest incident took place as Hamas and Israel exchanged blame over a faltering effort to secure a ceasefire.Hamas said on Saturdayit was seeking amendments to a US-backed ceasefire proposal, but Donald Trump’s envoy Steve Witkoff rejected the group’s response as “totally unacceptable”.Reuters and Associated Press contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warGazaIsraelMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesnewsShareReuse this content"

He had just returned home after accompanying his wife Alaa, a paediatrician at the Nasser medical complex, to work when the building was struck. He had initially survived alongside his son Adam, 11, who is still in hospital.Even by the terrible standards of theGazaconflict, their deaths had shocked the international community.Footage shared by the director of Gaza’s health ministry and verified by the Guardian showed the burnt, dismembered bodies of Najjar’s children being pulled from the rubble of their house near a petrol station as flames engulfed what remained of the family’s home.Alaa had received the bodies while she was still at work. Sources at the Nasser hospital who transferred the children’s bodies one by one to the morgue said their mother was not able to identify them, so bad were the burns.One afternoon in Gaza, two family tragedies: the childhoods cut short by Israeli airstrikesRead moreDoctors told the Guardian her husband was suffering from severe injuries – brain damage and fractures caused by shrapnel, along with shrapnel wounds and fractures in the chest. He was placed on a ventilator and fitted with medical tubes.On Sunday, they said, he passed away from the severe wounds sustained in the attack.Following an appeal issued by Adam’s uncle, Ali al-Najjar, 50, and reported by the Italian newspaper La Repubblica, Italy’s foreign minister, Antonio Tajani,said the country was ready to receive Adamfor medical care and was working to arrange his evacuation on 11 June.Italy had expressed a willingness to evacuate both the father and mother as well, but due to Najjar’s critical condition, transferring him out of Gaza was deemed too dangerous. His wife had agreed for their son, Adam, to be taken to Italy with an aunt and three cousins, but said she would remain by her husband’s side.After Najjar’s death, sources within the Italian foreign ministry have indicated that his wife may also be evacuated to Italy.Explore more on these topicsGazaPalestinian territoriesIsrael-Gaza warIsraelMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Trusts have already been ordered to reduce bank use by at least 10%.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It urges the secretary of state for defence, John Healey, to start an inquiry “without further delay”, giving him 14 days to respond.Last week the Guardian reported the families’ demand, in an open letter to the government, for thefull release of archive documentsthat have been locked away until 2094 by the MoD.

In our view, a public inquiry is key.”Andy Tobias, who was eight when his father, Lt Col John Tobias, 41, was killed, said: “It’s clear to me that a complete lack of duty of care was given to those passengers because they got on a Chinook that wasn’t fit for flight.“And really, the government need to show their duty of candour and really be open and transparent about what’s in those documents and give us the opportunity to really understand anything that’s in them that could give us more answers about what happened.”On Sunday, families attended a private commemoration at the National Memorial Arboretum in Staffordshire. Describing the crash as “a tragic accident”, an MoD spokesperson previously said: “Our thoughts and sympathies remain with the families, friends and colleagues of all those who died.”Explore more on these topicsMinistry of DefenceRoyal Air ForceScotlandMilitarynewsShareReuse this content"

Operation Spider’s Web was in preparation for 18 months, with relatively cheap drones targeting strategic Russian aviation.It is also expected to conclude:The UK will commit to building 12 nuclear-powered attack submarines at Barrow in Cumbria and Raynesway, Derby, as part of the three-country Aukus programme with the US and Australia. The first submarines will launch in the late 2030s, replacing seven Astute-class submarines, tasked to operate around the world.A total of £15bn will be invested in modernising the production of nuclear weapons at Aldermaston in Berkshire, supporting more than 9,000 jobs as part of a programme to supply bombs for the Dreadnought submarines that will replace the ageing Vanguard boats that carry the Trident deterrent.That Russia poses an “immediate and pressing” danger posed by Russia while China is a “sophisticated and persistent challenge” to British interests. Iran and North Korea will be described as “regional disruptors” and potentially hostile to the UK, with each of the four showing growing signs of being willing to work together.A new volunteer-led Home Guard be created to help protect airports, communications nodes and other parts of Britain’s critical national infrastructure from drone and other surprise attacks, freeing up the time of soldiers and specialist police who guard such locations at present.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But engaging in “nuclear sharing” with the US would be complex, and would require sensitive negotiations with the Trump administration if it were the path chosen.In Europe, B61 bombs remain US property until there is a deemed to be war. At that point, because non-proliferation rules are then deemed not to apply, “the host country puts the weapons on their planes and sets off with them,” according to Dave Cullen, a nuclear expert at the Basic thinktank.Healey declined to comment on air-launched nuclear weapons on Sunday, and no announcement is expected on the issue shortly. The minister instead reiterated the value of Trident. “For over 70 years, our UK nuclear deterrent has been the ultimate guarantee of security in this country. It’s what Putin fears most,” he told the BBC.The defence review is not expected to announce any immediate increase in defence budgets, beyond a commitment to lift spending by about £5bn to 2.5% of GDP in 2027 and to 3% in the next parliament.But Starmer and other Nato leaders are expected to discuss and agree fresh spending targets at a summit in The Hague later this month, of about 5% of GDP, of which 3.5% will be on military spending and the rest on cyberdefence and other infrastructure.Explore more on these topicsDefence policyMilitaryLabourJohn HealeynewsShareReuse this content"

Hill grew up in County Durham, but moved to forge a successful career as a national security analyst in the US, mindful of her father’s advice about where she had grown up: “There is nothing for you here.”Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and Britain’s support to help Kyiv defend itself have pushed the UK to seek to revive forms of manufacturing that the long period of peace after the cold war had made obsolete.Last year, an agreement with Germany paved the way for a revival of artillery barrel manufacturing at a site in Telford, a decade after it had been abandoned. And ahead of Monday’s strategic defence review, the government again focused on a long-term industrial commitment, this time to eventually build a fleet of Aukus nuclear powered attack submarines, starting in the late 2030s. Assembled in Barrow, the effort would support 30,000 jobs, the MoD said.Such a longer-term focus may also help conceal the relative shortage of money in the short term for defence. The current commitment to lift defence spending to 2.5% of GDP in 2027 may easily be swallowed up in funding existing commitments and overspends.Fresh spending on armaments is of course hardly neutral – it depends entirely on what the weapons are intended to be used for. And while there may be strong public support for Ukraine, in other cases the export of arms can be controversial.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Astudy by Greenpeacelooking at the economies of Germany, Italy and Spain concluded that investing in healthcare, education or green technologies creates more jobs and growth than investing in defence.A more honest position, said Sam Perlo-Freeman of Campaign Against Arms Trade, would be to “separate security arguments from economic arguments” and seek to justify military investment only the basis of the threat perceived. But it is not one that politicians are likely to make when it is possible to point to new factories being built and new jobs created as a result of defence spending.Explore more on these topicsDefence policyMilitaryLabourAidTax and spendingEconomic policyEconomicsnewsShareReuse this content"

He said the department received calls at about 1.26pm local time of a man with a weapon near a downtown courthouse and that people were being set on fire.When police responded, they found people with injuries consistent with burns.

Local and regional directors were to inform Washington “as soon as possible” when situations exist “that have the potential for negative national exposure”.In an email statement, the VA press secretary Peter Kasperowicz said the agency’s policy on publications and public comments “simply requires VA employees to properly coordinate with public affairs staff prior to speaking with the media. Virtually every organization both inside and outside government has similar policies.”The policy “has been in place for several years across both Democrat and Republican administrations”, he said.Ganapathiraju told the Guardian that the article was in full compliance with the VA regulations, which state that employees are encouraged to publish in “peer-reviewed, professional or scholarly journals”. Coordination with public affairs officers is encouraged, but not required, when sharing personal or academic opinions, the rules say.Ganapathiraju said neither he nor his co-author had yet faced punishment. “We have received emails and messages from other VAs across the country (including doctors, department chiefs, chief of medicines, and chief of staff) supporting our article,” he wrote in an email. “No communication from our local VA or from National.”Still, VA workers and veterans advocates say Friday’s warnings fit a pattern of censorship by the Trump administration, which critics say is waging a “war on science”. Since taking office, Trump administration officials have cancelled billions of dollars in grants funding medical research at the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation. Nearly 2,000 leading scientists, including dozens of Nobel Prize winners,signed an open letterreleased in April saying science was being “decimated” by cuts to research and a growing “climate of fear” that put independent research at risk.In his statement, the VA’s Kasperowicz said it is “absurd” to suggest that enforcing the agency’s media policy is part of a “war on science”.Trump issued an executive order on 23 May titled “Restoring Gold Standard Science”. It accused his predecessor, Joe Biden, of misusing scientific evidence when crafting policies on climate change, public health during the Covid-19 pandemic and other issues. Thousands of academicssigned a new open letterthat protested the move, arguing it opens the door to political interference.On 28 May, the secretary of health and human services, Robert F Kennedy Jr, said he wasconsidering barringgovernment scientists from publishing in top journals, including the Journal of the American Medical Association, the Lancet and the New England Journal of Medicine, calling these publications “corrupt”.The Department of Veterans Affairs has long been one of the nation’s most important centers of medical research. Funded by Congress with nearly $1bn annually, VA scientists operate at 102 research sites and are engaged in 7,300 ongoing projects, while publishing more than 10,000 papers in scientific journals last year.VA scientistsinventedthe nicotine patch and the pacemaker and developed the CT scan. The agency runs the National Center for Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, which has pioneered mental health treatments that benefit not only veterans but also rape victims and survivors of natural disasters and other violent crimes.Harold Kudler, a psychiatrist and researcher who served as the national mental health policy lead for the VA under the Obama and first Trump administrations, said the rebuke to the pulmonologists’ article was “powerful in its impact and frightening in the threat it represents”.It was “another attack on freedom of speech”, he said. “Veterans will suffer because of it. Plus, all research programs will take note.”Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS politicsUS militarynewsShareReuse this content"

The list prompted a response from the National Sheriffs’ Association, which represents more than 3,000 elected sheriffs across the country and generally supports federalimmigrationenforcement.Sheriff Kieran Donahue, president of the association, said in a statement on Saturday that DHS published “a list of alleged noncompliant sheriffs in a manner that lacks transparency and accountability”. Donahue said the list was created without input from sheriffs and “violated the core principles of trust, cooperation, and partnership with fellow law enforcement”.Donald Trump had called for his administration to tally apparent sanctuary jurisdictions, in a late April executive order, saying the lack of cooperation amounted to “a lawless insurrection”.The DHS website listing the jurisdictions was offline on Sunday, an issue that Fox News host Maria Bartiromo raised with the homeland security secretary,Kristi Noem, on the talk show Sunday Morning Futures.“I saw that there was a list produced,” Bartiromo said. “Now, the list I don’t see anymore in the media. Do you have a list of the sanctuary cities that are actually hiding illegals right now?”Noem did not acknowledge the list being taken offline but said some localities had bristled.“Some of the cities have pushed back,” Noem said. “They think because they don’t have one law or another on the books that they don’t qualify, but they do qualify. They are giving sanctuary to criminals.”Leaders of some cities publicly questioned the sanctuary label this week, including jurisdictions in southern California, Colorado and Massachusetts.San Diego city attorney Heather Ferbert told local outlets that San Diego – named on the DHS list – had never adopted a sanctuary policy and that the move appeared to be politically motivated.“We suspect this is going to be used as additional threats and fear tactics to threaten federal funding that the city relies on,” she said.Immigrant advocates and some Democrats say sanctuary policies help build trust between immigrant communities and law enforcement so that residents will be more likely to report crimes.At a hearing before a US House of Representatives committee in March, mayors from Boston, Chicago, Denver and New York City, which vote majority Democrat, said sanctuary policies made their cities safer and that they would always honor criminal arrest warrants.Noem, who shares Trump’s hardline anti-immigration views, said the department would continue to use the sanctuary tally. DHS did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The internet archive website Wayback Machine showed the list still online on Saturday.Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationTrump administrationKristi NoemUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

And whilethose cuts, cited bythe departingMusk as beingworth $175bn, are tinycomparedwith the trillion or more he forecast, Vought said OMB was only going to submit about $9.4bn to Congress this week for sign-off. That amount is understood to mostly cover the crushing of theUSAID agencyand cuts to public broadcasting, which have prompted outrageand lawsuits.Leaders of Congress fromboth partieshave pressed for the Trump administration to send details of all the cuts for its approval. “Will you?” Bash asked Vought.“We might,” Vought said, adding that the rest of the Doge cuts may not need official congressional approval.As one of the architects ofProject 2025, the rightwing initiative created to guide the second Trump administration, Vought ison a questto dismantle the federal workforce and consolidate power for the US president, andto continuethe Doge cuts.Vought said that one of the executive tools the administration has is the use of “impoundment”, which involves the White House withholding specific funds allocated by Congress. Since the 1970s, a law has limited the presidency from engaging in impoundment – typically requiring the executive branch to implement what Congress signed into law.Bash said: “I know you don’t believe that that is constitutional, so are you just doing this in order to getthe supreme courtto rule that unconstitutional?”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Just thispast weekinDenmark, the retirement age for collecting a government pension was increased to 70 years old, an issue that has caused much debate in that country. Here in the US, questions have been raised aboutJoe Biden’smental acuitywhile he was still in office. Warren Buffett announcedhis retirementat the age of 94 from Berkshire Hathaway.Donald Trump’s behavior, at the age of 78, continues toraise concern, if not alarm.When are people too old to do their jobs?Recentregulations are encouragingworkers to stay on the job by increasing the age for when people are required to start cashing out their 401(k) plans from 70 1/2 years to 75 years by 2033. However, arecent studyfound that more than half of workers over the age of 50 have been pushed out of jobs before they would have retired willingly. US law prohibits forced retirement, but some well-known companies – like General Electric, Exxon, Intel and Apple – have age-based restrictions for their senior executives and board members.Yet, according to arecent reportfrom the Federal Reserve, more than half of small businesses are owned by people over the age of 55, including 70% of firms with more than 50 employees. Should they still be in charge?It’s a growing concern because the population of old people is growing. In the US, thenumber of peopleover the age of 65 was about 9% of the total population in 1960. Today it’s closer to 18% and by 2054, 84 million adults ages 65 and olderwill make upan estimated 23% of the population.Life expectancywas less than 70 back in 1960. Now it’s closing in on 80. People are living longer and working longer. We all know people in their 80s who are sharper than those who are half their age.How old is too old?Clearly you can’t assign an arbitrary number that defines old age. Mick Jagger is 81. Bruce Springsteen is 75. Paul McCartney is 82. They’re all still performing in front of countless fans. Tom Cruise – age 62 – is still jumping out of planes. Cher, 78, recently released a holiday album. Richard Branson, 74, continues to command the Virgin empire. Say what you want about Trump, but even at 78, he’s running around like someone half his age.But do we really want a 78-year-old running the country? Or piloting a commercial jet? Or performing open-heart surgery? Should someone that old be putting out fires, fixing roofs, driving trucks, working in a steel foundry, herding cattle? Probably not. In fact, when someone hits a certain age, everything needs to be re-evaluated.How do I stay healthy in my 60s?Read moreWhat age? 60.A2023 studyfound that almost half of the Fortune 500 were run by people over the age of 60. However, only 28 companies were still being run by a CEO over the age of 70. Something happens during that time, and a recent study from Stanford University may provide the clue.Accordingto that research, which tracked thousands of molecules in people aged 25 to 75, two major waves of age-related changes were detected at around ages 44 and again at 60, which helps explain why spikes in certain health issues including musculoskeletal problems and cardiovascular disease occur. This may account for the “sudden accumulation of wrinkles, aches and pains or a general sensation of having grown older almost overnight”. It’s not gradual. It’s a burst. And while the study focused on physical effects, I believe there’s something else going on once someone hits the age of 60: a loss of energy.I have a friend in his early 60s who used to run a bar in downtown Philadelphia and now works as a manager at a manufacturing firm. I asked him if he had any interest in running a bar in the future. “Are you kidding?” he said to me. “I just don’t have the energy. I just want to play a little golf and spend time with my grandkids.”That sums it up. Most people lose energy when they hit their 60s. Of course, we’re still interested in the world. But work has become less of a priority. We prefer to do other, more fun things in the remaining years of our lives. We tire a little more quickly. We go to bed earlier. We move a little more slowly. I was recently offered the opportunity to buy a competitor’s business and I declined. Sounded interesting but, like my friend, I just couldn’t imagine mustering the energy needed to make such a transaction successful. The thought exhausted me. It still does!Explore more on these topicsUS small businessAgeingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It has also fuelled a renewed interest in the global nuclear power renaissance already under way.Despite long-held environmental concerns about nuclear power generation, political leaders across the globe are increasingly looking to lift restrictions on nuclear reactors or invest billions in new projects to keep pace with the fast-rising demand for low-carbon energy, which is expected to accelerateas AI datacentres grow.InSpain, the blackout has intensified an ongoing debate over the government’s plans to phase out the country’s remaining seven nuclear reactors by 2035. Support for the low-carbon energy source has re-emerged hand-in-hand with criticism of renewable energy, and its potential role in the outage.Spain’s power grid relied on renewable energy for about 70% of its power at the time of the blackout, which experts believe may have made it more difficult for the energy system operator to keep the grid’s frequency stable.View image in fullscreenFans at the Madrid Open tennis tournament last month after matches were suspended because of the power outage.Photograph: Violeta Santos Moura/ReutersThe suggestion was vehemently denied by Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, in the country’s parliament. Just hours after the blackout he said: “There was no problem caused by an excess of renewable energy. Those who link this incident to the lack of nuclear energy are either lying or revealing their ignorance.”But even before the Iberian peninsula was plunged into chaos, critics of the government’s anti-nuclear stance had raised their concerns. A few weeks before the blackout, the chair of the renewable energy company Iberdrola, which owns a small stake in the country’s nuclear fleet, warned Spain against plans to shut all seven of its nuclear power plants by 2035.Ignacio Galán predicted that Spain could see its electricity prices jump by a quarter and get a less reliable system if Madrid followed the example of Germany, which began to close its nuclear reactors following the Fukushima nuclear disaster in 2011 andcompleted the phase-out in 2023.Days later Sama Bilbao y León, director-general of the World Nuclear Association, told a conference in Madrid that she was “concerned about Spain’s economic future without nuclear energy” because its economic progress would rely on “abundant, clean, and affordable energy, available every day, all year round”.In Germany the hardline stance against nuclear power is already softening. Chancellor Friedrich Merz, who came to power in February, has criticised the previous government for shutting Germany’s last three nuclear power stations in the midst of Europe’s energy cost crisis and promised to explore whether it is possible to resurrect the plants.Merz is not expected to back a return to new conventional nuclear power projects in Germany but he has vowed to invest in new technologies: such as small modular reactors (SMRs) and nuclear fusion. The Swiss government has also said it will lift the country’s ban on the construction of new nuclear power projects, which has been in place since 1 January 2018, to pursue SMR projects.The tide against nuclear power is turning in countries beyond Europe too.Later this summer Taiwan is expected to vote on whether to restart a nuclear reactor which shut just last week amid concerns on the island about the rising electricity demand of some of the world’s biggest chipmakers which are based there, and about energy security in the event of a military blockade by China.The concerns about a looming surge in power demand driven by tech giants and the desire for secure, homegrown low-carbon energy sources are common in countries across the globe. This trend is key to the renewed interest in nuclear power.In the US, the notorious Three Mile Island site in Pennsylvaniawill restart for the first time in five yearsafter its owners struck a 20-year deal to power Microsoft’s energy-hungry AI datacentres. Tech companies including Amazon, Meta and Apple are all expected to consume vastamounts of energyto power the boom in AI, and nuclear has emerged as an increasingly popular option given its steady stream of 24/7 power generation.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The move was welcomed by nuclear proponents as a step towards helping to lower emissions in the US while supporting Big Tech.“Several big tech companies looking for low carbon, round-the-clock energy signed contracts for new nuclear capacity in the last year, and there could be more such deals ahead,” predicted the US investment bank Goldman Sachs earlier this year.“The proliferation of AI data centers has boosted investor confidence in future growth in electricity demand at the same time as big tech companies are looking for low-carbon reliable energy. This is leading to the de-mothballing of recently retired nuclear generators, as well as consideration for new larger-scale reactors,” it added.View image in fullscreenThe Three Mile Island nuclear site in 2011.Photograph: Bradley C Bower/APThe growing demand for electricity may have piqued the interest of global government in nuclear power, but it is the breakthrough in new nuclear technologies which promises a new dawn for the industry. Whereas full-scale nuclear projects are notorious for spiralling budgets and delays, SMRs promise quicker, cheaper construction because the component parts can be built in a factory and assembled on site. But the technology has not been proven commercially.Last year Google became the first company to ink an agreement to purchase nuclear energy from small modular reactors (SMRs), which are being developed by Kairos Power in the US. Small modular reactors are also being pursued by the US, South Korea, China, Russia, and Canada. The latter approved the construction of the first mini-nuclear reactor in the West earlier this month which is expected to begin operating by 2029.In the UK, Keir Starmer unveiled plans for a historic expansion in nuclear power across England and Wales shortly after calling for tech companies to work alongside the government to build small modular reactors (SMRs) to power energy intensive AI datacentres across Britain. He said that he anticipated smaller reactors could begin operating in 2032 and become commonplace across Britain.The nuclear industry’s detractors have played down the potential for SMRs to prove a gamechanger for nuclear energy. Dr Doug Parr, the chief scientist and a director at Greenpeace UK, said the Labour government had “swallowed nuclear industry spin whole, which is courageous – or stupid – given that not a single one has been built, and with the nuclear industry’s record of being over time and over budget unmatched by any other sector.”He added: “As for the unsolved problem of nuclear waste management, government don’t see the need to mention it at all.”Nuclear powerhas seen false dawns before, but the industry believes the next decade could hold the key to its renaissance.Explore more on these topicsNuclear powerEnergyNuclear wasteSpainEuropeRenewable energyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The Spaniard flung his racket and, as it flipped through the air, the strings somehow not only made contact with the ballbut sent it back over the net.Iga Swiatek stages stunning comeback to reach French Open quarter-finalsRead moreInitially, the defending champion was awarded the point. But he told the chair umpire that he had broken the rules because he wasn’t holding his racket when it touched the ball. The point went to Shelton, and the Court Philippe-Chatrier crowd gave Alcaraz a round of applause.The moment came at what could have been a critical moment in the match, which Alcaraz won 7-6, 6-3, 4-6, 6-4. Instead of leading 40-30 on his serve, Alcaraz was now down 30-40, giving his American opponent his first break point of the match. But Alcaraz saved that one – and five others in that 20-point game – along the way to taking a two-set lead.The 13th-seeded Shelton, twice a semi-finalist at majors, delivered serves at up to 143 mph and forehands at up to 116 mph. Alcaraz, already a four-time Grand Slam champion, showed off his own power through the match.“We entertained the people. He is a really powerful player. He can make any shot. I think we played really great tennis. Drops, coming to the net, big shots, and we stayed there in the whole match,” Alcaraz said after the match. “For me, it is great having Ben around, a great energy for tennis and for the people. I love watching him play.”It was tighter than the score might indicate: Shelton had several opportunities to take the first-set tiebreaker. But Alcaraz – who meets another American, Tommy Paul, in the quarter-finals on Tuesday – converted his second set point, closing a 15-stroke exchange with a down-the-line forehand that drew a mistake from Shelton.The third set went to Shelton when Alcaraz put a forehand into the net, and the big-swinging American punched the air, then his chest, and screamed: “Let’s go, baby! Come on!” The fourth swung Alcaraz’s way when he used a drop shot winner to set up a break point that he claimed for a 2-1 edge and, after three hours and 19 minutes, he was able to finish off an 11th consecutive win at Roland-Garros.Earlier on Sunday, Paul beat Alexei Popyrin, 6-3, 6-3, 6-3 to become the first American man to reach theFrench Openquarters since Andre Agassi in 2003. He was joined soon afterwards by his compatriot Frances Tiafoe, who beat Germany’s Daniel Altmaier in straights sets.Explore more on these topicsCarlos AlcarazFrench OpenFrench Open 2025TennisnewsShareReuse this content"

But the truth about this team – and Tom Thibodeau’s coaching – lies somewhere in the messy middle.The Knicks are out. They were eliminated by the Indiana Pacers for the second straight campaign, bowing out from the Eastern Conference finals in six games instead oflast year’s seven-game lossin the East semis. As the franchise’s best season in a generation comes to a close, the Knicks are trying to figure out how to feel.Knicks fandom is a hell of a place. Like the US political scene, it allows only two positions: praise or condemnation. Rational analysis rarely gains traction. Hyperbole prevails. It’s two sides of the same rotten coin.Relentless Pacers overrun Knicks to set up NBA finals showdown with ThunderRead moreThis season wasn’t a referendum on Thibodeau’s genius or ineptitude. It was something more complicated: a year of real progress, missed chances and rising expectations.One faction scapegoats Thibodeau without fully understanding their critiques. Some want him fired and replaced by Queens native Michael Malone – who wasjust fired himself. Others float assistants like Chris Quinn, but can’t articulate his philosophy beyond buzzwords. Often, these arguments mask a lack of understanding more than a coherent vision.Meanwhile, another camp defends Thibodeau’s every move, refusing to question his substitution patterns, rigid rotations or reliance on hard zone. Terms like “drop coverage” and “schemes” have become lazy shorthand for tribalized opinions.But just like the disappearing middle ground in national discourse, the truth lies somewhere in between.This was the Knicks’ first trip to the Eastern Conference finals in 25 years. That progress only happened because ownership finally stepped aside. Once James Dolan hired former agent Leon Rose and gave him room to operate, the team pivoted from star-chasing to smart-drafting, financially-disciplined and culture-building.Rose hired Thibodeau, his former client, to instill a ready-to-work mentality, then brought in Jalen Brunson, who emerged as a legitimate MVP candidate. Last summer Rose doubled down, cashing in draft capital and depth to reunite Brunson with Villanova teammate Mikal Bridges and adding Karl-Anthony Towns, OG Anunoby and Josh Hart.View image in fullscreenNew York fans watch the game as the Knicks fall further behind the Indiana Pacers during the second quarter on Saturday at a watch party held at Madison Square Garden.Photograph: Angelina Katsanis/Getty ImagesThat core delivered 51 wins and propelled New York to fifth in offensive rating (117.3) and eighth in net rating (4.0). They gutted out a first-round win over Detroit, then stunned top-seeded Boston in six behind a lethal Brunson-Towns pick-and-roll and a defense that played the gaps and switched more aggressively than at any point in the regular season.But against Indiana, their momentum stalled. The Pacers’ fast-paced 10-man rotation overwhelmed New York. They sent waves of defenders at Brunson, while Andrew Nembhard turned in the best defensive series of his career. Afterthat epic collapse in the series opener, Thibodeau had already shortened the rotation to seven for Game 2. He brought in Mitchell Robinson and Deuce McBride to shore up the pick-and-roll defense, where Brunson and Towns are most vulnerable.In Game 3, Thibodeau improvised, going nine-deep. Towns scored 20 of his 24 points in the fourth quarter to erase a 20-point deficit. Delon Wright and Landry Shamet were crucial on the defensive end. But in Game 4, neither Wright nor Shamet played in the third quarter, when Indiana seized control. They returned in the fourth, but Thibodeau closed with his usual starters, a group that was minus-20 in the series and minus-41 across the playoffs. Despite being plus-8 in Game 3, McBride, Wright and Shamet never shared the floor together in Game 4. Thibodeau’s most damaging choice may have been closing with Hart over McBride, who had barely guarded Tyrese Haliburton.Does Tom Thibodeau really run his players into the ground? The data says ... not exactlyRead moreIronically, Thibodeau made the same decisions in Game 5, but the Knicks won and critics went quiet. Wright and Shamet again sat the third quarter. Robinson again didn’t close. The hypocrisy of Thibs detractors borders on performative.The Knicks played from behind in nearly every playoff game except Game 5. Critics use this as justification to call for Thibodeau’s dismissal. But 17 turnovers in Games 4 and 6 – not a product of coaching – were decisive. The team’s 19.5 assists per game in the series weren’t on Thibodeau either. He ran a wide array of actions – horn sets, pin-downs, DHO, high pick-and-roll – but Indiana smothered secondary options, forcing Brunson and Towns into iso-heavy, low-efficiency looks.Brunson recorded just five assists to Towns across the entire series. That lack of connection played right into Rick Carlisle’s hands. His game plan – blitzing on switches, walling off Hart and Bridges in the lane – was clinical. Carlisle outcoached Thibodeau. But there’s no shame in that. Carlisle is a champion and one of the sharpest minds in the game.Every player in the Knicks’ main seven-man rotation had a fatal flaw: Bridges’ handle, Anunoby’s rebounding, Hart’s shooting, Robinson’s durability, McBride’s playmaking.Thibodeau isn’t a fraud or a genius. He gave fans what they asked for: deeper rotations, experimental lineups, extended minutes for the Towns-Robinson twin tower pairing. It still wasn’t enough. The Pacers were simply better.View image in fullscreenKnicks point guard Jalen Brunson, right, is defended by the Pacers’ Andrew Nembhard during Game 6.Photograph: Gregory Shamus/Getty ImagesNow it’s on Rose to retool the roster. That likely starts with keeping Robinson as the starting center and reconsidering Hart’s role. His lack of shooting limits five-out spacing and his defense, once a calling card, has regressed. He struggled consistently on switches and blew key rotations.Brunson and Towns remain elite offensively, but both are liabilities in transition and in ball-screen coverage. The Knicks’ regular-season defense was 2.8 points per 100 possessions better with Towns off the floor. In the playoffs, that gap narrowed –but problems remained. Thibodeau tried everything: starting Robinson, pre-switching with Anunoby, plugging in Hart. When Towns dropped, Indiana hit jumpers. When he switched, they beat him off the dribble. By Game 6, the starting unit had a minus-33 defensive rating. Poor communication plagued them all season.This wasn’t a collapse. It was a ceiling.The Knicks are no longer a punchline. They’re a real team with real stakes and real expectations. Every game in this series was winnable. They weren’t embarrassed, but they were outplayed.Visibility brings volume, however. The higher the stakes, the louder the takes. Knicks fandom now operates like a two-party system. Its future may depend on whether fan – and the franchise – can embrace complexity instead of shouting past each other.Explore more on these topicsNew York KnicksNBAIndiana PacersBasketballcommentShareReuse this content"

We are putting our lives on the line. We are fortunate the cars are as safe as they are these days but we shouldn’t take it for granted.“It felt very deliberate. It is something I have seen numerous times in sim racing and go-karts. I have never seen it in aFormula Onerace. It felt strange, bizarre and I really don’t know what was going through his mind.”Verstappen was told by his team to give a place back to Russell in the latter stages of the race. The pair had struck one another at turn one and the Dutchman had gone off but maintained his position in front of Russell. Three laps later, having moved over to cede the place, he then appeared to accelerate into the side of Russell’s Mercedes.View image in fullscreenMax Verstappen said of the incident: ‘In life you shouldn’t regret too many things.

The manager had certainly cut a cool and confident figure when he emerged on to the pitch about 90 minutes before kick-off for a quick temperature check with his coaches.The PSG ultras were already behind one of the goals, bobbing up and down en masse. They would be a forceful presence throughout.Luis Enriquewas aware that an omen was on his side. Every time Munich had hosted a final in Europe’s elite competition, a new champion had emerged. Nottingham Forest, 1979. Marseille, 1993. Borussia Dortmund, 1997. And Chelsea, 2012. Inter had arrived as three-time winners.PSG 2.0 have potential to dominate but young stars could be lured away | Nick AmesRead moreLuis Enrique is a spiritual person, so maybe that fed into things. What absolutely didwas the shining lighthe had in the sky. “You will be the star that guides our family,” he wrote in tribute to his daughter Xana in 2019 after she died from bone cancer at the age of nine. Luis Enrique carries more than the unimaginable pain. He feels enriched by the time he was able to spend with her.When the game got under way, everything quickly felt just right for PSG. Luis Enrique had declared his side knew “how to unpick teams like Inter, how to get that tight-knit defence to unravel”. He believed in his approach, how his players would pass and move, especially the bit about the movement – the positional fluidity, the unusual overloads, the aggression in the press, as well. A 2-0 lead after 20 minutes was fortifying.The way Luis Enrique would tell it, even at 3-0 midway through the second half he wanted a fourth because the game “could still open up” for Inter. So Khvicha Kvaratskhelia’s goal for 4-0 on 73 minutes was probablythemoment for the Spanish coach, although he seemed to really let it all out when Senny Mayulu made it five just before the end.The 19-year-old substitute, who had been on for only two minutes, was giddy with joy; disbelief even. For Luis Enrique, it was an example of his Midas touch on the night but also a symbol of something wider in terms of what he has built. An unheralded youngster ought not to be able to do this in club football’s biggest game. It is gloriously possible within Luis Enrique’s collective.View image in fullscreenSenny Mayulu had been on for only two minutes when he scored PSG’s fifth goal in the final.Photograph: Michael Zemanek/ShutterstockSomething felt crystal clear as the PSG captain, Marquinhos, emerged through the golden confetti – detonated a little early – to hoist the trophy; Luis Enrique must now be considered among the all-time greats of his profession.For him, the glory of Munich added up to a second “classic” treble of his career – league,Champions League, principle domestic cup – having achieved the feat at Barcelona in 2014-15. Only one other manager has done this: his former Barcelona and Spain teammate Pep Guardiola, who pulled it off with Barcelona in 2008‑09 and Manchester City in 2022-23. But it has been as much about how Luis Enrique has succeeded at PSG.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

You know, he inherited Lionel Messi and Neymar, with Luis Suárez added for him. Sergio Busquets, Andrés Iniesta and Xavi were already there, too.It has been different at PSG. With the help of Luís Campos, the recruitment chief, Luis Enrique has created a team – and one in the truest sense. Willian Pacho, João Neves and Désiré Doué were brought in last summer, with Kvaratskhelia, thefinal piece of the puzzle, joining in January.PSG have spent heavily; it was £200m on that quartet alone. Everything continues to stem from the wealth of the club’s Qatari owners. Yet Luis Enrique has proved his genius by assembling a largely unstarry group who play for the badge rather than themselves; a break, frankly, from previous PSG vintages. And one that is capable of hitting such beautifully sweet high notes, which has a defined and likable identity.View image in fullscreenPSG fans display a banner showing the manager, Luis Enrique, and his late daughter, Xana.Photograph: Christina Pahnke/sampics/Corbis/Getty ImagesOusmane Dembélé, who signed in the summer of 2023, which was when Luis Enrique arrived, has scored 33 goals this season. He did not add to the tally against Inter, although he did contribute two assists and was his usual threat. But it was his work without the ball, especially the energy with which he led the press, that had Luis Enrique purring.“Everyone is talking about the Ballon d’Or … I would give it to Dembélé just for his defensive work against Inter,” the manager said. “He showed what he was made of. He was a leader, he was humble.”Luis Enrique had noted a few weeks back: “The first year at a club is generally not perfect but in the second you grow more in terms of football and confidence.” He called it, he has felt it, the click coming in January when PSG stormed back from 2-0 downto win 4-2 against Guardiola’s Cityat the Parc des Princes in the penultimate Champions League group phase game.Since then, they have ridden the wave past everybody, including Liverpool, Aston Villa and Arsenal, all the way to the crowning moment against Inter. And when it was over, there was the tifo from the PSG ultras. It depicted Luis Enrique and Xana in PSG colours planting a flag in the turf, just as they had done with Barcelona after the 2015 Champions League final victory against Juventus. It was overwhelmingly emotional. Xana can be very proud of her dad.Explore more on these topicsLuis EnriqueParis Saint-GermainChampions LeaguefeaturesShareReuse this content"

For the manager, Kevin Maher, the result left him “raw” but the performance “tells you everything about the standard of the league”.Both men used their post-match remarks to press for a third promotion spot to League Two and the entertainment on offer and, more important, the size and volume of the Wembley crowd suggested they had a point. An attendance of 52,115 was the highest in history for the National League playoff, and this despite constraints on ticketing forced by disruption to transport into Wembley.Mellon said the National League was full of teams that would “make League Two better”, and his words were borne out in a match where the fitness and technical levels were impressive and the ­contrasting approaches made for a more ­interesting contest than you regularly find at the top end of the pyramid.View image in fullscreenOldham players celebrate with the trophy after their National League playoff victory.Photograph: Adam Davy/PAA clash in styles was visi­ble from the off. Oldham had already lofted a few set plays into the Southend box, some from their own half, before the Shrimpers took an early lead, the unfortunate Manny Monthé beating his own keeper with a touch of the tip of his toe as he tried to chase down a through ball from Southend’s 17‑goal right-back Gus Scott-Morriss.The Latics should have ­equalised through the teenager Vimal Yoganathan in the 17th minute, but he placed a header wide at the far post. Joe Garner had an effort cleared off the line on the half-hour and a minute before half‑time Mike Fondop chased down two Southend clearances and burst through on goal but lifted the ball wide with only the goalkeeper Nick Hayes to beat.The momentum was all with ­Oldham and their intense press unsettled Southend again just a minute after the restart. A corner was aimed at Monthé and he was hauled to the ground by Ben Goodliffe. The referee, Elliot Bell, pointed to the spot and Garner, the former Ipswich and Nottingham Forest forward, stepped up coolly, sending Hayes the wrong way.The game then slid back into equilibrium, with Southend producing decent patterns and Oldham perhaps struggling to maintain their earlier intensity. The best openings of the half only came in added time and both fell for Oldham; first a low drive from Mark Kitching that went just past the post; then an air kick from James Norwood, on as a substitute, when any connection would surely have sealed the match.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A further 68 people were arrested acrossFrance.Police were investigating whether two deaths were also linked to the unrest. They included a 17-year-old boy who died after he was reportedly stabbed in the chest late on Saturday evening in the south-west town of Dax.

The officer was struck in the eye after a firework went off accidentally, a police source told Agence France-Presse. The agency said 692 fires were reported through the night, including 264 cars that were set ablaze.MostParis Saint-Germain(PSG) fans peacefully celebrated what was their club’s first Champions League win after their 5-0 victory over Inter Milan, and a parade on Sunday evening on the Champs-Élysées passed without any significant incidents.The players were also due to be hosted by the French president, Emmanuel Macron, who is a fan of Olympique de Marseille.PSG condemned the earlier violence “in the strongest possible terms” on Sunday, adding that winning the title “should be a moment of collective joy, not of unrest and disorder”.“These isolated acts are contrary to the club’s values and in no way represent the vast majority of our supporters, whose exemplary behaviour throughout the season deserves to be commended,” the club said on social media as it called on “everyone” to “show responsibility and respect” during the parade on the Champs-Élysées.But a political row broke out over the policing of Saturday night’s events as football once again became a backdrop for tensions in French society.View image in fullscreenA riot police officer takes aim with a projectile launcher in Paris on Saturday night.Photograph: Raphaël Lafargue/ABACA/ShutterstockFrance’s interior minister, Bruno Retailleau, posted on social media on Saturday after the game: “True PSG fans are getting excited about their team’s magnificent performance.

Firing teargas into a crowd is extremely dangerous. He is responsible for the chaos,” Léaument said on X, where he posted a video showing himself and others amid teargas on the avenue on Saturday night.Jordan Bardella, the president of the far-right party Rassemblement National (National Rally), sought to make political capital out of the unrest, claiming that Paris had become “a playground for thugs”.Many of the stars of the team, one of the youngest in the competition, are drawn from the huge football talent pool in the Paris suburbs, which have also become a focal point for claims of lawlessness by the far right.View image in fullscreenRiot police on the Champs-Élysées in Paris after the match.Photograph: Abdul Saboor/ReutersAbout 5,400 police were deployed across the city for the post-match celebrations, with officers on the Champs-Élysées using teargas as well as pepper spray.A police spokesperson said a car was set alight near the Parc des Princes stadium, PSG’s home ground, where 48,000 had watched the match on big screens.

That will never ever happen.”LAFC stuns Club América in extra time to qualify for Club World CupRead moreTwo nights later at Chase Stadium, about 40 minutes south of Trump’s Xanadu at Mar-a-Lago, an unfancied but spirited and confident Vancouver Whitecaps outfitembarrassed the garish glitz of Inter Miami– rather deliciously, with the help of a couple of Americans – and easily booked their place in the final of the Concacaf Champions Cup for the very first time, becoming only the third Canadian side ever to qualify for the decider. They play Cruz Azul on Sunday night, and could end the night as the first Canadian side to win the competition – any version of it, dating back to 1962.The team’s domestic form sees them leading Major League Soccer’s Western Conference, while they’re one point from the summit of the overall standings. They’ve been on an unbeaten run of 15 games and have just two defeats in 24 across all competitions this season, but it somehow gets better. They’ve accomplished this with a noviceMLSboss, Jesper Sørensen, only in the job since the start of the year after replacing the beloved Vanni Sartini who’d led the club to back-to-back MLS playoff appearances and three successive Canadian Championship titles.Oh, and one more thing. Last December, the Whitecaps ownership group of Greg Kerfoot, Steve Luczo, Jeff Mallett and Steve Nash dropped a bombshell andannounced they were selling. Should new investors be found there’s a distinct chance the club will be relocated to an American city.Maybe it’s the Canadian way: to do good things but not speak about them very much- Axel SchusterAnd yet, the timing of such a doomsday scenario could hardly be any better. With a remarkable surge in nationalistic sentiment since Trump’s ramblings about annexing Canada, the country has never been more solidified and compelled to protect what’s theirs. The Whitecaps, a club that proudly boasts over half a century of impactful soccer history and local cultural resonance, have felt the benefit of the swell and a rescue mission is already well under way.“You wouldn’t be able to do my job if you weren’t optimistic because you always have to believe that a positive development is ahead of you,” says Axel Schuster, CEO and sporting director of theVancouver Whitecaps. “Sometimes, if there’s a risk that you’ll lose something it’s only then you realise how important it is to you.”Leaning into the patriotism and community seen in recent months, Schuster is pushing hard for a new, privately funded downtown venue for the Whitecaps at the city’s landmark PNE fairgrounds site, a stone’s throw from Empire Stadium, the original home of the Whitecaps. The team’s base at BC Place is owned by the province and greatly restricts the club’s revenue streams and commercial opportunities. A shiny asset is one distinct way of enticing new ownership to keep the team where it is and the City of Vancouver has confirmed that ‘high level discussions’ have already happened.“Maybe it’s the Canadian way: to do good things but not speak about them very much and we haven’t always told our stories,” Schuster says. “There are enough people who believe in this club being a major asset to our community and to the soccer landscape in Canada and believe that it’s worthwhile to fight for it, to keep it alive and keep it in Vancouver.”After a long stint in the Bundesliga and influential roles at Mainz and Schalke, Schuster took the Vancouver job just as a global pandemic brought everything to a halt. Since then, he’s overseen an impressive rise. Three visits to the playoffs, a mammoth increase in attendance, a litany of domestic cup success and all achieved on an always-conservative budget. In 2024, the club paid $17.4m in salaries to leave them comfortably mid-range in MLS. In contrast, Inter Miami splashed out $41.7m, while Vancouver’s cross-country rivals, Toronto FC, racked up an outlay of $31.8m. Look closely, though, and Vancouver boast a perfectly proportioned roster between small, medium and big earners.View image in fullscreenJesper Sørensen has been a revelation in his first year leading the Whitecaps.Photograph: Vancouver Whitecaps FC/MLS/Getty ImagesBut perhaps Schuster’s most impressive achievement has been ensuring off-field distractions and all of the worry, concerns and anxiety that come with an uncertain future, have not seeped on to the field or into the front office.“It hasn’t always been easy to be a Whitecaps employee and wear our badge,” he says. “When the news broke that the club was for sale, it was easy to say ‘Look, nothing will change. We’ll have the best ever season, we’ll be the most attractive club in MLS that everyone wants to own.’ But it’s something else to fill those words with real life.”Winning has, at least for now, seemed to ease that instability.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

After the second leg in Miami, I was so happy because I could feel how much it meant to everyone. To give them these special moments made me super happy. It was like we all got rewarded for everything.”Schuster felt the 2024 season had been a “missed opportunity” of sorts and that a fresh approach could unlock something new in the group. In Sørensen, he found a coach who has managed to get career-best performances out of players up and down the roster – a big reason why the team has excelled as much in continental competition as it has in MLS, where most teams involved in both tend to struggle in one or the other.We’ll make it very clear that we are not just one of 30 MLS teams. We are one team from British Columbia in Canada.- Axel Schuster“There were two main criteria that our new coach needed to have: firstly, that he was a developer with a track record of improving players and not just young players,” Schuster says. “Secondly, we didn’t want a coach who would say, ‘Some of these players won’t fit my plans and I’ll need one or two transfer windows to build a team’. We wanted someone who looked at the existing group and knew what to do with them to make it successful from the first day.”Under Sørensen’s watch, certain players have stepped up and the group has adapted impressively to the loss of talisman Ryan Gauld, sidelined since early March with a knee injury. While the likes of Brian White and Sebastian Berhalter have garnered much of the focus given theircall-ups to the US national team, Schuster pinpoints the developments of Ali Ahmed and Tristan Blackmon as examples of Sorensen’s coaching nous.View image in fullscreenBrian White and Sebastian Berhalter have been key for the Whitecaps’ great season so far.Photograph: Rich Lam/Getty Images“Ali doesn’t have that many years of being in a professional environment and Jesper has simplified his game, focusing on key areas rather than on his overall profile,” Schuster says. “Tristan Blackmon has made big progress. In all of our stats, he’s the best defender in MLS. You always felt he had the skills to be a top defender but maybe wasn’t using them in the right way. But his consistency this year has been unbelievable.”Despite the positivity this season, Schuster admits that he hardly ever enjoys watching games.What MLS can learn from the J League’s growth in JapanRead more“Even the second leg win over Inter Miami took a long time before I really believed it was done,” he says with a laugh. “During the game there is nothing to enjoy. I can’t watch with a lot of people around me, at least people I don’t know, because I get pretty active about what we could do better and should do better.”Schuster will certainly take some enjoyment from Sunday’sConcacaf Champions Cupfinal against Mexican heavyweights Cruz Azul. Because on this particular international stage at this particular time, the Vancouver Whitecaps will not represent Major League Soccer. They’ll represent the humility, ambition and unity of an entire nation.“For us, we are proud to be Canadians,” Schuster says. “Our players can appreciate living in this country and this province. I have a player who told me that at some point he might be ready to play in a more challenging league. But then he said, ‘My family feels so good and so safe here and that’s even more important than where I play’. So we also represent that. This is what we think is right. This is how a country, a city, a province should be. It’s what we stand for. We will go there as proud Canadians and we will have the Maple Leaf everywhere. And we’ll make it very clear that we are not just one of 30 MLS teams. We are one team from British Columbia in Canada.”Explore more on these topicsCanadaVancouver WhitecapsMLSConcacaf Champions CupUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

This is why you’re shit.”).Vitinha was clear: never happened. All the same this shadow interaction was cast at the time as a glimpse of the wider unease among the aristos, the powdered wigs of that star-system dressing room. Messi, Neymar and Kylian Mbappé were, it was said, “disappointed with the quality” of the club’s most recent recruits.PSG 2.0 have potential to dominate but young stars could be lured away | Nick AmesRead moreGiven those new arrivals included Vitinha and Fabián Ruiz, two-thirds of the Champions League-winning midfield, that disappointment has now presumably been served up very, very cold at Sunday’s victory buffet in Munich.But whatever the extent of those tensions there is no doubt Vitinha was still idling on the runway at that point: 23 years old and still all promise, a mix of obvious weak spots – slow, physically slight – and obvious super-strengths, most notably the strangely intimate and tender relationship with the ball.Fast forward to Saturday night and theevisceration of Interin Munich has confirmed his altered status. Vitinha is now the most effective central midfielder in the world, a Champions League‑winning fulcrum and the key lubricant in Luis Enrique’s treble-winning team.View image in fullscreenVitinha struggled to make an impact during a loan spell at Wolves.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianEveryone likes this kind of story, the late bloomer who offers an on-this-day angle at each fresh note of triumph. Let’s do it then. Four years ago Vitinha was coming on as a late sub for Wolves in a 1-0 defeat at Everton, his last loan appearance before Wolves passed up on a low‑cost option to buy him.The year before, he spent the fag-end of his first spell at Porto repeatedly coming on between the 72- and 77-minute mark. Even his squad number was 77. He was basically that 77th-minute guy, generically high technique, an avatar of promising-Velcro-touch Portuguese midfielder.Wolves had quite a few of these in their sights at the time. Who do you take the gamble on? Who can make the leap up here? For all the data, the smell test, the eye test, the gut test, nobody in football really knows about other elements, such as pressure points, will, chemistry, and the ability to produce moments of clarity when the air is thinnest, as Vitinha did to make PSG’s first goal on Saturday night.The key pass to Désiré Doué was clipped hard, raising the tempo perfectly, hitting just the right spot on Doué’s foot. It was a moment that will slip between the headline numbers, but which changed the game decisively.For Vitinha there was an assist in the second half, a through pass to Doué, who ran on to make it 3-0 and chloroform Inter into a final state of submission.It seemed fitting PSG’s deep conductor should assert himself in this way on this stage, if only because Vitinha has been utterly key to the more nuts-and-bolts transformation of the team.First as an element of control in the classic modern style, brilliant at taking the ball and funnelling it on, a footballer who will simply wear you down and make you chase, killing you softly, flooding your calves with lactic acid.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Vitinha later set up his teammate’s second goal.Photograph: Michaela Stache/AFP/Getty ImagesVitinha completed more passes than any other player in this season’s Champions League, and ended up second on kilometres covered, just behind his maniacal co-pivot João Neves. But this is not your basic ball-hog. Vitinha has something else, an ability to drive the game as well as control it, hot as well as cold possession. Against Inter his most telling stat was 44 of 46 medium-range passes completed, and it was notable how often that longer pass was the source of a shift of gear or a sudden transition.It is a quality of command that didn’t seem to come easily. It is perhaps a little overlooked, but it takes an extraordinary degree of confidence, even a kind of arrogance to run a game like this, to be the passing fulcrum in a possession-heavy team. For Vitinha the point of ignition came after his return to Porto from Wolves. Manchester United, Arsenal and Barcelona were soon being posited as likely destinations, unsurprisingly given the GDP of Portugal is basically 35% transfer rumours, 25% hidden agents’ fees.There is a sense with Vitinha in this side of a cog hitting its mark, of the perfect part for a highly engineered teamPSG, for whom no signing is ever really a gamble, were willing to pay the £35m release clause. Still there was a sense of something slightly blocked in his progress. By the time of the ghost falling-out with Messi, L’Équipe was already putting Vitinha at the heart of internal disappointment around the 2022 rebuild.A club insider was quoted as saying: “It’s the weakest since I’ve been at the club. They don’t understand why PSG let [Leandro] Paredes, Idrissa Gueye and even Julian Draxler go to recruit Vitinha, Fabián Ruiz and Carlos Soler, even if the last is a little better regarded than the other two.” Even by debauchery‑era PSG standards, always a farrago of leaks and bitchiness, it looks like a wonderful line now.Désiré Doué joins the global A-list to lead PSG’s coronation as kings of Europe | Barney RonayRead moreLuis Enrique deserves most creditfor the way Vitinha has flowered, encouraging him to act as an autonomous passing unit, a roving brain. How far can this go? There is a sense with Vitinha in this PSG team of a cog hitting its mark, of the perfect part for a highly engineered team, like installing exactly the right replacement reverse flange‑torque transponder in a luxury German saloon car.Wolves may have failed to see the endgame with this slow‑burn child of Xavi but it is also significant that English football still doesn’t produce this type of player, the pure passing technician.There is no doubt Vitinha, or even half a Vitinha, would have seriously upgraded any of the trophy-curious England teams of the past few years. As he has with PSG, who have a chance now to rule the world at the grisly but hugely lucrative Club World Cup. Who knows, along the way Vitinha 2.0 may even get a chance to make Messi look bad again.Explore more on these topicsParis Saint-GermainChampions LeagueEuropean club footballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I’m just incredibly proud of the whole team over the three weeks. It’s a sweet success.“I’ve spent a lot of my life targeting this race. There’s been a lot of setbacks, and it has been hard to deal with. I’m in disbelief that I have finally managed to pull it off.”Britain’s Simon Yates seals Giro d’Italia in Rome for second Grand Tour titleRead moreYates, who had been on the verge of winning the 2018 Giro when he endured a dramatic collapse in the pivotal mountain stage, is the third British rider, after Chris Froome and Tao Geoghegan Hart, to win the Italian race.The Lancastrian arrived in Rome wearing all-pink kit with matching pink bike, in honour of the Giro’smaglia rosa, and was shepherded safely through the final processional sprint stage to secure final victory.Ahead of him his Visma-Lease a Bike teammate Olav Kooij took the final stage in a sprint, as a beaming Yates celebrated in his wake. “We couldn’t wish for a better final weekend,” Kooij said. “Yesterday was really amazing for the team and today I had to give everything that was left in the legs.”Yates’s Giro-winning attack on the crucial climb of the Finestre, the mountain that had dramatically proved his undoing in 2018, stunned onlookers and exploded the overall standings.On social media Geraint Thomas said: “What is going on?!”, as he watched Saturday’s drama between the three key protagonists – Yates, Isaac Del Toro and Richard Carapaz – unfold.View image in fullscreenSimon Yates during the final stage in Rome.Photograph: Luca Bettini/AFP/Getty ImagesReminded that Yates had far more experience of Grand Tour racing than the 21‑year‑old Del Toro, Thomas, winner of the 2018 Tour de France, was scathing. “Do you need experience to realise that third place is pulling away and that, if you stop pedalling, he’s going to take time out of you? My son Macs would know that, and he’s five years old.”Even Yates seemed overwhelmed by the scale of his achievement on the mountain that had once proven his downfall. “I always had in the back of my mind that maybe I could come here and close the chapter. Maybe not to take the jersey in the race, but at least the stage, to try to show myself the way I know I can do.”He admitted, though, that he “really did not believe” such a dream scenario was possible. “I am not really an emotional person, but coming to the finish I couldn’t hold back the tears.”Del Toro, who had appeared like Yates in 2018 destined to win the race, hid his disappointment. “Yates was the most intelligent,” the Mexican said. “It was good for his team and how they played the tactics.”But Carapaz, Giro champion in 2019, rounded on the Mexican. “In the end, Del Toro lost the Giro,” the Ecuadorian said. “He didn’t know how to race and in the end the smartest [rider] won.”Juan Manuel Gárate, Carapaz’s EF Education EasyPost sports director, sought to justify the lack of any serious pursuit of Yates. “There came a moment where you had to decide: ‘If Yates goes, let him go. If Del Toro doesn’t follow, he loses the GC.’ To win, you have to play the game. And with that comes the risk of losing.”Explore more on these topicsGiro d'ItaliaSimon YatesCyclingnewsShareReuse this content"

She had simply not shown up. As Elena Rybakina bulldozed through the early stages of their highly anticipated fourth-round tussle, Swiatek trailed 6-1, 2-0 and her hopes of victory were fading.For much of this year, Swiatek has struggled to find her form when forced into difficult positions against her toughest rivals. However, she showed her resilience here with a supreme 1-6, 6-3, 7-5 statement win against the 12th seed, to return to the quarter-finals of theFrench Open.French Open: Swiatek and Sabalenka advance, Paolini out – as it happenedRead moreFive years since her first French Open title, Swiatek’s era of dominance at Roland Garros now stands at 25 consecutive victories, the longest winning run here among female players in the 21st century. This win could have a transformative effect on the Pole’s confidence as she tries to shake off her difficult run of form and recover self‑belief, in her attempt to become the first woman in history to win the French Open singles title four times in a row.“I think I needed that kind of win to feel these feelings that I’m able to win under pressure, and even if it’s not going the right way, still turn the match around to win it,” Swiatek said. “For sure it’s a great confirmation for me. I for sure wanted to have a match like that. Obviously it’s great to also have full control over the match, but against great players it’s not always going to be possible. I’m happy that I fought, and I also problem-solved on court.”Although she avoided a fourth‑round meeting with her nemesis Jelena Ostapenko, who holds a 6-0 record against the five‑time grand slam title winner, Swiatek still found herself up against one of her toughest rivals. Rybakina’s own recent struggles are reflected in her seeding of No 12. At her best, however, the 2022 Wimbledon champion is one of the top four players in the world.With her precise, destructive serve and the effortless power she generates with her groundstrokes, Rybakina’s game also matches up extremely well against Swiatek’s. The Kazakhstani played flawless attacking tennis for 45 minutes as she established a set and break lead: “In the first set it felt like I was playing Jannik Sinner,” Swiatek said.View image in fullscreenElena Rybakina played a flawless first set.Photograph: Denis Balibouse/ReutersDespite her high-profile difficulties this year, Swiatek has still been more consistent than the vast majority of the tour this year. Her problems have arisen usually against the best players. When she has been pushed by quality players, she has often become overwhelmed by her own doubts. This time, she continued to think clearly under pressure.From 6-1, 2-0 down, Swiatek gradually worked her way back into the match, particularly using her heavy topspin forehand to force Rybakina back and drag her out wide on her forehand side. Swiatek also opted to take a deeper return position, a significant departure on her usual position close to the baseline, which allowed her more time to return Rybakina’s imperious serve. After working through numerous tight games early on, Swiatek established greater momentum and forced a third set.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Swiatek saved three break points at 2-3 then, after finally breaking serve to lead 4-3, she handed the momentum back with another double fault. No matter, in the most consequential match of the tournament so far, which would have been a worthy final, Swiatek played positive attacking tennis under immense pressure until the end. Instead of allowing the tension to overwhelm her, she searched for solutions until she found them.Swiatek will next face the 13th seed, Elina Svitolina, who produced a brilliant comeback victory herself on a spectacular day in the women’s draw. Despite facing three match points, Svitolina recovered to defeat Jasmine Paolini – the fourth seed, and runner‑up last year – to reach her fifth quarter‑final in Paris.

The second seed faced three set points in the opening‑set tie-break but was clinical on the important points and, after conceding the third set, recovered impressively to close out the match without further trouble.Alcaraz will next face the 12th seed, Tommy Paul, who cruised into the quarter-finals for the first time in his career with a 6-3, 6-3, 6-3 win against Alexei Popyrin.Explore more on these topicsFrench Open 2025Iga SwiatekFrench OpenTennisnewsShareReuse this content"

He succumbed 6-3, 6-3, 6-3 on a sun-soaked Court Suzanne Lenglen in a bloodless fourth-round clash on Sunday.Outplayed by the world No 12 in all departments, this was a huge letdown for 25th seed Popyrin who had been hoping to go at least one round further than last year’s US Open, when he had downed Novak Djokovic before falling in the last 16 to another American, Frances Tiafoe.Jannik Sinner eases past Lehecka to stay on track for first French Open titleRead morePopyrin’s exit means that only Daria Kasatkina, in her first slam since gaining permanent residency, is now the last Australian standing. Kasatkina faces the Russian teenage sensation Mirra Andreeva in Monday’s fourth-round match.Popyrin had harboured such high hopes going into the match after not dropping a set in his first three contests, and all started swimmingly as he broke the 28-year-old Paul in the opening game. Alas, that was as good as it got for the Sydneysider.Paul saved the rest of the 10 break points he faced throughout the match, never allowing the Australian to get a foothold, while 37 unforced errors told of Popyrin’s underwhelming day.The tough American had battled through two consecutive five-setters to reach this stage but was relieved to advance quickly past Popyrin. Paul becomes the first American man in the quarter-finals here since Andre Agassi in 2003, and could still be joined by compatriots Ben Shelton and Tiafoe.“I am very glad [about] a straight-sets win. I have been playing some long matches, so that one felt really good,” said Paul, who had spent over three-and-a-half hours more on court than Popyrin before Sunday’s match. “My team has been doing a great job getting ready for each match but definitely shorter matches like this help a lot.”View image in fullscreenAlexei Popyrin broke in the opening game, but quickly saw the match slip away from him.Photograph: Yoan Valat/EPAPaul’s toughness was evident when Popyrin had two break points at 3-3, which the American repelled in the opening set before cashing in on a Popyrin double fault for a 5-3 lead.Serving for the set, Paul found himself for once on the back foot as Popyrin earned three break-back points. But the 12th seed showed huge resolve to fight back and seal the set in 42 minutes.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Any chance of a comeback was soon extinguished when Paul, for a third set running, struck with an early break.Popyrin cut a forlorn figure by the time a 26th Paul winner flashed by him on match point, the contest over inside two hours.

The 25-year-old Mexican outworked and outlanded Plant over 12 rounds, handing the American his second straight loss and third in his last five fights.“I knew that everybody was going to be against me, because on paper of course he was the favorite,” Reséndiz said. “But I believed in myself. My corner believed in me. And then we did exactly what we came to do.”Reséndiz pressed the action from the opening bell, walking down Plant and scoring with heavy right hands and left hooks. He had a strong third round and broke through again in the seventh, wobbling Plant with a counter right and a left hook. According to CompuBox, Reséndiz outlanded Plant 186 to 108 and landed 31% of his punches to Plant’s 21%.“I knew I was going to win,” Reséndiz said. “I didn’t worry at all. I knew it was going to be a tough fight and we gave them a great fight. I’m ready to fight anyone. Whoever the public wants.”Plant (23-3, 14 KOs) relied on movement and the jab but struggled to keep Reséndiz off of him. Two judges gave Reséndiz each of the final seven rounds.“I felt like it was close and in a close fight, sometimes it switches the other way,” Plant said. “I feel like I was in control enough and using the whole ring, using my jab, but the judges saw it the other way.”Plant insisted he was never seriously hurt.“It wasn’t that he was putting so much pressure on me,” he said. “He caught me with one overhand right. That was pretty good. But other than that, nothing really hurt me or stunned me.”The 31-year-old former IBF titleholder said he plans to regroup and return.“I felt like I did good,” he said. “I used my jab, I used the whole ring and was patient, but I wasn’t the better man tonight. I’ll just get back with my team. Go home to my family, spend time with my daughter. My son’s on the way and you know we’ll regroup and we’ll be back.”Charlo scores TKO in comeback fightIn the co-main event, unbeaten two-division champion Jermall Charlo made a successful return to the ring, stopping Thomas LaManna after five one-sided rounds.Charlo (34-0, 23 KOs) dropped LaManna three times, scoring knockdowns in the third, fourth and fifth rounds before the bout was stopped at the start of round six on the advice of the ringside physician.“It feels good to be back,” Charlo said. “I’m thankful to everyone who stood by me. I love y’all. I’m back. You know you gotta go through things to get better.”Charlo, fighting for the first time since June 2021, looked sharp behind a heavy jab and clean combinations. He landed 44 jabs and repeatedly hurt LaManna (39-6-1, 18 KOs) with straight rights and left hooks. A left hook in the third round sent LaManna down for the first time. Another left in the fourth forced LaManna to take a knee, and a video review between rounds overturned the referee’s initial no-knockdown ruling.In the fifth, Charlo landed a flush right hand that dropped LaManna for a third time. Although LaManna made it to the bell, the doctor waved off the fight before the sixth round began.“I’m just looking to stay well-known and relevant,” Charlo said. “No more dark places and keep my head straight. I just want to encourage everyone in the world, keep God first, keep God first.”LaManna said Charlo’s timing and jab were better than expected.“It is what it is, I did the best I could,” LaManna said. “The doctors are here for a reason and they made their decision. I’m disappointed, but it’s boxing. Charlo was sharper than I expected. He’s a two-time world champion for a reason.”Explore more on these topicsBoxingUS sportsShareReuse this content"

Though the ugly heart of the Trump administration has hardly been hidden, there is an especially grotesque contrast between its vaunted family values and its treatment of the young.On the campaign trail, Donald Trumpdeclared: “I want a baby boom.” JD Vance, his vice-president, says he wants “more happy children in our country”. Magapro-natalistsare pushingincentivesfor families to have more children.Yet Bruce Lesley, president of the advocacy organisation First Focus on Children, says that we may never have seen an administration “so laser-focused on targeting the nation’s children for harm”. Its dismantling of the Department of Education ison holdthanks to a judge. But it has already slashed staff at agenciesoverseeing key servicessuch as child protection and the enforcement of child support payments. Mr Trump’s “big, beautiful” budget sacrifices the interests of babies for those of billionaires, slashing foundational programmes that provide healthcare and food tomore than two-fifths of American children.One detail is telling: it would also deny the child tax credit to families with mixed immigration status. Mr Trump’s vision of the nation is the antithesis of Mr Mandela’s inclusivity. Unaccompanied migrant children as young as four arefacing immigration hearingswithout lawyers. That’s unlikely to concern him: as many as 1,360 children separated from their parents at the border in his first termhave never been reunitedwith them.An estimated 5.6 million US-citizen children live with at least one undocumented parent. Almost 4% are at risk of beingleft with no parent in their homein the event of mass deportation. Mr Trump’s attempt toend birthright citizenshipmakes explicit the belief that these children are not truly American either. They are what the historian Prof Mae Ngaihas called “alien citizens”, whose standing is deemed suspect – if not denied – due to their race. Young US citizens have beendeported alongside parentswho say they were given no option to leave their children, one of whom had late-stage cancer. In another case, a two-year-old was sent to foster care when her parents were deported: this time, her mother was reportedlygiven no option to take her.The immigration crackdown will further encourage employersshort of workersto turn to children – often those born to migrants – for badly paid, dirty and dangerous jobs. “Why do we say we need to import foreigners, even import them illegally, when teenagers used to work at these resorts?”askedFlorida’s governor, Ron deSantis. Child labour laws are already too frequently ignored, yet Republicans haveloosened them furtherin 16 states in the last few years, and sought to do so in many more.Florida’s House of Representatives recently approved legislation allowing children as young as 14to work overnight without breaks. Yet the state Senate chose not to move the bill – and overall more statesstrengthened than dilutedlabour protections last year. For now at least, the administrationappears to have reversed courseon eliminating the Head Start early education programme. Mr Trump and his allies are exposing their grim vision of a nation in which only some children deserve to be treated with care and basic respect. Others must continue to fight to protect the most vulnerable.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Since then, she’s consistently drawn attention to the tragedy in Palestine bysharingstatistics on the crisis along with images of Palestinian children with her social media audience of tens of millions of followers, and the right has been after her since.The anti-woke warriors used to defend free speech. Now they make McCarthyism look progressive | Arwa MahdawiRead moreBack in March, the New York Post ran anarticleabout Accurso calling her a “Woke brainwasher” and warning parents against the influence they were allowing into their homes.Then, last month, the pro-Israel group StopAntisemitism asked the Department of Justiceto investigatewhether Ms Rachel was operating as a foreign agent because of her posts about children in Gaza. In an open letter to the US attorney general, Pam Bondi, they asked authorities to find out whether Accurso was “being remunerated to disseminate Hamas-aligned propaganda to her millions of followers”.Meanwhile,tens of thousands of childrenhave been killed or injured in Gaza since Israel began its onslaught in retaliation for Hamas’s 7 October 2023 attack – and Israel isn’t letting up, even aschildren face starvation. Last Saturday,Israeli airstrikes killednine of a Gaza doctor’s 10 children while she worked. If speaking up about a genocide makes you a foreign agent, what does that say about the US’s own values?“I care deeply for all children. Palestinian children, Israeli children, children in the US – Muslim, Jewish, Christian children – all children, in every country,” Accursosaidthrough tears on Instagram video from May of 2024. “To do a fundraiser for children who are currently starving, who have no food or water, who are being killed, is human.”For this kind of thing – caring about innocent children – to be controversial is a clear sign of just how far we’ve strayed from our moral core as a society, and a reminder of the inhumanity that pervades this political moment.One of the distinct markers of pro-Israel rhetoric in recent times has been the way it intentionally and violently rejects the idea of children being vulnerable and innocent. Israel’s supporters feel emboldened to castbabiesas collateral damage at best, and “enemies” at their most truly unhinged. And the pro-Israel crowd is angry at Accurso because in a war that does not want us to see them as such, she constantly reminds us that Palestinian children are people, and are deserving of the same kind of care and protection that the west gives its young.Her love for children has also made her an easy target for conservatives who like to label LGBTQ+ people and their allies as creeps and pedophiles looking to groom children. Last year, when Accurso shared a video celebrating Pride month on herInstagramandTikTokaccounts (which are geared toward her adult supporters, of course), rightwing influencers called her “sick” andcomplainedthat she was exposing children to “things they shouldn’t be exposed to”.What it’s like to be in the graduating class of 2025 in Gaza | Nadera MushthaRead moreFor me, Accurso’s speaking out also shines a harsh light on the absolute dearth of outrage from other far more powerful and influential celebrities. This month, more than 300 celebrities and Hollywood figuressignedan open letter condemning the industry’s silence on the genocide. This belated effort falls flat when you consider how people with much less power and way more to lose have risked their livelihoods and safety to speak up for what is right.Overall, though, the hatred for Accurso isn’t just aboutGaza. As a public figure, she is an indictment of everything that rightwingers want us to believe is bad. She’s all about big feelings, standing up for vulnerable people, making people from all walks of life feel included, and celebrating what makes us different. Of course the right hates that.Figures like Accurso are an aberration in a world where bad news generates the most clicks and we are all supposed to be desensitized to the ways vulnerable people continue to have their lives, and the few protections they have left, snatched away from them.Tayo Bero is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warOpinionYouTubeIsraelGazaChildrenSocial mediacommentShareReuse this content"

The proposed legislative cuts, includinghistoric attacks on Medicaid and Snap, come at a time when60% of Americansalready cannot make ends meet. As justification, Maga Republicans are once again invoking the shibboleth of work requirements to demean and discredit the poor, even as they funnel billions of dollars into thewar economyand lavish the wealthy withtax cuts.As anti-poverty organizers, we’ve often used the slogan: “They say cut back, we say fight back.” It’s a catchy turn of phrase, but it reveals that for too long we’ve been on the back foot. In the world’s richest country, in which mass poverty exists beside unprecedented plenty, we’re tired of just fending off the worst attacks. Too much ground is lost when our biggest wins are simply not losing past gains. Amid Trump’s cruelty and avarice, it’s time to fight for a new social contract – one that lifts from the bottom of society so that everybody rises.There are no shortcuts to building the kind of popular power necessary for us to shift from defense to offense. The task is a generational one, requiring even greater discipline, sacrifice, perseverance and patience. But as we consider the best way forward, the past offers clues.What the last Trump presidency can teach us about fighting back | Kenneth RothRead moreIn our new book,You Only Get What You’re Organized to Take: Lessons from the Movement to End Poverty, we document insights from some of this country’s most significant poor people’s movements. As nascent fascism continues to metastasize, these largely untold stories contain some of the very solutions we need to prevent democratic decline and overcome bigotry, political violence, Christian nationalism and economic immiseration. Today, the historic demands of the poor – for safety, belonging, peace, equality and justice – are rapidly becoming the demands of humanity. The hard-fought wisdom of the organized poor has much to teach all of us.We’re reminded of the welfare rights movement of the 1960s and 1970s, especially theNational Welfare Rights Organization(NWRO). Largely forgotten to history, NWRO was once the biggest poor people’s organization in the country. The organization, led by poor Black women, regularly staged mass marches and demonstrations and held picket lines and sit-ins at welfare offices, at a time when the poor were subject to racist, exclusionary and moralizing policies. At its height, the organization had more than 100 local chapters, asophisticated operationthat offered a political and spiritual home to more than 20,000 dues-paying members.In 1971 in Nevada, where the governor was cutting the social safety net, the local NWRO chapter organized 1,000 women tostorm Caesars Palace, the luxury hotel and casino, and shut down the main drag in Las Vegas. The protest turned into a multiyear campaign of civil disobedience, and a federal judge eventually reinstated the benefits. These women were unapologetically militant and willing to take big risks. They were also clear that forging power required the less visible spadework of movement-building – including looking after one another through networks of solidarity and collective care.At the same time as the Black Panthers were feeding tens of thousands of children through thefree breakfast program(and provocatively asking why the government couldn’t do the same, even as it spent billions of dollars slaughtering the poor of Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos), NWRO created its own innovative “projects of survival”. The historian Annelise Orleckwrites that in Las Vegas, the “welfare moms applied for and won federal grants to open and run … the first health clinic in the largely Black, and thoroughly poor Westside of Las Vegas. Then came the neighborhood’s first library, public swimming pool, senior citizen housing project, solarization program, crime prevention program, and community newspaper, all organized and staffed by poor mothers and later their young adult children.”As the experience in Las Vegas revealed, the women of NWRO were organizers, caretakers and strategists of the highest order. They were also anti-racists and feminists of an entirely new mold. At a time when many women were fighting for equality within the workplace, NWRO championed “welfare as a right”, challenging the notion that the value of a human is tied to their ability to work within the marketplace and raising fundamental questions about how a society cares for its people. This idea coalesced into their demand for a “guaranteed adequate income”, an early precursor to the expanded child tax credit in 2021. Before this pandemic-era program was abandoned by both reactionary Republicans and recalcitrant Democrats, it lifted 4 million children above the poverty line, thesingle-largest decrease in official child povertyin American history.In alegendary articlefor the 1972 spring issue of Ms Magazine, Johnnie Tillmon, the first chairperson of NWRO and later its executive director, wrote: “For a lot of middle-class women in this country, Women’s Liberation is a matter of concern. For women on welfare, it’s a matter of survival … As far as I’m concerned, the ladies of NWRO are the frontline troops of women’s freedom. Both because we have so few illusions and because our issues are so important to all women – the right to a living wage for women’s work, the right to life itself.”Veterans of the welfare rights movement named their model of grassroots organizing after Tillmon. In “the Johnnie Tillmon model”, poor women, and poor people more broadly, are not simply an oppressed identity group but a latent social force with potentially vast power. Because they have the least invested in the status quo and the most to gain from big change, they are strategically positioned to rise up and rally not just their own communities, but the millions more who are one paycheck, healthcare crisis, job loss, debt collection or eviction away from poverty.In order to harness this transformational power, the Johnnie Tillmon model proposes four strategic principles, as relevant today as they were in the 1960s and 1970s:The poor must unite across their differences and assume strong leadership within grassroots movements.These movements must operate as a politically and financially independent force in our public life.The leaders of these movements must attend to the daily needs and aspirations of their communities by building visionary projects of survival.These projects of survival must serve as bases of operation for broader organizing, political education and leadership development.The women of NWRO believed there was unrecognized ingenuity and untapped brilliance within their communities. Even before the organization existed, the tens of thousands of women who made up its membership were already leaders in countless ways: they knew how to pool their meager resources, feed one another, navigate treacherous government bureaucracy and protect themselves from brutal state-sanctioned violence. When such survival skills were collectivized, networked and politicized, these women became a force to be reckoned with.The same could be true today. As theTrump administrationintensifies its attacks on life-saving programs like Medicaid and Snap, poor and dispossessed people will not passively swallow their suffering. Already, in states as far-flung as Vermont and Alaska, Michigan and North Carolina, we’re seeing an upsurge of resistance among Medicaid recipients. But we cannot be satisfied simply with righteous acts of protest and mass mobilization. The question is how to transform our growing indignation into lasting and visionary power.

But the truth about this team – and Tom Thibodeau’s coaching – lies somewhere in the messy middle.The Knicks are out. They were eliminated by the Indiana Pacers for the second straight campaign, bowing out from the Eastern Conference finals in six games instead oflast year’s seven-game lossin the East semis. As the franchise’s best season in a generation comes to a close, the Knicks are trying to figure out how to feel.Knicks fandom is a hell of a place. Like the US political scene, it allows only two positions: praise or condemnation. Rational analysis rarely gains traction. Hyperbole prevails. It’s two sides of the same rotten coin.Relentless Pacers overrun Knicks to set up NBA finals showdown with ThunderRead moreThis season wasn’t a referendum on Thibodeau’s genius or ineptitude. It was something more complicated: a year of real progress, missed chances and rising expectations.One faction scapegoats Thibodeau without fully understanding their critiques. Some want him fired and replaced by Queens native Michael Malone – who wasjust fired himself. Others float assistants like Chris Quinn, but can’t articulate his philosophy beyond buzzwords. Often, these arguments mask a lack of understanding more than a coherent vision.Meanwhile, another camp defends Thibodeau’s every move, refusing to question his substitution patterns, rigid rotations or reliance on hard zone. Terms like “drop coverage” and “schemes” have become lazy shorthand for tribalized opinions.But just like the disappearing middle ground in national discourse, the truth lies somewhere in between.This was the Knicks’ first trip to the Eastern Conference finals in 25 years. That progress only happened because ownership finally stepped aside. Once James Dolan hired former agent Leon Rose and gave him room to operate, the team pivoted from star-chasing to smart-drafting, financially-disciplined and culture-building.Rose hired Thibodeau, his former client, to instill a ready-to-work mentality, then brought in Jalen Brunson, who emerged as a legitimate MVP candidate. Last summer Rose doubled down, cashing in draft capital and depth to reunite Brunson with Villanova teammate Mikal Bridges and adding Karl-Anthony Towns, OG Anunoby and Josh Hart.View image in fullscreenNew York fans watch the game as the Knicks fall further behind the Indiana Pacers during the second quarter on Saturday at a watch party held at Madison Square Garden.Photograph: Angelina Katsanis/Getty ImagesThat core delivered 51 wins and propelled New York to fifth in offensive rating (117.3) and eighth in net rating (4.0). They gutted out a first-round win over Detroit, then stunned top-seeded Boston in six behind a lethal Brunson-Towns pick-and-roll and a defense that played the gaps and switched more aggressively than at any point in the regular season.But against Indiana, their momentum stalled. The Pacers’ fast-paced 10-man rotation overwhelmed New York. They sent waves of defenders at Brunson, while Andrew Nembhard turned in the best defensive series of his career. Afterthat epic collapse in the series opener, Thibodeau had already shortened the rotation to seven for Game 2. He brought in Mitchell Robinson and Deuce McBride to shore up the pick-and-roll defense, where Brunson and Towns are most vulnerable.In Game 3, Thibodeau improvised, going nine-deep. Towns scored 20 of his 24 points in the fourth quarter to erase a 20-point deficit. Delon Wright and Landry Shamet were crucial on the defensive end. But in Game 4, neither Wright nor Shamet played in the third quarter, when Indiana seized control. They returned in the fourth, but Thibodeau closed with his usual starters, a group that was minus-20 in the series and minus-41 across the playoffs. Despite being plus-8 in Game 3, McBride, Wright and Shamet never shared the floor together in Game 4. Thibodeau’s most damaging choice may have been closing with Hart over McBride, who had barely guarded Tyrese Haliburton.Does Tom Thibodeau really run his players into the ground? The data says ... not exactlyRead moreIronically, Thibodeau made the same decisions in Game 5, but the Knicks won and critics went quiet. Wright and Shamet again sat the third quarter. Robinson again didn’t close. The hypocrisy of Thibs detractors borders on performative.The Knicks played from behind in nearly every playoff game except Game 5. Critics use this as justification to call for Thibodeau’s dismissal. But 17 turnovers in Games 4 and 6 – not a product of coaching – were decisive. The team’s 19.5 assists per game in the series weren’t on Thibodeau either. He ran a wide array of actions – horn sets, pin-downs, DHO, high pick-and-roll – but Indiana smothered secondary options, forcing Brunson and Towns into iso-heavy, low-efficiency looks.Brunson recorded just five assists to Towns across the entire series. That lack of connection played right into Rick Carlisle’s hands. His game plan – blitzing on switches, walling off Hart and Bridges in the lane – was clinical. Carlisle outcoached Thibodeau. But there’s no shame in that. Carlisle is a champion and one of the sharpest minds in the game.Every player in the Knicks’ main seven-man rotation had a fatal flaw: Bridges’ handle, Anunoby’s rebounding, Hart’s shooting, Robinson’s durability, McBride’s playmaking.Thibodeau isn’t a fraud or a genius. He gave fans what they asked for: deeper rotations, experimental lineups, extended minutes for the Towns-Robinson twin tower pairing. It still wasn’t enough. The Pacers were simply better.View image in fullscreenKnicks point guard Jalen Brunson, right, is defended by the Pacers’ Andrew Nembhard during Game 6.Photograph: Gregory Shamus/Getty ImagesNow it’s on Rose to retool the roster. That likely starts with keeping Robinson as the starting center and reconsidering Hart’s role. His lack of shooting limits five-out spacing and his defense, once a calling card, has regressed. He struggled consistently on switches and blew key rotations.Brunson and Towns remain elite offensively, but both are liabilities in transition and in ball-screen coverage. The Knicks’ regular-season defense was 2.8 points per 100 possessions better with Towns off the floor. In the playoffs, that gap narrowed –but problems remained. Thibodeau tried everything: starting Robinson, pre-switching with Anunoby, plugging in Hart. When Towns dropped, Indiana hit jumpers. When he switched, they beat him off the dribble. By Game 6, the starting unit had a minus-33 defensive rating. Poor communication plagued them all season.This wasn’t a collapse. It was a ceiling.The Knicks are no longer a punchline. They’re a real team with real stakes and real expectations. Every game in this series was winnable. They weren’t embarrassed, but they were outplayed.Visibility brings volume, however. The higher the stakes, the louder the takes. Knicks fandom now operates like a two-party system. Its future may depend on whether fan – and the franchise – can embrace complexity instead of shouting past each other.Explore more on these topicsNew York KnicksNBAIndiana PacersBasketballcommentShareReuse this content"

His cowardice only makes a war with Taiwan more likelySimon TisdallThe US president’s strange mix of weakness and anti-Beijing hostility may be pushing Xi Jinping towards a fateful decisionSun 1 Jun 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 1 Jun 2025 15.49 EDTShareThe belief that bad things come in threes is an old superstition with scant basis in fact. Still, in these disordered times, it’s natural to wonder whether war in Europe and the Middle East will be followed by war in Asia. Nuclear-armed India and Pakistan, firing off insults and missiles,recently demonstratedhow real that prospect is. Emboldened by its alliance with Russia, North Korea’s unpredictable rogue regime threatens almost everyone.Yet it is China’s accelerating confrontation with US-backed Taiwan that forms the most alarming panel in this gloomy Asian triptych. China’s president, Xi Jinping, has reportedly told his generals to beready by 2027to conquer the self-governing island, which he regards as stolen sovereign territory. US officials warned last week that China already has sufficientcapability to invadenow, with amphibious landing craft, D-day-style floating docks, paratroopers and expanded air combat and missile forces in a constant state of readiness.Recent intimidating offshore military exercises – pessimists call them “rehearsals” – and propaganda and disinformation offensives suggest that politically, too, Beijing is preparing for a fight. It denounces Lai Ching-te, elected Taiwan’s president last year, as a pro-independence “destroyer of peace”. For his part Lai is talking tough, describing China as a “hostile foreign force” and enacting “17 strategies” to curb sabotage and spying. A new Taiwanese TV drama,Zero Day, depicts the frightful impact of an invasion on an unprepared nation.While cross-straitstensions are certainly high, a war between China and Taiwan has often been predicted but has so far been avoided. Since 1979, when the US established diplomatic relations with Beijing and de-recognised Taiwan (while pledging to help it defend itself), peace has held. But calculations change and complacency is dangerous. China is vastly more powerful now than it was 10 or 20 years ago. And for Xi, who turns 72 in June, unification is a legacy project.A range of other factors may be pushing Xi towards a fateful decision, notably Donald Trump’s strange mix of anti-China aggression and personal weakness. The US president could hike his punitive tariffs on China’s exports at any moment, threatening an estimated 9m manufacturing jobs. His hostility towards the US’s biggest rival is evident, seen again last week indiscriminatory curbson technology transfers and Chinese student visas.These crude attempts todamage a Chinese economystruggling with sluggish post-Covid growth and high unemployment are akin to holding a gun to Xi’s head. Does Trump realise how deeply provocative this is? Chinese Communist party control ultimately depends not on elections but on economic success and shared prosperity. Deliberately or not, Trump is assaulting the foundations of the CCP’s power and authority.If pushed too hard, and egged on by hardline nationalist cadres, there’s a risk Xi could call Trump’s bluff with two questions. Does he want a trade war or a real war? Or would he prefer to cut a deal instead – andabandon Taiwan?Were China to obstruct Taiwanese maritime traffic, launch covert cyber-attacks on Taiwan, or impose a full naval and aerial blockade that fell short of all-out invasion, it could force Trump into a humiliating climbdown. It’s no secret Washington opinion is split overdefending Taiwan militarily. Under Trump, the longstanding policy of “strategic ambiguity” has turned into one of chronic pusillanimity.Trump doesn’t want a war in east Asia, and Beijing knows it. It also rightly suspects that, like bullies everywhere, his aggressive bluster conceals a coward’s weakness. He refuses to fight for Ukraine, a core western interest, and kowtows to Russian aggression. He’s terrified Israel will start full-scale wars with Iran and Syria, drawing in the US. His policies are driven by self-interest, money and fear, not principles, treaties or laws.Trump risks driving Europe into China’s embrace. Xi Jinping will be delighted | Orville SchellRead moreSo when people ask if Trump will fight for Taiwan, the answer is not really in serious doubt. In recent months Trump has suggested that Taiwan, like European Nato countries, is exploiting the US security umbrella and not paying enough for its own defence. He has criticised Taipei for supposedly monopolising the semi-conductor market at the expense of US jobs, andimposed tariffs on its exports. None of this inspires confidence in his approach, should a crisis occur.Some American commentators argue that Taiwan is a bear trap, to be avoided at all costs – music to Xi’s ears. Security researchers Jennifer Kavanagh and Stephen Wertheim recentlyargued in Foreign Affairsthat US leaders need a middle path. “Instead of clarifying its commitment to defend Taiwan, Washington should … downplay the importance of keeping the island out of Beijing’s hands,” they wrote. To many, that will sound like surrender.Amid this policy confusion, Taiwan presents a vulnerable target. Lai’s tough line is opposed by many in Taipei, where political schisms are purposely inflamed by Beijing.Defence spending is rising, but not fast enough. Promised US weapons don’t arrive. The island’s notional borders are breached at will by Chinese ships and aircraft. Its armed forces and military doctrines require urgent modernisation. These problems may improve over time – which is another reason why Xi may not wish to wait.Conventional wisdom suggests Beijing prizes geopolitical and economic stability above all else. But what if this comfortable assumption is wrong? Xi surely frames the battle forTaiwanas part of the wider contest between the US and China for regional partners, military superiority and global hegemony. Now a golden opportunity is arising. Thanks to Trump’s chaotic tariffs, domestic firefights, isolationist policies and wanton disruption of European and Asian alliances, the US now looks beatable.InChina, three is considered a lucky number. Hong Kong returned to the fold in 1997, followed by Macau in 1999. Xi wants to complete the hat-trick before he’s done dictating. Watching Trump’s Crazy Gang White House carry on, China’s leader could be forgiven for thinking Taiwan – and its American protectors – are there for the taking.Simon Tisdall is a Guardian foreign affairs commentatorExplore more on these topicsTaiwanOpinionDonald TrumpXi JinpingChinaAsia PacificcommentShareReuse this content"

This is interesting in itself, as parts of it were written around the 4th century BCE, when only the privileged could read and write.Why would the authors of this text, men of privilege, be interested in people who were considered at the time to be “less than normal”?The answer relates, at least in part, to the fact that the text was critical of how its society promoted and prioritised the “valuable” or “useful”, and what was regarded as important to humanity.Within such a society, whatever – orwhoever– falls short of the accepted standards is seen in demeaning ways. But the Zhuangzi rejects this way of thinking.My sister was diagnosed with cancer – and it taught me the meaning of surrender | Making sense of itRead moreSo how might we put some of its persepctives into practice today?Reflect on what we think is ‘valuable’ or ‘useless’The Zhuangzi tells the story of a wondrous tree, so large that its canopy provided shade for thousands of oxen. The tree only became this large because its wood was deemed to be “useless” for any human project. As a result, it was left alone and allowed to grow into its magnificent size.This story shows how easy it is for us to adopt entrenched values. Are we guided too much by what society tells us is “useless”? The story makes us turn the tables on our own assumptions, and challenges our thinking on what “normal” and “useful” means. In this it is reflective of Daoism more broadly, which advocates for diversity in how we think about humanity and human achievements.Be prepared to question what we call ‘normal’Daoismresists what would today be considered an ableist approach to life. It teaches us that looking at life through an ableist lens only leads to negativity about those who are deemed “not good enough”. Such an approach looks for how people are deficient, rather than how they are capable.The Zhuangzi’s point is not that we cannot celebrate excellence. Instead, it champions the richness of life by showing that people can be excellent in many different ways. Its aim is not to tell us how to fix people’s medical and physiological conditions. Rather, prompts us to reflect on the shallow attitudes of those who see others as “disabled”, who want to draw attention to what some people lack, rather than what they might have.Consider what we mean by ‘disability’In a culture obsessed with positive thinking, can letting go be a radical act? | Nadine LevyRead moreThere isn’t a word in the Zhuangzi that means “disability”. Rather, the ancient textuses storytelling and exaggerated language to try to show how society characterises some people in derogatory ways. Stories about “sad horsehead humpback” or “hunchback limpleg” highlight that these are not labels that the men were born with; instead, they were given to these labels by a society that wrongly prides itself on “normalising” able-bodied people.Through these stories, we learn that sometimes the word “disability” is used unfairly to define people, so that our interactions with them are determined by the label.As the Zhuangzi shows, life is too important for us to take a one-size-fits-all approach to it. Its philosophy encourages us to embrace the richness of life by appreciating its diversity.Karyn Lai is a professor of philosophy in the faculty of arts, design and architecture at the University of New South WalesExplore more on these topicsDisabilityMaking sense of itPhilosophyReligioncommentShareReuse this content"

This is what Labour has left us withSamuel EarleBritain’s most talented opportunist now claims Reform is the ‘party of the workers’. He’s occupying terrain wilfully vacated by Keir StarmerSun 1 Jun 2025 10.44 EDTLast modified on Sun 1 Jun 2025 15.28 EDTShareIn amuch-publicised press conferencelast week in London, Nigel Farage invited Keir Starmer to a one-to-one debate at “a working man’s club” anywhere “in the red wall”. The suggested location was more noteworthy than the debate-me machismo. Its message was clear: having trampled over the Tories in the recent local elections, Reform UK is coming for Labour and nowhere is safe. “Let’s go to one of the former mining communities, let’s go somewhere that Labour has held the seat pretty much consistently since 1918,” Farage said, and then let’s “test” whether Labour or Reform is the real “party of the workers”. If Starmer felt brave enough, they could even “enjoy a few beers with the lads” – a nod to what has always been Farage’s favourite interpretation of what “standing with workers” entails.Farage’s speechmade waves for, among other things, calling for the two-child benefit cap to be overhauled and for Starmer’s restrictions to the winter fuel allowance to be reversed. For the Thatcherite fanboy and former City trader, these were unusual positions, and the Westminster lobby lapped up the controversy – suggesting that, for parts of the Tory press, deviations from austerity will only be permissible when delivered with Farageist chutzpah. “How Farage’s fiery speech signals a seismic shift in UK politics – and the end for Starmer,”the Daily Express declared. “Nigel leans left and hits the bullseye,”Tim Stanley cooedin the Daily Telegraph. The Sun wondered whether they should now call Farage “Red Nigel”.But in reality, rather than represent an unprecedented reconfiguration of British politics, the speech was a typically opportunistic and cynicalintervention from Farage: he noisily supported two policies that mounting reports suggested Labour were set to implement anyway, within a broader message that was far more George Osborne than Jeremy Corbyn. “The great divide that is opening up in British society,” Farage claimed, was between those who wake up early and go to work and those who stay in bed and enjoy a similar quality of life. Workers and shirkers, in other words – same as it ever was.How worried should Labour be by Reform’s overtures to the left? Farage’s star is clearly rising and Reform has already surpassed Ukip’s electoral achievements. Aftertriumphing in the recent local elections, with more than 670new council seatsand a third of the vote, Reform now leads the pack in many national opinion polls. But Labour should first and foremost be worried by itself. Starmer’s government appears to be in a permanently defensive state, commanding an enormous majority in parliament and yet rarely seeming to do more than react to events around it – sometimes left, often right. The prime minister’s personal approval rating has suffered the consequences of this hapless strategy, reaching record lows with38-point dropsince last year’s election. Meanwhile Red Nigel circles like a vulture.The two-child cap is illustrative. Since entering government with the promise of “change”, Labour maintained it would have to keep the policy – a transparently cruel inheritance from Osborne that made child poverty levels soar. Now the party appears increasingly likely to lift the cap, but what could have been a historic moment of rupture with Cruel Britannia – a move that will lifthalf a million children out of poverty, according to the Resolution Foundation – may easily be seen by the public as a reluctant concession to various Labour MPs and now Farage: not an empowered rebuttal of Tory austerity and the dawn of a new era, but yet more flip-flopping and an affirmation of Farage’s influence.In his speech, Farage claimed that Reform represented the biggest revolution in British politics sinceLabourovertook the Liberal party in the 1920s – and there are some parallels. Back then, the Tories saw Labour as both an existential threat and an opportunity: Labour was a foreboding movement, but the Tories could take fleeting comfort in the knowledge that it was the Liberals who would suffer the severest blow. Labour now treats Reform with a similar ambivalence: worried yet reassured that the Tories will be the main victim. But an irreverent and vengeful Farage, powered by grievances and resentment from both deindustrialised Britain and the elite, will have a far more corrosive effect on British politics and wider society than Labour ever threatened.For now, after the fallout of his “island of strangers” speech, Starmer’s strategy to deal with Reform will be tocall out its economics as a fantasy. Farage’s economic programme – binning net zero, waging war on asylum seekers and abolishing inheritance tax – is indeedreminiscent of Liz Truss. But it is not enough for Labour to play the role of the miserly Tories, saying to Reform what the Tories have historically said to them: we can’t afford that, we must live within our means, and so on. Labour needs its own positive vision of the country. For now, the party indulges its own set of fantasies: that it can outflank the Tories and even Reform on the right without being outflanked on the left; that it is enough to be the least unpopular party, no matter how uninspiring one is; and that you can break with the harsh inequities of Tory Britain, as promised, without upsetting anyone important.Before Starmer’s podiums were emblazoned with dispiriting slogans like “fixing the foundations” and “securing Britain’s future” they carried various versions of a more optimistic one: “it’s time for change.” A major reason for its massive majority in 2024 was that, after 14 years of joyless Conservative misrule, Labour better embodied that spirit of feeling than any other party. But unless Labour can show they are that change from the Tories – and that will involve taking Britain beyond its overfed interests in tightening immigration controls and the welfare state – this spirit of feeling will only endure and deepen, and the answer to it will no longer be Labour.Samuel Earle is the author of Tory Nation: How One Party Took OverExplore more on these topicsKeir StarmerOpinionLabourNigel FarageReform UKcommentShareReuse this content"

Now there’s a welcome recommendation to restore it across EnglandSun 1 Jun 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 1 Jun 2025 13.36 EDTShareChild health clinics, breastfeeding support, groups for new parents, sleep and weaning workshops, speech and language therapy, drop-in physio sessions, parenting courses in child development and mental health, stay and play sessions (including specifically for dads and male carers), music therapy classes, support groups for women and children who have suffered domestic violence, a housing clinic, groups for children with Send and cookery courses.These are just some of the services available to parents in the borough where I live: Islington, in north London. They exist under the banner of Bright Start, a clever – and I suspect slightly sneaky – rebranding of Sure Start. Sure Start was the Blair government’s leading early years policy, offering area-based holistic support to families with children under five in England (it was Flying Start in Wales and Best Start in Scotland). But since 2010, as a direct result of Tory austerity, 1,416 Sure Start centres in Englandhave closed. Now that the child poverty taskforce is to recommend to the Labour government areturn of the scheme, I thought that it was worth examining what it’s like to live in an area that kept it.I didn’t realise that Islington had retained Sure Start until I took my baby to be weighed at the local children’s centre after the necessity for home visits ceased. There it was, next to the reception desk: a sign reading “Sure Start”, evidence of what had once been a dedicated service for families not just here, but throughout England. Children’s centres offered all kinds of services like the ones listed above, and they also provided childcare to working parents, those in need and those entitled to the free government hours. In Islington, they still do. Of the three closest to where I live, two are rated “outstanding” and one is “good”.Childcare is in high demand in Islington, and childcare places aren’t allocated on the basis of a waiting list but on a complex calculation based on proximity, the age balance of the existing children in the room and staffing ratios. Priority childcare places exist for those who need them most: looked-after children, children whose families are homeless, children whose parents suffer from mental health problems, children with disabilities and other vulnerable groups. Health visitors and other professionals can refer these children to a panel for consideration. It’s one way in which the Bright Start services fulfil their remit of helping the most vulnerable families in the borough, an ethos that underpinned the very reason for Sure Start’s existence.I owe so much of my experience of early parenthood to Bright Start. As someone whose family does not live close, feeling part of a community has been vital to my wellbeing and to my son’s. Like many others, we do not own our flat and we live in an area where we are increasingly surrounded by millionaires (Islington has lots of very rich people in it, but also shocking levels of child poverty). That feeling of community becomes even more important in such a divided borough. Just knowing that there are people there who can help when things get tough means so much. In the three years since I had my son, we have accessed various forms of support, from health visitor advice to sleep and weaning workshops, not to mention some of the best therapy I have ever had.I highlight these things not to boast, but because it’s important to emphasise the postcode lottery of parenthood that exists in the UK. Were I a parent living in a borough without these services, I expect I would feel angry reading about the support that exists elsewhere, because everyone should have access to them. Many local authorities do their best and charities try to plug the gaps, but there is no replacement for fully integrated early years services. The Institute for Fiscal Studiesrecently foundthat the positive impacts of Sure Start were widespread and “remarkably long-lasting”, producing better health, education and social care outcomes for families who enrolled in the programme.It may sound obvious, but when services are integrated, they communicate better with one another. Referral pathways are more straightforward; professionals understand the systems they are working in and are able to signpost other services that might help specific children and their families, such as benefits and housing advice. If a child has a nursery place and needs an education, health and care plan for when they start school, the parents do not have to apply for this themselves. Supporting and safeguarding those who are vulnerable is less challenging because, with a proper safety net around them, people are less likely to drop off the map, or to feel that no one is looking out for them.Seeing how these services operate first-hand and benefiting from some of them has been, quite simply, amazing. That’s not to say the system is perfect: there are funding pressures and high demand, and gaps in services (to cite one example, Bright Start speech therapists don’t work with neurodivergent children, who are on a different pathway. As a result those children, who arguably need it most, don’t get any one-to-one speech therapy). Nevertheless, it should be a blueprint for Labour, which should reinstate the scheme throughout England.Certainly, it will be a challenge. Concerns raised by agovernment sourceinclude fragmentation of services and cost as barriers to reinstating Sure Start. Neither is a convincing argument. Reintegrating fragmented services may be a challenge, but that doesn’t mean it isn’t worth doing, and the payoff is worth it.IFS analysishas found that Sure Start children’s centres in England generated £2 of financial benefits for every £1 spent. We know that supporting the youngest in society from the outset means less pain, less social exclusion and less cost later on. More than that, it is simply the right thing to do. Senior Labour figures should visit one of Islington’s children’s centres and see for themselves how wonderful they are.Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsChildrenRepublic of ParenthoodParents and parentingFamilycommentShareReuse this content"

She talks about giving up medical training to pursue fiction – and the childhood memories that inspired her winning debut, The CoinSun 1 Jun 2025 08.00 EDTShareBuying a Birkin bag is not easy. You can’t just waltz into an Hermès store and pluck one off the shelf, even if you’re prepared to drop the many thousands required to pay for it. “The great majority of people are refused a Birkin, they get told that there aren’t any available in the store, which is a lie, they just don’t want to give it to them,” explains the protagonist of Palestinian writer Yasmin Zaher’s debut novelThe Coin, which this month won theSwansea University Dylan Thomas prizefor authors aged 39 or under.Zaher’s unnamed narrator, a Palestinian woman living in New York, has to get to grips with Hermès’s exclusive and elusive sales policies – which seem to privilege loyal customers – after being drawn into a Birkin reselling operation.The Birkin scheme is just a side quest, though; her day job is teaching in a school for underprivileged boys. But the protagonist’strueoccupation, in this quirky, unconventional novel, described by Elif Batuman as “bonkers” and Slavoj Žižek as a “masterpiece”, is cleaning: the meticulous, fanatical cleaning of her body and its surroundings.She develops a routine – which she calls a “CVS Retreat”, named after the US pharmacy chain – involving scrubbing and shaving every inch of her body with products and tools bought at the chemist in a process taking three to four hours, “about the average time it takes a New York lunatic to complete the marathon”.One spot she’s unable to clean with her Turkish hammam loofah is the square in the centre of her back. After one of her CVS Retreats, she begins to feel something “blazing and spinning” in that area, and believes it is a coin, a silver shekel, that she swallowed during a car ride as a child. Naturally, the coin becomes a fixation.“Obsession is a very good way to create a character’s downfall,” says Zaher. The writer herself has an “inherited obsession” with cleanliness, passed down from her mother and the other women in her family. Early in the novel, the narrator says that when you enter a woman’s house, “you never think of all the madness entailed” in making it “sparkling clean”.Fashion is is a tool for discrimination, classism and elitism – and I despise all of those thingsWorking on The Coin, Zaher became more intensely fixated on hygiene, and on fashion, with which she has a “love/hate” relationship. While Zaher feels “seduced” by fashion, “it’s also a tool for discrimination, for classism, for elitism, and I despise all of those things”.Zaher, 33, was born in Jerusalem, before leaving for Yale University at 17 to study biomedical engineering. “I come from a traditional culture. Writing wasn’t something that I thought was possible. So I went into the ‘minority path’: I studied science and I wanted to be a doctor, because that’s what people like me did. And at some point in my mid-20s, I had the courage to do what I actually wanted to do.”She went on to study creative writing at the New School, where she was advised by the novelistKatie Kitamura. She started writing The Coin after moving to New York, drawing on Clarice Lispector’s The Passion According to GH, about a woman who undergoes an existential crisis after crushing a cockroach in her apartment. Lispector “really inspired me to write wildly, to not think too much about what I was saying, about it making sense”, or about “morality”, says Zaher.She wrote the first draft “very quickly” – it was “so messy and so illogical and so strange” – and then spent six years editing it. Meanwhile, she worked as a journalist for the Israeli newspaper Haaretz and Agence France-Presse, covering mostly culture, and “obviously politics, because we have a lot of that”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

The character’s “initial standpoint”, says Zaher, “is that she’s going to America and she’s going to reinvent herself as this glamorous woman who has no past, no roots, no constraints on her”, but “her past and Palestine keep bubbling up to the surface”.The same happened to Zaher when she was writing the book: “I set out to write a novel that was fun, sexy, full of pleasures, and against my will, in a way, the past was coming up for me, and the painful present was coming up for me, and at some point I had to submit to that.” Although the character in New York is “totally fictional”, almost all of her childhood memories are Zaher’s real memories, including the swallowed coin.By the end of the novel, we learn that during the Nakba – the forced displacement of Palestinians during the 1948 Arab-Israeli war – the protagonist’s great-grandfather’s land was seized by Israelis. The Dylan Thomas prize’s ceremony happened to fall on Nakba Day, 15 May. Publication of The Coin marked a “lifelong dream” coming true, but it has also coincided with “one of the hardest years of my life”, she says.Being Palestinian “is a very dominant identity. You live with it all the time. You’re all the time being reminded of it, externally, internally. And even more so now,” says Zaher. “My fear is that the book gets attention because I’m Palestinian.” Yet the central character is not “this perfect victim that people expect to see in a novel written by a Palestinian writer”.Zaher instead sees her character as “almost a perpetrator”. She is often judgmental and rude, and her relationships with students are inappropriate (one boy, Jay, regularly helps clean her classroom; she begins leaving him money, and at one point kisses him on the forehead).Writing is about engaging in fantasy – it’s like an exploration of parts of us that we cannot live in real life“I don’t like novels where there are good people and bad people,” says Zaher. “I find that boring. I’m always attracted to novels that bring me closer to my bad, secret fantasies, my repressed bad qualities. I think it’s because reading is engaging in fantasy, and writing is also engaging in fantasy, so it’s an exploration of parts of us that we cannot live in real life.”Aside from Lispector, key literary inspirations have been Kurt Vonnegut – “he made me understand that there’s this thing called contemporary literature” and that you “don’t have to imitate the classics” – and Michel Houellebecq. “I really connect with the loneliness of his characters, and I think he’s a very courageous writer.”Zaher now lives in Paris, with her husband, whom she met while living in New York. She’s working on her next book, a “newsroom mystery” set in Jaffa and inspired by her time at Haaretz. Asked what impact the £20,000 prize, the UK’s most prestigious for young writers, might have on her work, she says she is generally a private person, and tries “to not think about these things”. But “it would be nice if the book would reach more people who really connect with it”.Is she still obsessive? “After seven years of being inside this novel, I think I’m a lot less clean than I used to be, and I also care about fashion a lot less. In a way it sort of healed me of my own obsessions.”The Coinby Yazmin Zaher is published by Footnote.To support the Guardian, order your copy atguardianbookshop.com.

But which maligned indie rockers will he stand up for?As told toRich PelleySun 1 Jun 2025 04.00 EDTShareThe first single I boughtBefore I became an indie kid and got into Arctic Monkeys, Maxïmo Park and Bloc Party, there was this explosion of British/south Asian music in the early 00s, so I bought Dance With You (Nachna Tere Naal) by Rishi Rich Project featuring Jay Sean and Juggy D from Tesco Extra. It felt like a moment for south Asians in the UK.The first song I fell in love withI grew up in a village in Cambridge and we’d always have BBC Asian Network or CDs of the latest Bollywood soundtracks playing. I loved Taal Se Taal Mila from the movie Taal; AR Rahman did the soundtrack, who went on to win an Oscar for Slumdog Millionaire. Taal means rhythm – the film is a musical and it encouraged me to learn the dilruba [a type of bowed sitar]. I only saw the movie once, but the visuals of the songs have stayed with me.The song I do at karaokeI’m not much of a karaoke guy. The one time I did it, I did Tribute by Tenacious D which is just such a fun, silly song. You can’t take karaoke too seriously.The song I inexplicably know every lyric toMy older sister bought Take a Look Around by Limp Bizkit from Mission: Impossible II. I loved the way they’d adapted the Mission: Impossible theme and turned it into metal rap. I can still do a fairly good job of reciting all the lyrics.The best song to play at a partyIf you don’t dance to September by Earth, Wind & Fire, there’s something wrong with you.The song I can no longer listen toMy kids are obsessed with Let It Go, so it gets massively overplayed in the car and the house. But I also maintain that the music from Frozen II is a lot better.The song I secretly likeIt’s not cool to like Coldplay. It felt like they were part of the indie and alternative music scene I liked before they decided to fill out stadiums and people didn’t like them any more. I know a lot of people who would turn their nose up at Princess of China, the one they did with Rihanna, but it’s a pretty good pop tune.The best song to have sex toSharpness by Jamie Woon is a very sexy song – although I can’t claim to have done that to it.The song that changed my lifeI was floored when I heard Nadia by Nitin Sawhney. His music impacted me in terms of bridging that gap between my identities as a British south Asian. It’s got this classical Indian vocal and then this huge drum’n’bass drop. It’s a perfect bit of music.The song that makes me cryChild of Mine by Laura Marling is a beautiful song about parenthood.The song I’d like played at my funeralUndercurrents, this beautiful piano piece by Dylan Phillips, the singer of one of my favourite bands, Half Moon Run. The image is one of a life lived and it’s just a beautiful piece of music.The Assessment is on Prime Video now.Explore more on these topicsMusicHonest playlistfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s amazing how radical that seemed back in 2002, with purists kicking off about how they were “supposed to shuffle”, and defenders pointing out that technically the 28 Days Later zombies weren’t really zombies.

The three-parter focuses on a mortuary scandal that one of his interviewees called “the ultimate incendiary point for which we now have massive regulations … regarding cremation”.Many who watch the piece may feel the same about their final arrangements as Rofé does concerning his. The Mortician is an exploration of a sprawling, twisted 1980s criminal case that vaulted the Lamb funeral home in Pasadena,California, and its co-proprietor David Sconce to national infamy amid charges of carrying out mass cremations at a ceramics kiln; stealing and selling corpses’ gold jewelry and dental fillings; stealing and selling corpses’ organs; delivering fake ashes to people mourning dead loved ones; and plotting violence against adversaries in the mortuary business.‘A new form of mass murder’: the terrifying, twisty unsolved mystery of the Tylenol killerRead moreThe series – debuting on Sunday – in part casts Sconce as an exceptionally malicious actor in a profession with mostly honorable practitioners. And his downfall led to industry reforms at protecting consumers of mortuary services in the US, including laws that allowed for crematorium inspections and made it a felony to furtively take dental gold or silver from corpses.But, as both The Mortician and a scan of news headlines establish,mortuaryscandalsthatechothe one centering on Sconce and the families with whom he did business persist. Rofé alluded to aguilty pleain April from a Colorado funeral home owner accused of keeping a dead woman’s body in a hearse for more than a year as well as improperly storing others’ cremated remains. His series nods to other relatively similar cases over the years in Georgia, Vermont, Tennessee and Texas.None of that is to say the mortuary industry is particularly vulnerable to attracting the proverbial bad apples, Rofé said. He remarked: “People do fucked up things in every business in the name of money.”Yet, he added, “as it relates to the business of death, it becomes a bit more grotesque” when that happens.And there’s so much grotesqueness in The Mortician that Rofé couldn’t find a place for one of the most disturbing anecdotes he said he has personally ever elicited in his career. It’s one that’s included directingLorena– examining the infamous case of the woman who cut off her husband’s penis with a kitchen knife in Virginia in 1993 – andBob Ross: Happy Accidents, Betrayal & Greed, which partially delved into a fight over the renowned landscape artist’s estate.The anecdote in question came from Louis Quinones, who used to drive a van that retrieved bodies for Sconce’s mortuary to cremate. Quinones recalled how one day he was in a cold storage room where the mortuary kept bodies on shelves, and he instinctively kicked a blanket on the floor aside that he believed had been left there haphazardly. But he felt there was something under the blanket, which he removed and discovered was the corpse of a baby.Quinones told Rofé that he looked at the name written on the baby’s ankle tag – and realized that he had delivered what was supposed to be the infant’s ashes weeks earlier to the child’s mother after she had paid for a cremation.“That is another level of depravity,” said Rofé, who also madeSasquatch, which zeroed in on a mythical monster and a murder.But there was no space for that recollection from Quinones in a series that spends a total of about 180 minutes recounting how Sconce first cornered the cremation market in his community by charging just $55 a body, undercutting the competition. The funeral home he owned and ran alongside his parents then went from conducting fewer than 195 cremations in 1981 to more than 25,280 just five years later – inviting a law enforcement investigation that uncovered the brutal, illegal shortcuts he took to register that increase in volume of about 12,860%.It was impossible at that rate for the mortuary to determine whose ashes belonged to whom. So it handed ashes back to client families at random – which they had no idea about for years.Furthermore, investigators determined that, to maximize his profits, Sconce abided by his mortuary’s taking – and selling – everything from rings and clothes to eyeballs, hearts and livers. Those efforts required the mutilation of bodies and had not received permission from people who had entrusted Sconce to care for their dead.View image in fullscreenDavid Sconce in The Mortician.Photograph: HBOThe details of Sconce’s legal fate – including in connection with criminal charges that he killed the owner of a rival mortuary – are out there for those who are so inclined to find out ahead of The Mortician’s airing. But suffice to say he went on to a series of incarcerations from which he was paroled. That parole happened as Rofé researched Sconce’s story in archived newspaper articles and weighed retelling it in a docuseries styled after theLos Angelesnoir films the director said he devoured after moving to the city at the beginning of his career.He picked out Sunset Boulevard, DOA, The Long Goodbye, Chinatown and Mulholland Drive. The Mission Revival-style mortuary inextricably tied to Sconce would have been at home appearing in any of them.‘These murders still live with me’: the show that goes inside Fred and Rose West’s ‘house of horrors’Read moreRofé and his team, mostly based in LA and New York, had two days’ notice that Sconce was being released from a prison in Sacramento, California. But they got there in time to greet him at the prison gates and subsequently capture whatHBObilled as the first – and evidently only – interview Sconce had given since his parole, making it an easy decision for him to finish what became The Mortician.Some of the comments Sconce offered have already made the news. “To me commingling of ash is not a big deal,” Sconce says in one rant on The Mortician, an excerpt of which was in a trailer clip that drew media coverage. “I don’t put any value in anybody after they’re gone and dead – as they shouldn’t when I’m gone and dead. That’s not a person any more.”He continued: “That’s not your loved one any more. And it never has been. Love them when they’re here. Period.”Rofé couldn’t discuss much of his interview with Sconce without spoiling the series for prospective viewers. But what he could say is he was gripped with how Sconce shifted from demonstrating himself to be “the king of deflection” – even with respect to things that court documents presented as proven facts – to “being so upfront about other incredibly disturbing things that you couldn’t believe somebody was not only coping to but trying to rationalize as something that there’s nothing wrong with”.“And I still can’t believe some of the things he said on camera,” Rofé said. “If you [are] shocked watching, do understand that I was shocked having it said to me in person.”The Mortician begins on HBO on 1 June with a UK date to be announcedExplore more on these topicsDocumentaryHBOLos AngelesUS crimeFactual TVCaliforniaWest CoastfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Picture Post’s unique characteristic was that it was accessible to all, but did not patronise the ordinary people whose lives were reflected in its pages.The magazine documented the postwar social change that resulted from the Beveridge report of 1942. Among other examples, Chillingworth contributed images of a social worker in Nelson, Lancashire, in 1954, showing her engaged in the delicate task of combing out the newly washed hair of an elderly woman. As if in contrast, he followed up with a feature on elegant fashion models in Paris and London. A picture of the Leigh rugby player “Nebby” Cleworth at work as a labourer on a weekday between games celebrated the dignity of labour rather than the glamour of winning a match.View image in fullscreenChillingworth at work on a beach, August 1952.Photograph: Daniel Farson/Getty ImagesChillingworth delighted in a sense of place and character, encountering the specific in the general, and local identity in a capital city. He developed a naturalistic style, and was able to pass unnoticed on assignment. Elements of the past often entered his photo stories, however contemporary. Jewish Whitechapel (1952) shows a news agency, its windows boarded and broken and an ad for the Jewish Evening News painted on the frontage, too high to deface. Nearby is a Jewish tailor’s shop beside a large advert for a local theatre company, its text in Hebrew, offering the real sense of a distinct London community.Although he worked at Picture Post for only a short time – around nine years, on and off – it was an important period for Chillingworth. During the 1990s, when he regularly visited the Centre for Journalism Studies at Cardiff University, where I was working at the time, his conversation remained focused on his time at Picture Post and its “family” of photojournalists.View image in fullscreenRugby player “Nebby” Cleworth working as a labourer between games, 17 December 1949.Photograph: John Chillingworth/Getty ImagesBorn in the working-class district of Upper Holloway, north London, Chillingworth shared and understood the background of many of his subjects. His father, John, was an official with the National Union of Journalists. His mother, Georgina (nee Winterbourn, and known as “Mabs”), was a housewife. The eldest of four children, John attended St Mary’s Church of England primary school in Hornsey, then St David and St Catherine’s secondary, which he left, like many of his peers, aged 15.Although he scarcely knew what the job would involve, he signed up soon afterwards as Picture Post’s tea maker. On finding the darkroom more interesting than the office kitchen, he began spending his spare time learning and assimilating all he could.Picture Post photographers generally brought their camera films to be developed in the office. Alongside and observing the likes of Bill Brandt, Thurston Hopkins, Merlyn Severn and Bert Hardy, and a growing influx of émigré photographers including Gerti Deutsch, Felix Man (Baumann) and Kurt Hutton (Hübschmann), Chillingworth was an eager and adept tutee. Hutton in particular took Chillingworth under his wing, encouraging him to experiment with a camera, and remaining a lasting friend and mentor. Through Hutton, Chillingworth acquired the skill of passing unobserved in a crowd. Like him, he transitioned to becoming a staffer rather than an occasional contributor.According to the author and publisher Dewi Lewis in his monograph John Chillingworth: Picture Post Photographer (2013): “He was soon producing a vast range of photo stories of a very high quality. Encouraged by Picture Post’s legendary editor Tom Hopkinson, Chillingworth learned to combine “storytelling” images with the written word, and worked with some of the finest magazine journalists of the age.View image in fullscreenA 1954 Chillingworth photo of a social worker with her elderly client.Photograph: John Chillingworth/Getty ImagesHaving been too young to serve during the second world war, in 1946 he undertook national service with the Royal Engineers, returning to Picture Post’s office in Holborn in 1949. He left only a year before its demise in 1957.A picture taken of Chillingworth by Dan Farson on a beach in 1956 shows him clad only in shorts under a burning sun. All Chillingworth is wearing above the waist are a pair of cameras: a Leica strung around his neck and a Rolleiflex around his midriff. It is a fine example of Hutton’s advice taken to heart: a high-speed Leica for shots taken of moving or changing subjects; a weightier Rollei to capture a portrait, pose or perspective taken with careful preparation.On leaving Picture Post, he continued his photographic career as a freelancer. He established his own business and freelanced abroad, in locations from Japan and Laos to Siberia and India, on commissions for the press as well as major industrial and advertising clients. Later he became visual communication partner in an advertising consultancy, and a marketing consultant for the Hulton picture archive (now incorporated into Getty Images), which holds images for more than 400 of the picture stories featured in Picture Post.In 1989 a selection of Chillingworth’s work was exhibited in 150 Years ofPhotographyat the National Science and Media Museum in Bradford. In the same year he was made an honorary fellow of the Royal Photographic Society, described as “one of the makers of photographic history”.He is survived by his third wife, Ros (nee Taylor), whom he married in 1987, five children from two earlier marriages, five grandchildren and three great-grandchildren, and his sister, Ann.John Chillingworth, photographer, born 18 January 1928; died 6 April 2025Explore more on these topicsPhotographyMagazinesobituariesShareReuse this content"

First premiering in 2013, its domestic fallouts might have been unconventional fare to set to song then. But it all seems rather soft and cuddly in its comedy now.Family members are slightly too recognisable in their traits: a middle-aged father (Michael Jibson) who has taken up free-running and never reads the instructions for his wonky DIY; a put-upon mother (Gemma Whelan) who senses her marriage has hit an iceberg; a bossy grandmother (Gay Soper) showing signs of dementia and a wacky aunt decked out in animal-print (Victoria Elliott) undergoing a mid-life sexual awakening.Also, most importantly, 13-year-old Nicky (Nancy Allsop), the youngest of the family and sister to stroppy teen Matt (Luke Lambert). She is our singing narrator, desperate to unite the parts of family life that are spinning out of control and away from each other. To that end, she writes a sort of wish-fulfilment essay on her “perfect family” which wins her a holiday. She chooses camping, in the woods where her parents met as teenagers, to take them back to the beginning.View image in fullscreenOut of the woods … Victoria Elliott and Gay Soper.Photograph: Mark SeniorDirected by Vicky Featherstone, they emerge out of what seems like a giant doll’s house, as if to send up Nicky’s “perfect family” premise. The woodland in which they camp – beautifully evoked by set designer Chloe Lamford – bears the enchanted quality of Shakespeare’s forest of Arden. There is no magic but comic shenanigans and inner transformations which are sweet, if predictable. All family tension and sadness is conveniently smoothed and remedied by the end.Song is what elevates the musical above a TV comedy. Characters confess inner turmoil or unhappiness in tune, set against a delicate harp and cellos. They also sing lines over and across each other, to mirror the crossed emotional wires between them. Whelan’s numbers ooze wry humour, Allsop has a wonderful singing voice, and the few choral numbers soar. This family – a paragon of middle-English emotional repression – become open-hearted and vulnerable when they sing. It’s twee, and a little slow in getting there, but the happy ending does melt your heart.This Is My Family is atSouthwark Playhouse Elephant, Londonuntil 12 JulyExplore more on these topicsStageTheatreMusicalsreviewsShareReuse this content"

From pre-indictment stakeout to arraignment to jury verdict to sentencing, he covered the legal tribulations of the once and future president, a drama for the ages in a courthouse in lower Manhattan. Dragon on Centre Street is his eyewitness account.A former style section writer, Bromwich is mindful of human folly. His first book captures the personalities that filled the corridors of the courthouse and the streets around it, light-hearted one moment, deadly serious the next.“The first clash between Trump and the criminal court system was shaping up to be the entertainment event of the season,” Bromwich writes, with a touch of glee.The run-up to the arraignment assumed the air of a rock concert or a sports championship. In the words of one Times stringer, it was “hotter than Springsteen”.View image in fullscreenDragon on Centre Street by Jonah Bromwich.Photograph: Simon & Schuster“Professional line sitters, from a company called Same Ole Line Dude, showed up wearing merch advertising the name of their company and toting colorful tents,” Bromwich goes on.Pages later, he introduces the reader to Max Azzarello, a name now largely forgotten: “On 7 April 2024, 12 days before he killed himself outside a Manhattan courthouse, [he] ambled downstairs to his neighbors’ apartment in St Augustine, Florida, holding a fistful of glow sticks.” Max and a friend, Mandy, wanted to gain the attention of a family of bats who circled overhead, much as the two had played with a pair of stray cats and a toy alligator. “Cat fishing”, they called it.But after the death of his mother in 2022, Max’s life had turned dark. Less than two weeks later, in a park across from the court in New York, the 37-year-oldset himself on fire.Bromwich’s descriptions are insightful – at times, withering.“His color, created for the camera, looks strange at close range,” he writes of Trump at his arraignment, in April 2023. “So does his hair, coiffed in the front but threadbare in the back, such that someone sitting behind him for weeks at a time sees a different patch of his scalp each day.”But Bromwich also gives Trump his due: “In person, it was easier to see the fundamentals – how tall he was, how imposing – and to sense the way his charisma exerted pressure on those around him.”The competing versions of Trump occupied the same space at the same time.Elsewhere, Bromwich conveys the judgment of Olivia Nuzzi, then a writer for New York magazine, in timetabloid fodderin her own right. Watching the trial on the court’s closed-circuit television system, he describes her as “blown away” by the visuals. “Stripped of his power, Trump was reduced to a small garish human trapped in the municipal monochrome of the courtroom,” he writes, summarizing what she saw.Bromwich recounts the trial testimony of Stormy Daniels, born Stephanie Clifford, the adult film star whom Trump paid to keep quiet about the affair she claimed and he denied. Before Daniels took the stand, Sally Franklin, a vice-president at Penguin Random House, read “telling” excerpts of Trump’s books.“The defense looked stressed,” Bromwich writes. “There was no doubt that Stormy had enraged Trump, and it was an open question whether he could keep himself in check, even with the threat of jail hanging over his head.”Daniels testified that she spanked Trump. He mouthed “bullshit”.Isabelle Brourman, a courtroom artist, sketched Trump getting his butt swatted. The show continued. Trump had said she ought to be a contestant on The Apprentice, Daniels said. After all, Daniels reminded him of Ivanka, his daughter: smart, beautiful and underestimated.“The dizzying feeling in the courtroom was increasing … in the gallery, Eric Trump was slowly turning from pale to pink,” Bromwich observes.Donald Trump cursed and shook his head. Juan Merchan, the trial judge, warned Todd Blanche, Trump’s counsel, his client could be held in contempt.“I’ll talk to him,” Blanche said. In all, the court fined Trump $9,000 for contempt and another $1,000 for violating a gag order.Ivanka and Melania, Trump’s third wife, never appeared in court. Ditto Jared Kushner, Ivanka’s husband, once Donald Trump’s chief White House adviser. On the other hand, Trump was supported by the likes of Mike “Moses” Johnson, the House speaker; JD Vance, then a senator from Ohio, eventually Trump’s vice-president; and a phalanx of future cabinet members.“Those guests who populated the left side of the gallery in [the courtroom] were quickly drafted into Trump’s administration,” Bromwich writes.Susie Wiles is chief of staff. Doug Burgum is secretary of the interior. Kash Patel leads the FBI.Trump’s lawyers fared well, too. Blanche is deputy attorney general. Emil Bove is principal associate deputy attorney general, and on Wednesday, Trump nominated him to the US court of appeals for the third circuit, which covers Delaware, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. Maryanne Trump, the president’s late sister, once sat on that bench.

In January 2025, as he waited to return to power, he faced sentencing.“The fact is that I’m totally innocent,” Trump announced, via computer.Merchan handed down an unconditional discharge.

This is my ART.” Then he holds his mic to his crotch and waggles it. Yep – same old Robbie.After eccentric diversions into film andvisual arts, the pop star’s grand return to stadium shows begins with a philosophical bent: a sombre video critiques the impact of technology on the pop sphere, replete with a deepfake Elvis, and implies that only one man – perhaps one with a whopping 15 No 1 albums – could possibly save the industry. As campy and braggadocious as he’s ever been, after 35 years in the biz Williams crowns himself the “King of Entertainment” and tonight is not a mere show but a “journey”.Robbie Williams: Radical Honesty review – ‘Tone deaf, self-important, incredibly bad art’Read moreThat journey involves: Williams bathing flirtatiously in a handsy audience; T-shirts chucked out during Old Before I Die, of all the songs to choose; belting Take That’s Relight My Fire with sparkly guest Michelle McManus. He even dives off a pyro-laden bridge to hang suspended by his ankles, in a visual tribute to his biggest-selling album Escapology. Less fun: the lengthy skits with yet more deepfakes, and some tedious preaching about “embracing our inner cringe”.Throughout, Williams closely monitors our progress: “That was really good,” he confirms, with a cocky shrug, after a psychedelic performance of Kids. “I got goose bumps!” he grins, when the crowd bellows the chorus of Sexed Up. After a flamboyant Rock DJ, with the Broadway-style arrangement from the Better Man soundtrack: “I’m shitting out hits!”But the meta narrative works best when it goes unsaid. Finishing on My Way, a swinging big-band moment with cacophonous brass, Williams has the superstar glow of a man living up to that regal title. The encore then begins with Feel, a song which stares bleakly at “the role [he’s] been given” and for the first time Williams is utterly sombre. The contrast is genuinely moving.“Are you not entertained?” he roars gladiatorially, as we karaoke to Angels. Of course we are! Tonight’s frenzied, overcompensating maximalism could indicate a dash of insecurity or total, outrageous confidence. As with all things Robbie, it’s probably both.Explore more on these topicsRobbie WilliamsEdinburghreviewsShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Off toTownthis week, on Drury Lane. Yes, a restaurant called Town, one word, so a bit of a challenge to find online. Then again, perhaps by the time you’re as experienced and beloved a restaurateur as Stevie Parle, formerly ofDock Kitchen,Craft,Sardine,PalatinoandJoy, your regular clientele will make the effort to find you. Parle’s shtick, roughly speaking, is thoughtful, high-end Mediterranean cooking and warm, professional hospitality, so the longer I thought about him opening a new place in London’s theatre heartland and calling it just Town, the more it made sense.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Yes, Town may be up at the less pretty end of this famous road, next door to a Travelodge and in the shadow of the lesser-knownGillian Lynne theatre, but whenever I hear the words “Drury Lane”, I’m whisked back to the impossible glamour of the start of theRoyal Variety Performanceon the BBC and people in tiaras exiting Rolls-Royces. Drury Lane, the commentator used to say, was the glitzy epicentre of London town, and Parle’s new restaurant certainly captures some of the essence of that yesteryear ritz. It’s a big, beautiful, ballsy, expensive-looking beast; a sleek, capacious, ever-so-slightly Austin Powers-esque, shiny-floored, caramel-coloured pleasure palace. It has a vivid, neon-green brightly lit open kitchen and thick 3D burgundy wall tiles that speak of expensive ceramic deliveries from the genre of Italian supplier that makesKevin McCloudclutch his face and sigh, “Well, this spells problems for the budget.”View image in fullscreenTown’s fried sage leaves: a signature dish that comes drizzled with heather honey.Thankfully, the budget for Town’s decor – and how many portions of deep-fried sage leaves they need to sell to recoup it – is not my problem. All I know is that I was having a jolly old time from the second I sat down to sip on a naked flame non-alcoholic cocktail while feeling like Princess Michael of Kent circa 1988 hiding from a Royal Command Performance. And that was before I’d even glanced at the menu to choose between Town’s cod and clam curry with mussels, rhubarb and ghee flatbread and the Welsh lobster with lardo and house XO sauce, or indeed found room for the morello cherry clafoutis with thick cream.Town’s menu, I should warn you, is not for anyone with a meek appetite, or those hoping for a Slimming World Body Magic award by the summer. Example: the fresh, warm potato sourdough from the “snacks” section of the menu comes with a bowl of bone marrow dipping gravy. Order Parle’s signature fried sage leaves, and they’ll arrive drizzled with heather honey. If you attempt to hide away with the 100-Acre radishes, they come in a thick puddle of miso hummus. This restaurant is a feeder. Other snacks are the likes of gildas, caviar with homemade beef fat crisps andCoombeshead’s cured mangalitsa shoulder.View image in fullscreen‘Eminently devourable’: Town’s ‘sublime’ Kashmiri saffron risotto with roasted bone marrow.Initially, I suspected that Town might be a pre-theatre restaurant designed to scoop up tourists in search of a deal, but it turns out that the food is far too good to rush through in an hour. And anyway, does anyone really want to sit through two and a half hours of Much Ado About Nothing after devouring a whopping great portion of sublime Kashmiri saffron risotto with yet more bone marrow, or a huge pork chop with seasonal onions, a rich, burnt apple sauce and hot mustard? Both of those dishes were finely executed, eminently devourable and teetering on the edge of a bit bloody much. We shared a side of beef fat pink fir potatoes that held good on their promise, because each one came enrobed in thick, bottom-of-the-tin, Sunday lunch-style beef fat.Right now, Town is manageably quiet, but it won’t be for long, and nor should it be. Service is bright, crisp, clever and unobtrusive, and the prices are, dare I say, reasonable by London standards these days. There are a hundred places where the hopeful theatreland diner can be ripped off in this postcode, but Town to me is already a trusted friend.View image in fullscreen‘The star of the show’: Town’s morello cherry clafoutis is served with ‘much, much too much clotted cream’ (not that anyone’s complaining).Photograph: Amy Heycock/The GuardianThe dessert menu offers no let-up on the excess, extra thought and ecstasy, either. We shared a single scoop of pale green Uji matcha ice-cream festooned in crunchy brittle and perched in a pool of sweet miso caramel. Then, the star of the show, a hot-from-the-oven, damp, sticky cherry clafoutis served with much, much too much clotted cream. Parle has taken to theatreland with another sterling performance: a great first act, a strong middle section and a thoroughly satisfying denouement. Unmissable.

Thick and comfortingly creamy, it might feel a tad wintry were it not for the sweet, briny clams, which sing of sea breezes and sunshine. Though the name derives from the Frenchchaudière, or cauldron, chowder is New England through and through, and best eaten in the fresh air, whether that’s in Cape Cod or Capel-le-Ferne.Prep40 minSoak20 minCook30 minServes42kg live clams, or defrosted in-shell frozen clamsSalt and black pepper200g thick unsmoked bacon, or pancetta1 onion2 medium waxy potatoes1 bay leaf2 tbsp plain flour150ml double or whipping creamA knob of butter1 A note on the clamsView image in fullscreenThough they’re abundant along our coastline, clams aren’t terribly popular in this country. Fishmongers and some supermarkets (eg Morrisons) often have live clams; they can also be found online, and in the freezer section of bigger supermarkets and in Asian food stores. Unfortunately, US-style tinned clams in juice aren’t that widely available in the UK, and seeing as it’s those cooking juices that make this dish, Italian jarred clams in brine don’t really work here.2 Purge the clamsView image in fullscreenTo prepare the clams, discard any with broken shells and give the rest a good scrub. If using live clams, rather than frozen and defrosted ones, put them in a large bowl or sink, fill with very salty (like the sea) water and soak for at least 20 minutes to filter out any sand. Repeat if necessary, but I’ve never had to do this.3 Wash the clamsDrain the clams, get rid of any grit they’ve ejected, then put them in a large bowl or sink of fresh water to expunge any excess salt while you prepare the remaining ingredients. If you’re using defrosted frozen raw clams, give the shells a quick onceover for cleanliness and skip to step 4.4 Make a start on the chowder baseView image in fullscreenCut the bacon into smallish dice – unsmoked is traditional here, and smoked will give the dish an entirely different flavour profile. Either way, try to use thick-cut bacon, because those wafer-thin rashers increasingly favoured by supermarkets tend to disappear in soup. Peel and finely chop the onion, and wash and chop the potatoes into roughly 1cm dice (no need to peel them first, unless they’re particularly filthy).5 Cook the clamsView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenDrain the clams, then put them in a large pan with 600ml water. Cover, bring to a boil, cook until they’re all open, then tip into a colander set over a bowl to catch the liquid. When the clams are cool enough to handle, take the meat out of the shells (discard any that remain resolutely shut tight).6 Measure the brothView image in fullscreenYou probably won’t need to chop the picked clams, because those sold in this country tend to be far smaller than American ones, but roughly chop the clams if any are on the large side. Strain the clam cooking liquor through a couple of layers of paper towel (or cheesecloth), then measure it and add enough water to bring it up to 1.2 litres.7 Fry the bacon and onionsView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenPut a medium saucepan on a medium heat, then gently fry the bacon in its own fat until it begins to render. Add the onion, fry until soft, then turn up the heat slightly. Once both the onion and bacon are beginning to colour, add the bay leaf and flour, and cook, stirring, for a couple of minutes.8 Add the liquid and clamsView image in fullscreenPour in the clam liquid bit by bit, stirring to dissolve the flour, then add the chopped potatoes and simmer for about 10 minutes, until tender. Stir in the cream, clams and butter. Season to taste with salt, if necessary, and plenty of black pepper, then serve immediately, ideally with a large hunk of bread (or if you’re on the US west coast,in a sourdough bowl).9 And if making in advance …If you’re making the soup base ahead of time, don’t add the clams (or the cream and butter, for that matter) until you reheat the base, because overcooking will make the clams rubbery (keep the meat in the fridge until needed). Similarly, if you know you’ve made too much base, freeze the excess before adding the clams and dairy to the pot (you can freeze the clam meat separately).Felicity Cloake’s new book, Peach Street to Lobster Lane: Coast to Coast in Search of Real American Cuisine, is published next week by HarperCollins at £16.99.
