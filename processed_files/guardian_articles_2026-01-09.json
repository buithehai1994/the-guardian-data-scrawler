And our critic thinks he has just worked it outJonathan JonesFri 9 Jan 2026 10.43 ESTLast modified on Fri 9 Jan 2026 10.50 ESTShareIncreased security after the recent heist has made the queues at the Louvre even slower, yet on this rainswept, very wintry morning, no one grumbles. After all, the Mona Lisa is waiting inside for all these tourists who have come from the world over. Leonardo da Vinci’s woman – swathed in dark cloth and silk, smiling enigmatically as she sits in front of a landscape of rocks, road and water – draws crowds like no other painting. But if the Mona Lisa can attract such attention fully clothed, what would the queues be like if she was nude?Strangely, this is not just amusing speculation – because in 18th-century Britain, she was. An engraving issued by a publisher called John Boydell gave libertine Georgians the opportunity to hang “Joconda” in their boudoir. It must have been popular because many copies survive. This Mona Lisa sits in a chair with her hands crossed in front of a fading view of distant rock formations. And, like the Mona Lisa in the Louvre, she smiles enigmatically. But there is one key difference.She is naked from the waist up.Horace Walpole thought his father Robert, who was Britain's first Prime Minister, had the actual Mona LisaThe print has a caption saying this is a reproduction of the painting by “Lionardo da Vinci” that hangs “in the Gallery at Houghton”. Today, Houghton Hall in Norfolk stages contemporary art on its lawns, but back then it was famous for the oil paintings amassed by its owner, Britain’s first and most corrupt Prime Minister, Sir Robert Walpole. The Houghton collection was catalogued by his son Horace, then 26, who apparently thought his father’s “Joconda”, on which this engraving was based, was the actual Mona Lisa: “The Joconda, a Smith’s Wife, reckon’d the handsomest Woman of her Time: She was Mistress to Francis I, King of France; by Lionardo da Vinci. She would often sit half naked, with Musick, for several Hours together, to be drawn by him.”This image of the king of France’s lover posing for hours “half naked” while musicians played is an interesting twist on the first account we have of the Mona Lisa, published in 1550 by the Florentine architect and artist Giorgio Vasari. To elicit that smile, Vasari says, Leonardo “always employed, while he was painting her portrait, persons to play or sing, and jesters, who might make her merry”. Posing only half dressed, she would need plenty of distractions.View image in fullscreenGlobal pulling power … visitors viewing the Mona Lisa in the Louvre.Photograph: Manish Swarup/APYou won’t find the nude Joconda at Houghton today. In 1779, Walpole’s art collection was sold to Catherine the Great and today it hangs at the Hermitage in St Petersburg, the nude Mona Lisa no longer attributed to Leonardo butto one of his unnamed 16th-century followers. Yet, if the work is by a Leonardo imitator, was there a nude Mona Lisa by him to imitate? And if there was, why did Leonardo paint it and for whom? It is one of the most tantalising, and entertaining, mysteries in art – and I think I may have solved it.First, we need to go to the Loire, where Leonardo spent his final years as French royal artist. It was here that the artist himself left a fascinating clue. In October 1517, he had visitors to his chateau: Cardinal Luigi of Aragon and his cleric Antonio de Beatis. Leonardo – “the most outstanding painter of our day”, records De Beatis – showed them three paintings, all hanging today in the Louvre. Two were religious: John the Baptist and The Virgin and Child With St Anne. The other was “a certain Florentine woman portrayed from life at the request of the late Magnificent Giuliano de’ Medici”.It is generally accepted that they were being shown the Louvre Mona Lisa. But they don’t seem to have been told the truth by Leonardo: this Mona Lisa was not painted for Giuliano de’ Medici (and despite Horace Walpole’s imaginings, certainly not for the king of France).Leonardo added so many touches to the Mona Lisa that she had become in his mind someone else, his dreamA document in Heidelberg University proves this painting was begun in Florence in 1503, some 14 years before these chateau visitors saw it. It was a portrait of Lisa del Giocondo, wife of merchant Francesco del Giocondo, just as Vasari wrote (hence its various alternative names, La Gioconda/Gioconde/Joconde/Joconda). Mona is short for Monna, the polite way to address a married woman in Renaissance Florence. Lisa, being middle class, would be addressed as Mona Lisa.So why did Leonardo mention Giuliano de’ Medici, the youngest son of Lorenzo the Magnificent, de facto ruler of the Florentine Republic? He certainly did not paint the clothed Mona Lisa for Giuliano – but maybe Leonardo was telling a truth of sorts. Perhaps he painted the naked version for the nobleman.On 24 September 1513, Leonardo left Milan, then his base, for Rome, bound for the Belvedere in the papal palace where he was given a studio by Giuliano de’ Medici, whose older brother had just become pope. It was a chance for Leonardo to live in style and paint in the city where Michelangelo and Raphael were at work.The pope didn’t trust him with frescoes, but Leonardo may have done something more intimate for Giuliano. In a chateau in Chantilly, just north of Paris, there is a mysterious “cartoon” – the term given to a full-scale preparatory drawing that would have chalk pushed through it to mark a canvas. This cartoon, dated 1514-16, portraysthe same nude model featured in the Houghton paintingand has unmistakable allusions to the Mona Lisa. After technical analysis, the Louvre announced in 2017 that there was strong evidence that it was at least partly by Leonardo, done with the left hand.The claim becomes all the more convincing if you look hard, particularly at the drapery that has his free and infinite suggestiveness. The woman, whose upper body is naked, sits in a wooden chair with her left forearm horizontal, turned side-on to the viewer just like the Louvre’s Mona Lisa. Similarly, she has also placed her right hand over her left wrist. Even the spread and shading of her fingers is identical. The Mona Lisa’s hands may not be central to her fame today, but in Renaissance Italy their elegant positioning was widely imitated.View image in fullscreenUnmistakable allusions … the nude Mona Lisa ‘cartoon’ at the Domaine de Chantilly, with her elegantly positioned hands.Photograph: Michel Urtado/AFP/Getty ImagesThe artist who drew the Chantilly nude doesn’t just emulate all that, but replicates itperfectly. This would be easy – if you had access to Leonardo’s studio, or if you actually were Leonardo. And the Mona Lisa was with him in Rome, just as it would be in France. He never gave it to Lisa’s husband. Its size – just 77cm by 53cm – made it easy to transport on his restless sojourns. One reason why he may have no longer have thought of this as a portrait of Mona Lisa, when he talked to his Loire visitors, is because it no longer was: he’d added so many touches over the years, transfiguring the original, that she’d become in his mind someone else, his dream.So the creator of the Houghton painting must have worked from the Chantilly sketch, or from a nude painting based on it. In other words, it seems highly probable that Leonardo, perhaps helped by his pupils, painted this nude Mona Lisa.But is there any more evidence? I believe I’ve found a crucial clue hanging in plain sight in the Barberini Palace in Rome: a “half-naked” portrait by Leonardo’s young admirer Raphael. The Rome in which Leonardo was living was lavishly hedonist, with handsome Raphael its star. Raphael and his team were creating a sensual heated bathroom for the papal palace, adorning it with frescoes. Raphael also decorated the party palace of the pope’s banker Agostino Chigi. Vasari claims that when Raphael was frescoing there, he required his mistress to live with him. His early death was supposedly caused by sexual exhaustion.Around 1520, Raphael portrayeda young woman sitting in a garden with her top off. She smiles sideways as she holds a translucent piece of silk over her belly. Her breasts and arms are bare, except for a blue armband that says in gold letters: “Raphael of Urbino.” The painting is known as La Fornarina, The Baker’s Daughter, after a legend that Raphael’s girlfriend’s dad was a baker.When I was investigating the decadent delights of high Renaissance Rome recently, I realised with a shock that this work is basically a nude Mona Lisa. That little smile echoes Leonardo’s masterpiece. She sits calmly, her eyes and nose as clearly defined as Leonardo’s model, sporting transparent silk like the veil that covers the Mona Lisa’s head. Francesco del Giocondo was a silk merchant and that may be why Leonardo draped her in the material, while also being enchanted by the optical possibilities. Both these “half naked” women, in Horace Walpole’s words, sit with their clothes around them, thrown off.The nude Mona Lisa was a grenade chucked into the Renaissance – it radicalised the way artists painted bodiesThe similarities are just too close for coincidence. Raphael is an impeccable artist but not as wildly original as Leonardo. Instead, he learned from his elder, imitating the Mona Lisa ever since he saw it in an early state in Florence around 1504. This gregarious, courtly artist would have visited Leonardo at the Belvedere and seen his latest stunning idea, the nude Mona Lisa. Did Leonardo paint it as well as sketch it? The painting owned by Robert Walpole is clearly based on the Chantilly drawing but adds a rocky blue landscape, one that’s typical of late Leonardo works. The rock formations have the same pale blue shade as the mountains in The Virgin and Child With St Anne.The nude Mona Lisa was like a grenade chucked into the high Renaissance. It instantly radicalised the way artists painted bodies. The otherwise conservative Raphael’s bold Fornarina spread this revolution. The model who posed for La Fornarina also posed naked for Raphael’s chief assistant, Giulio Romano, whose art mixes classicism with what it’s fair to call pornography: he created a visual sex guide called I Modi (“The Ways”) that illustrates 16 love-making positions. Titian and Correggio took up the challenge to paint sensual nudes.View image in fullscreen‘The similarities are just too close for coincidence’ … Raphael’s La Fornarina, or The Baker’s Daughter.Photograph: Marco Di Lauro/Associated PressA number of paintings by Leonardo are lost, especially those that scandalised the devout. They include his erotic Leda and the Swan, believed to have been destroyed by a shocked French royal. This painting of a woman and her swan lover was created by Leonardo in early 16th-century Florence not long after he started the Mona Lisa. Surviving drawings and copies suggest it was outrageous and titillating: one, in Chatsworth House, Derbyshire, portrays the swan putting a wing around the voluptuous Leda as it whispers into, or stimulates, her ear.If Leonardo was creating such sublime eroticism as he worked on the Mona Lisa around 1504, it’s no great leap to believe he created a nude version as well. In his notebooks, he boasts that while a poet can only describe a patron’s lover, the painter can bring her to life – and “the lovestruck judge” will prefer the picture every time. He even relates gleefully how a man once returned a painting he did of the Virgin Mary because it filled him with the wrong thoughts.The Mona Lisa was 'iconic' the moment it was first seen – artists saw it as unequalledGiuliano de’ Medici, Leonardo’s patron, got married in early 1515. My hypothesis is that, as a memento, Leonardo portrayed naked a mistress whom Giuliano would be forced to give up, sitting her in the exact pose of the Mona Lisa. For the painter, as Leonardo insisted, “can place before the lover a true likeness of the beloved, often making him kiss and speak to it”.If Leonardo actually created a nude Mona Lisa, that tells us something extraordinary about the world’s most famous painting and its creator. The artist, it seems, was able to joke about what we now call the “iconic” nature of his work. It is sometimes assumed the fame of the Mona Lisa is a modern cultural phenomenon, sparked by an early 20th-century heist, Duchamp and Warhol’s versions and mass reproduction. That’s not true. It was iconic the moment it was first seen: artists saw it as unequalled.Leonardo was so confident of that uniqueness he felt able to travesty it with a naked version. He was cleverer than us. While he can’t have know that, in the 21st century, people would queue in the rain to see his masterpiece, he did know it was the ultimate painting. Leonardo’s Mona Lisa is a vision of artistic perfection, clothed or naked.Explore more on these topicsMona LisaLeonardo da VinciArtPaintingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It should galvanise all those who oppose himFri 9 Jan 2026 12.24 ESTLast modified on Fri 9 Jan 2026 15.10 ESTShareFor a serial liar, Donald Trump can be bracingly honest. We’ve known about the mendacity for years – consider the30,573 documented falsehoodsfrom the president’s first term, culminating in the big lie, his claim to have won the 2020 election – but the examples of bracing candour are fresher. This week both began and ended with the US president speaking the shocking truth.At a press conference to celebrate his capture of the Venezuelan dictator Nicolás Maduro, Trumpannounced thatfrom now on the US would “run” that country, before moving in the very next breath to Venezuela’s oil. There was no pious talk of democracy, scant mention even of the drug trafficking that earlier served as a pretext for military action. Instead, Trump said out loud what had once been a slogan on leftist placards in protest at past US interventions, admitting that it really was all about the oil. It was as transparent a revelation of Trump’s true motive as you could have asked for.As the week closed, there was another disarmingly frank disclosure from the president, a confession that makes sense of both the crazy start to 2026 – and the man who is increasingly shaping our world.Before we get to that statement, it’s worth registering how hard it can be to square these flashes of Trumpian honesty with the stream of untruths and, more subtly, contradictions and hypocrisies that emanate from him the rest of the time. Note, for example, Trump’s response when asked for his new year resolution: “Peace. Peace on Earth,” he said. Two days later, he wasraining lethal fireon Caracas – and a few days after that, he was defending a US federal agent who hadshot dead a mother of threein Minneapolis, a woman who posed no conceivable threat to anyone. The self-styled President of Peace is the bringer of war at home and abroad.These two fronts are more alike than they might seem. The common thread is rule by fear. Trump’s aim in Venezuela has been to remove Maduro and hope that fear will do the rest. No need for a boots-on-the-ground occupation or “second wave” military assault; no need even for regime change. Removal of the man at the top should be enough to intimidate Maduro’s erstwhile henchmen, and especiallyhis chief henchwoman, into doing the US’s bidding, starting with the handover of its oil industry.What’s more, fear is contagious. Cuba has most reason to be anxious, but Trump alsowarned Colombia’s leaderto “watch his ass”, while signalling that he isconsidering airstrikes on Mexico, aimed at drug cartels he says are now running that country. The mere threat of a repeat of last weekend’s action on Venezuela may well be enough to bring the rest of the Americas to heel.That fear reaches across the Atlantic. Trump’s desire for Greenland was once dismissed as a punchline, but after Venezuela no one is laughing. Now we know that Trump’s words are the best guide to his future actions: if he says he wants something, he may well take it. In truth, the US’s European allies have been governed by fear since the day 11 months ago when Trumphumiliated Volodymr Zelenskyyin the Oval Office: they worry that if they stand up to the bully in the White House, the bully will turn on them. Specifically, they fear that if they complain about Trump’s designs on Greenland, he will pull the plug on US support for Ukraine.But, to Trump, fear is not only a commodity for export. It is how he rules at home too. Much has been made of his campaign of intimidation of US institutions, from the media to the universities to the courts. Rather less attention has been paid to his efforts to intimidate the American public, to make ordinary US citizens frightened of their own government.But that is where we are now. For many months, masked agents of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, have been snatching people off the streets and meting out brutal punishment to those who get in their way. Witnesses in Minneapolisdescribed an“insane” scene on Thursday, 24 hours after the killing of 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good: “Large convoys of heavily armed masked men, blocking off streets at random, grabbing people nearly at random.” It’s always illuminating to report this as we would if it were happening somewhere far away: “Heavily armed government militias are roaming unchecked through US cities and shooting human rights observers dead in the streets,” to quotethe New Republic’s Greg Sargent. On Thursday border patrol agents in Portland, Oregonshot two peopleoutside a hospital.Fuelling the fear are the lies. Trump pretended his beef with Maduro was the supply of narcotics into the US, even though it is hardly Venezuelan drugs that arekilling Americans– and even as he, Trump, had just pardoned and released the ex-president of Honduras, who had beenconvicted and jailedfor flooding the US with 400 tonnes of cocaine.The lies at home are even more egregious. On the killing of Good, Trump and his officials have urged Americans to disbelieve their own eyes, insisting that Good was a “domestic terrorist” bent on using her car as a weapon whenvideo footage of the incidentleaves no doubt that she was not trying to kill ICE agents, but to get away from them. The lying never stops, even when that means defaming the dead. JD Vancecalled the slain womana “deranged leftist”.Of course, what these assaults, domestic and foreign, have in common is the drive for power, free of challenge or restraint. South American countries are to submit, as are Democrat-run cities and states. Whether it’s sending special forces to Caracas or ordering the National Guard into Los Angeles and Washington DC, the goal is control.Which brings us to that second eruption of honesty. At the end of the week,Trump told the New York Timesthat he recognises only one constraint on his ability to act: “My own morality. My own mind. It’s the only thing that can stop me.” All the other official checks or balances are as nothing. His disregard for international law is total, but he sees domestic law much the same way: judges only have the power to restrain him “under certain circumstances”, he told the NYT.That is an honest account by Trump of how he sees himself: not so much a national president as a global emperor. Now those who oppose him have to be just as honest. Trump may be right that the US arsenal is such that no country can stand up to him, and certainly not alone. But the major European powers, and others, do have leverage, especially if they act in concert. More directly, the US public has a formidable weapon in its hands: it can vote to wrest the House of Representatives, at least, from the Republicans in November, which will act as an instant curb on Trump’s power. At home and abroad, it means overcoming fear, combining together and admitting the menace we now confront – and doing so honestly.Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnistGuardian newsroom: Year One of Trumpism: Is Britain Emulating the US?On Wednesday 21 January 2026, join Jonathan Freedland, Tania Branigan and Nick Lowles as they reflect on the first year of Donald Trump’s second presidency.

But without clear rules, it can lead to power imbalances, feuds and even unfair evictions …Elle HuntFri 9 Jan 2026 10.00 ESTShareWhen Rachel needed a place to live, Maya was only too happy to offer her spare room. What are friends for?Rachel had recently returned to her home town to start afresh, having been made redundant. Maya, a childhood friend, owned her three-bedroom home, having been helped to buy it by her parents.When Rachel offered to pay rent, Maya suggested a figure – the market rate. Rachel agreed, recognising that she was in a bind and that Maya was helping her.Over time, however, she found herself increasingly at Maya’s beck and call, and doing more than her share of the housework. If Maya left dirty dishes in the sink, or didn’t clean the stovetop after cooking, Rachel did it for her.She even obliged with Maya’s more idiosyncratic house rules, such as no laundry in the common areas, and no strong kitchen smells. Rachel hung her laundry in her room and refrained from cooking fish or curry. “That was my way of saying, ‘Thank you for sharing your house with me,’” she says, even though she was also paying rent.But Maya’s demands escalated. She started questioning how often Rachel worked from home and did her laundry. But the breaking point came when the front door lock broke. The locksmith who fixed it said it was a building fault; Maya blamed Rachel and charged her for the repair.“I realised what had been obvious the whole time,” Rachel says. Maya treated her like a friend only when it suited her. Otherwise, Rachel was her tenant. Rachel moved out not long afterwards. “I don’t think I want a friend who would do that to me – or anyone else.”Friendship should be cherished as a relationship between equals, but worsening inequality is testing that, forcing friends into the uneven dynamic of landlord and lodger.According to flatsharing websiteSpareRoom, there was an 89% increase in homeowners taking in lodgers over the three years to January 2024, driven by rising living costs. Renters face the same pressures, especially in London, where rooms now cost an average of £1,000 a month.With homeowners seeking a side income, and renters scrambling for affordable accommodation, friends on either side of the divide are meeting each other halfway.No friend should know how much toilet paper the other uses in a day. She sometimes uses a whole roll – it drives me crazyIntroducing the “friendlord”: you need a room, they have one to spare, and you know you get on – they might even cut you a deal on the rent. It can seem like the best possible compromise in such an unequal society.It’s also a risk, creating a power imbalance in a personal relationship. Not all friendships are built to withstand discussions of money, requests for repairs or cohabitation. And should the situation break down, you stand to lose not just a roof over your head, but a relationship, too.Emily moved in with her friendlord three years ago. They’ve known each other since childhood, and Emily was looking for a room just as her friend was buying a flat – it seemed win-win.The squabbling, the vomiting, the freeloading and the noisy sex: my 10 worst house-share momentsRead moreBut she’s struggled to feel it’s truly her home. “I’m always very aware of myself, and don’t feel at ease in shared spaces like I did when I lived in a flat we were all renting,” Emily says. She keeps her photos off the fridge and, if any of her food goes missing, she keeps quiet, not wanting to confront a friend. The implicit hierarchy even extends to the bathroom towel rail: her friend’s towel goes on the top rung, and Emily’s below. The close quarters have also brought an uneasy intimacy to their relationship. “No friend should know how much toilet paper the other uses,” Emily says. “She sometimes uses a whole roll in a day – it drives me crazy.”Her friend is at least not precious or controlling as a landlord, and charges her mates’ rates in rent: “It’s an absolute bargain.”Emily admits her frustration mostly stems from having to live in her friend’s pocket, at a time in life when she wants independence. “I feel like the loser friend,” she says. “Buying a house is a big goal of mine and I wish it was possible right now.”For others, however, the risks of renting from a friend are still less of a worry than taking their chances on the market. “When it’s a friend, you know – or you hope – that you’re not going to be totally screwed over,” says Helen.View image in fullscreenComposite: Getty/AlamyShe rents a room from a friend who lives with her partner. Rather than rely on goodwill, Helen’s friend was “very by the book”, drawing up an agreement and inventory, registering a deposit and even consulting the Landlord Advice helpline.That brings Helen peace of mind, and not just as a tenant. “Because it’s done in a formal, official way, it helps me to separate her as a friend and as a landlord. I’ve had people go, ‘You’re just paying off your friend’s mortgage’, but we’re in totally different circumstances,” she says. “She was in a position to buy, and I wasn’t.”For the friendlord, who is in the more powerful position, the shift can be tricky to manage. When Tim offered his flat to his friend, after moving in with his girlfriend, he was keenly aware of the responsibility involved.“I’ve had plenty of shit landlords over the course of my life – the absolute last thing I would want is to end up being one myself,” he says. “In an ideal world, we wouldn’t have landlords at all.”Tim’s response has been to try to be as transparent and fair as possible: he charges his friend 25-50% less than market rates in rent, with reductions when cash is tight, and didn’t ask for a deposit. “As friends, those are things we should be able to work out, and I trust him to treat the flat with care,” he says.Tim is proactive with repairs and maintenance, even paying for materials to paint the walls. “I mean, these are really basic things you’d hope any landlord would do – but when your tenants are your friends, it’s even more important.”More broadly, Tim strives to be mindful of the essential imbalance between him and his friend. “While the bricks and mortar are my asset, it is his home,” he says.When they meet up socially, it’s usually at the pub. “I am probably less likely to go round to his flat – my flat – than I am another friend’s, simply because I don’t want to impinge,” he says. “I think it would be a bit weird if I was hanging out there every Friday night.”Without mutual understanding, the fact that one friend is now the “landlord” can become harder to overlook, says journalist Alice Wilkinson, author ofHow to Stay Sane in a House Share.She once rented from an old friend after reaching breaking point in a houseshare, but found their shared history helped them to navigate any awkwardness.Their six months cohabiting even deepened their friendship, allowing her to get to know her friend’s husband. “I’d never have come to know him that well if we hadn’t lived together, so that was a wonderful thing,” she says.I had renters’ rights, but didn’t feel I could exercise them because we were ‘friends’ … She evicted me on New Year’s EveOthers aren’t so lucky. A woman Wilkinson spoke to for her book wound up becoming her live-in landlady’s personal chef, cooking meals to order. She’d signed up to a meal kit, and her landlord would express preferences from the available recipes. “She’d just make her dinners all the time … She didn’t want to live like that, but because her flatmate owned the house, she kind of had to comply.”Sometimes the divide between the friendlord and the lodger’s statuses is made as plain as day. Melissa lived with a home-owning couple in a flat on a brightly lit street. “One day they came home all excited to tell me about their new blackout curtains,” she remembers. “I was also excited, until I realised they hadn’t bought any for my room.” It highlighted the “weird dynamic”, she says. “I moved out not long after.”At worst, friendlords can be actively exploitative. After moving in with a friend of a friend who owned a three-bedroom flat, Eimear found herself being treated as a “revenue stream”.“At the start it was fine,” she says. The friendlord had explicit house rules, but Eimear was happy to comply, given the relatively cheap rent.But not long after Eimear moved in, the friendlord decided to go travelling. While overseas, she listed her room and the spare on Airbnb – leaving Eimear living alongside a constant stream of strangers.“At one point I was living with two men who I hadn’t met,” she says. “ I would literally lie in bed thinking: ‘Who is next door to me?’”The “strange, hierarchical setup” with her friendlord made Eimear feel as though she couldn’t push back. “I had renters’ rights, but I didn’t feel I could exercise them because we were ‘friends’. And she played on that, too,” she adds.After a few months, she told her friendlord the situation wasn’t working and she was thinking of moving out. “She evicted me on New Year’s Eve.”The rapid rise of renters in their 60s: ‘I hate the idea of house-sharing – but I have no choice’Read moreA friendlord may even provide less security than taking your chances on the market. Lodgers (sharing their landlords’ primary residence) actually have fewer rights than renters, being more vulnerable to rent increases and not being covered by thedeposit protectionsystem. The property owner also has to provide only basic notice of eviction.“Even if you trust your friend, it is possible that in a week or less you could be kicked out,” says Nye Jones, head of campaigns atGeneration Rent.Jones suggests renting from a friend might be best approached as a temporary solution, and advises caution even between good friends. As a lodger, he says, “you are living with much less security … The landlord can even just change the locks.”That would probably spell the end of the friendship, too, he agrees. “It’s difficult to come back from a lock change.”Explore more on these topicsLife and styleHousingHomesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Now the director of Oldboy is back with a blistering satire about a man driven to murder after redundancyFri 9 Jan 2026 03.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 9 Jan 2026 05.14 ESTShareThe Korean wave is being feted around the world right now but Park Chan-wook is not feeling too celebratory. From the outside, South Korea seems to be a well-oiled machine pumping out a stream of world-conquering pop music, cuisine, cars, cinema (especially the Oscar-winningParasite) and TV shows, as well as the Samsung flat-screens to watch them on. But Park’s latest film,No Other Choice, bursts the balloon somewhat. It paints modern-day Korea as an unstable landscape of industrial decline, downsizing, unemployment and male fragility – with no KPop Demon Hunters coming to save the day.“I did not mean it for it to be a realistic portrayal of Korea in 2025,” says Park, a serene, almost professorial 62-year-old. “I think it’s more accurate to view it as a satire on capitalism.”AI is so powerful that you can’t even compete with it any moreNo Other Choice’s setting is the comically mundane but almost literally cut-throat world of paper manufacturing, where a freshly fired executive hatches a deranged scheme to get ahead by murdering his rivals for a new position, of which he does a pretty bad job. But it could just as well be about the entertainment industry, which is also more precarious than it looks, Park suggests: “Even though Korean films and shows are so globally trendy, Korean audiences have not been returning to the theatre after the pandemic, and there’s also talk around how the TV industry is being threatened. And this decline happened immediately after the success of Squid Game and Parasite. I think that gap in itself is very ironic.”Irony is very much the mode with Park’s cinema. No Other Choice begins with salaryman Man-su (played by Lee Byung-hun) congratulating himself for having it all: a good job, beautiful house, loving wife, two children and two dogs. He welcomes the onset of fall, not realising it augurs his own fall: within days he is on his knees begging for work, having been made redundant by his new American bosses, which leads him to his deranged murder plan. It sounds bleak but it’s leavened by heavy doses of black comedy, mordant slapstick and clumsy violence, including a hare-brained plot to eliminate one of his competitors by getting obliteratingly drunk with him – via the very Korean technique ofpoktanju: a shot glass of whisky sunk into a pint of beer. Park was no stranger to this cocktail in the past, he admits, “but I don’t drink it any more. I realised that I shouldn’t be doing that to myself.”View image in fullscreenNo Other Choice.Photograph: Everett/ShutterstockEven No Other Choice’s title is ironic: Man-su clearlydoeshave other choices. He could go after his employers rather than his peers. Or he could simply put up with being poorer – but he’ll do anything to avoid losing his house and his status, especially within the family. “The audience desperately wants to cheer him on and for him to find a job, but at other times, they realise that his choices are wrong,” says Park. “Those two feelings coexist, and the audience switches between them. That was the goal behind the making of this film.”The greater irony here is that Park is practically the poster boy for Korean cultural clout. He has been on the crest of the Korean wave for the past 20 years, and alongside his compatriot, Parasite director Bong Joon-ho, he has broken down barriers for the country’s cinema. As with Bong, Park’s movies have combined festival acclaim with commercial appeal, not least hisbreakthrough Oldboy, which won the Grand Prix at Cannes in 2004 and introduced the world to a new brand of vivid, gruesome, twisted but technically accomplished cinema – epitomised by the scenes where Oldboy’s protagonist dispatches multiple assailants in a one-take corridor battle, armed only with a hammer, and another where he eats a live octopus. In the UK, Park’s films were marketed under a DVD label called “Asia Extreme”, alongside works by compatriots such as Kim Jee-woon and Kim Ki-duk and certain Japanese directors.Looking back, Park is uneasy: “I felt like I was getting boxed in because of that brand. It created an unnecessary form of prejudice.” He’s relieved that the label no longer applies, partly because his “extreme” aesthetic has infused mainstream cinema, but also because Park moved on with apparent ease to Hollywood and slightly less violent English-language projects. These included his 2018 John le Carré miniseriesThe Little Drummer Girl, starring Florence Pugh and Alexander Skarsgård, and 2024’s underratedThe Sympathizer, about Viet-Cong spies in 70s America, featuring Robert Downey Jr in multiple roles.“It’s not like I’m making intentional choices to mellow down my violence to avoid that sort of a reputation,” he says. “I don’t know what kind of films I’ll be making in the future, but they could be equally as graphic as my previous ones.”View image in fullscreenPark Chan-wook and Nicole Kidman on the set of Stoker.Photograph: PictureLux/The Hollywood Archive/AlamyDirecting in English wasn’t as easy as it looked, he adds, especially on his first Hollywood feature, 2013’s Stoker, a Hitchcockian thriller starring Nicole Kidman and Matthew Goode. “I was scared at first, especially in regards to having conversations through an interpreter,” he says. He was helped by his actors. “It actually wasn’t that different, maybe because Nicole tried her best to adjust to me.” Kidman prefers to do her own preparation, he explains, whereas he prefers to sit down with the whole cast and work through the script line by line. “I suggested to her: why don’t we just try it out? And ultimately, she said it was very helpful.”He is not fluent in English and is speaking through an interpreter today, but “my English is good enough where if I sense that something is not being translated correctly, I can point that out,” he says. “Another issue that could arise is misunderstanding from linguistic or cultural differences, but I’ve actually tried to use that to my advantage, because I could offer a perspective on British or American societies that people within the society might fail to see.”Now, like Bong, he mixes it up: some projects in English, some in Korean, others a hybrid of the two. His sumptuous lesbian thrillerThe Handmaidentransposed Sarah Waters’ novel Fingersmith from Victorian England to early 20th-century Korea. Similarly, No Other Choice is adapted from The Ax, a novel by American crime writer Donald Westlake, but set in Ulsan, a coastal city in south-east Korea. Park has been trying to adapt the story since he first read it in about 2005, he explains – around the same time as a French-language adaptation of the same story was released. “Initially, this was intended as an American film in English, but lots of fruitless years have passed, and it eventually changed into a Korean film.”View image in fullscreenKim Min-hee and Kim Tae-ri in The Handmaiden.Photograph: Amazon Studios/AllstarThe delay at least gave him the chance to cast Lee, who first worked with Park on his 2001 hit Joint Security Area, and more recently starred in Squid Game and voiced the chief demon in KPop Demon Hunters. Park describes him as “the Jack Lemmon of Korea” – handsome but expressive and versatile, a relatable everyman. “Before, he would have been too young for the role, but because a lot of time has passed, he had reached just the right age.”Despite the story’s age, the themes of economic and masculine insecurity – and the victims of neoliberal capitalism turning on each other rather than the real villains – still resonate, especially in Korea. But Park has given it a very 21st-century update: the spectre of artificial intelligence looms large in this new industrial landscape, adding another level of irony to the tale. “While the original novel portrayed competition between humans, I added AI, which is so powerful that you can’t even compete with it any more,” he says.Again, these anxieties are not limited to paper manufacturing – even if it can be seen as a metaphor for the dying age of analogue. Park is well aware that AI is coming for his own profession, too. “It doesn’t look as threatening right now, but considering the speed of its development in the past year, I’m very concerned for how many people in our film industry will have their jobs replaced by AI.” He’s worried for colleagues, he says, “but I’m also worried for a situation in which I have no choice but to embrace AI – for instance, if studios decide to cut budgets with AI.”No Other Choice review – sensational state-of-the-nation satire from Park Chan-wookRead moreEither way, he’s unlikely to be bumping off his rivals, No Other Choice-style. Especially not Bong Joon-ho: the two of them are old friends. Park gave Bong his first job, in fact. “I asked him to work on a script for me, and we had discussions, but it never ended up happening.” The two have used the same actors, including Parasite star Song Kang-ho, and Park co-produced Bong’s 2013sci-fi movie Snowpiercer. “Our wives are very close as well, so we meet up very often. AndSong Kang-ho– his family is also very close with our families. So we often hang out together,” he says. “When I wrote the first draft for No Other Choice, I shared the script with [Bong] and asked for his feedback.”Perhaps that’s part of the reason Korea’s screen culture has been so successful recently. Not only are they not at each other’s throats, their work often views economic success and the capitalist model with scepticism, if not downright pessimism. There’s no Korean equivalent of the American Dream, it seems. You could say No Other Choice tackles head-on the same ironies and inequalities as Bong’s Parasite, or his recent sci-fi comedyMickey 17– where a cloned Robert Pattinson plays the ultimate expendable worker. Or even Hwang Dong-hyuk’s Squid Game, with its life-or-death, winner-takes-all gameshow setup, which wasinspired by Hwang’s own experiencesof economic hardship after the 2008 financial crash. Perhaps Korean cinema is offering perspectives that we westerners are failing to see.Not that Park has any stated agenda, philosophically, thematically or even geographically. As if to prove the point, he says his next two projects are both US-backed, but one is a sci-fi (adapted from the Japanese manga Genocidal Organ), the other a western (Brigands of Rattlecreek – it sounds very violent).“If I got a proposal for a good story that takes place in France or in a country in Africa, I would go there,” he says. “I just follow good stories.”No Other Choice will be in UK cinemas on 23 January.Explore more on these topicsFilmSouth KoreafeaturesShareReuse this content"

It was briefly – Starman reached No 18, and Space Oddity No 24 – but then it wasn’t.Each year, Forbes compiles a posthumous celebrity rich list. Bowie appeared in 2016, ranked atNo 11 with estimated earnings of $10.5m(£7.8m), and again in 2017, in the same position but withearnings of $9.5m(£7m). This was unsurprising given the enormous spike in interest there is in the immediate aftermath of a superstar’s death. Yet he didn’t appear in the Forbes list again until 2022, when he was at No 3 withearnings of $250m(£195m) – the highest-ranked musician that year – but that was almost all attributable tothe sale of his music publishing rightsto Warner Chappell.Unlike Prince, John Lennon, Elvis Presley, Bob Marley or Michael Jackson, Bowie has not become a Forbes fixture. And with publishing now removed from his earnings tally, he is unlikely to reappear in that list unless the estate sells the master recordings from 1968 onwards that it owns and currentlylicenses to Warner Music Group.Financial success is one measurement of posthumous success and importance. Streaming is another, where Bowie also underperforms for an artist of his stature. He currently has 22 million monthly listeners on Spotify compared with Bob Marley’s 26m, Whitney Houston’s 34m, Elvis Presley’s 45m and John Lennon’s 43m. Only one Bowie track makes it into Spotify’s “Billions Club”: Under Pressure, with more than 2bn plays. But that is presumably driven by Queen’s involvement, especially given they have a further seven tracks with more than a billion streams each.One explanation for this may be the Bowie estate’s difficulties in courting a new, young audience. While Bowie has an official profile on Instagram with three million followers, and TikTok with 656k, with the latter especially being home to younger fans, the estate’s focus has leaned heavily towards expensive box sets such asWho Can I Be Now? (1974–1976)and I Can’t Give Everything Away (2002–2016), as well as a plethora of live albums (13 in total since his death). This approach serves affluent middle-aged fans – but the releases are out of the price range and field of interest for teenagers who might become the Bowie obsessives of tomorrow. There has only been one greatest hits album released since his death, Legacy (The Very Best of David Bowie) in November 2016. It is arguable in the streaming age that playlists such as This Is David Bowie on Spotify and David Bowie Essentials on Apple Music do a better job.Bowie has also become the unofficial patron saint of BBC 6 Music – a positive in some senses, albeit one that only goes so far given that just2% of 6 Music’s audience are 24 or younger. Unlike in the 1980s, when he starred in Labyrinth (back in cinemas this weekfor its 40th anniversary) and The Snowman, there are few enticing entry points for the younger listeners who are essential to keep his legacy alive.View image in fullscreen‘A sourcebook for the Bowies of tomorrow’ … a  fraction of the items from the musician’s archive that are available to view at V&A East Storehouse’s David Bowie Centre in London.Photograph: David Parry/PAIt could be argued that Bowie’s estate is prizing quality over quantity, by saying no to more things than it green-lights. Itrefused to license musicto the Stardust biopic in 2021, endorsing instead Brett Morgen’sMoonage Daydreamdocumentary in 2022. The documentary Bowie: The Final Act waswell receivedwhen it was released last month, and shifts focus away from his imperial period in the 1970s to his commercial apex in the 1980s and his career beyond. There were also year-long Bowie 75 celebrations in 2021, to mark what would have been his 75th birthday, although that mostly seemed to mean arash of pop-up shopsin London and New York.Unquestionably the most interesting estate project was the opening last year of the David Bowie Centre at the V&A East Storehouse in London, where80,000 items from across his entire career– including handwritten lyrics, costumes and instruments – are stored. Tristram Hunt, the V&A’s director, called it a “new sourcebook for the Bowies of tomorrow” and it may prove to be the most enduring project.This could be read as the estate focusing on his long-term legacy rather than a short-term “algorithmic legacy” of chasing viral hits on TikTok and Spotify, which would risk reducing his ever-changing art to one song. The use of “Heroes” in the finale of Netflix’s Stranger Things last week was clearly hoped to vivify the track. It charted at No 34; by comparison, Kate Bush’s Running Up That Hillimmediately went Top 10after being used in the series in 2022. It also has only had 38k uses in TikTok videos to date – not exactly viral numbers.This quality-over-quantity thesis only holds up to a point. In 2022, the estate, albeitfor charitable reasons, embraced the short-lived digital gimmickry of NFTs,doing so again in 2023with an unheard version of Let’s Dance. And then there is the official Bowie store where, alongside the usual T-shirts and posters, you can buy a vast array of socks, a bar stool, a walnut cutting board or a baby’s bib. The site is choked with tchotchkes featuring the Aladdin Sane flash that has become synonymous with Bowie, reducing his many visual incarnations to a brief moment in 1973 – not unlike how US rockers Kiss became a visual brand more than a band. For such a future-facing artist, the future of Bowie’s legacy doesn’t seem so innovative, or assured.This article was updated on 9 January to reflect the chart position of “Heroes” the week after the Stranger Things finaleExplore more on these topicsDavid BowieMusic industryPop and rockV&AMuseumsMusic documentaryanalysisShareReuse this content"

An absurdist Tina Fey-produced cable news sitcom, it contains at least two of the finest comedy performances you will ever see. Andrea Martin is breathlessly full-tilt as a retirement-age intern, while John Michael Higgins’s anchor Chuck Pierce is a blowhard for the ages. It should be too broad to work, but every episode is so packed with every imaginable style of joke that it flies. Every time I watch Great News, Iget angrythat there were only ever 23 episodes made.

From Frasier’s great injustices and ego trips (who can forget the symphony he wrote for his radio show jingle?) to Niles’s descriptions of absent wife Maris (“I tried to follow her tracks in the snow but, alas, she made none”) and endless misunderstandings that land them in trouble (the Halloween episodewhere Niles thinks Daphne is pregnant is a hoot), it cracks me up every single time. More tender moments between the brothers and their ex-cop father Marty – who has no time for their snobby ways – give the show a big heart, too. Just look at the pause-for-thought scene were Frasier tries to get rid of Marty’s chair. The jazzy theme tune that Imustsing loudly to. The log fire in that dreamy Seattle penthouse. The coffee shop.

Seeing this middle-aged, mega-rich white man tug aubergines from the aspirational gardens of his rural Essex mansion, carry them to his rustic-chic barn conversion, then “hero” them in a dukkah roast chicken is the equivalent for me of a guided meditation.

The repetition – mini-challenge, maxi-challenge, runway, lip sync “for your life!” – feels reassuring; the baffling catchphrases (“She done already done had herses!”) oddly soothing.

But the main draw of this incomprehensibly paced soap opera is Charmaine, a woman whose pregnancy makes the gestation period of an elephant look speedy. In the five series it takes for her to reach full term, we see a fire almost tear downVirgin River, the local doctor go blind then regain his sight, the town mayor be overthrown, replaced, then reappointed and the local weed farm turn into a fentanyl pipeline – and get busted by the FBI.

Cue hilariously awkward encounters, endless shenanigans with his friends (Daniel Ings as Luke, his best mate, is a comedy tour de force) and a will-they-won’t-they romance that out-smoulders Ross and Rachel’s between Dylan and Evie (Antonia Thomas). It’s a beautifully written show that digs into the messiness of love and the power of friendship, and a regular in my rewatch rotation. It’s perfect comfort TV – heartwarming and moving with the actors providing a cosy blanket of non-stop laughs to wrap around you as the chill of winter descends.Ann LeeSex and the CityView image in fullscreenStill feels thrillingly alive … Cynthia Nixon as Miranda Hobbes, Kim Cattrall as Samantha Jones, Kristin Davis as Charlotte York and Sarah Jessica Parker and Carrie Bradshaw in Sex and the City.Photograph: HBOWhen I was an unkissed teenager,Sex and the Cityprovided the giddy promise of dates and sex to come. When I lived in New York after the show had just ended, it offered the only relatable reflection of the city as it was then (on-location Manhattan shooting, how I miss you). When I lived in London in the years after, it felt like an old friend, a bittersweet reminder of a place and life I missed. Now, living in New York again, it’s closer to a historical document, both of the city and of my youth. It ended long ago but life always finds new reasons for me to rewatch a show of such electric energy that even years after it died, it still feels thrillingly alive.Benjamin LeePinguView image in fullscreenChilly escapades … Pingu.Photograph: Hit EntertainmentYou can’t beat a burst ofPinguon hisYouTube channel.

Authorities look more vulnerable this time around because of the dire economic situation and the aftermath of last year’s conflict with Israel and the US.Trump, in an interview with Fox News on Thursday, suggested the supreme leader was preparing to flee Iran. “He’s looking to go somewhere. It’s getting very bad,” he said.On Friday night he warned Iran’s leaders that they “better not start shooting because we’ll start shooting too”.Graph showing Iran’s annual consumer price inflation rateThe head of Iran’s judiciary, Gholamhossein Mohseni Ejei, said consequences for demonstrators would be “decisive, maximum and without any legal leniency”.The leaders of France, Germany and the UK released a joint statement on Friday night urging Iran to exercise restraint.“We are deeply concerned about reports of violence by Iranian security forces and strongly condemn the killing of protesters,” they said. “The Iranian authorities have the responsibility to protect their own population and must allow for the freedom of expression and peaceful assembly without fear of reprisal. We urge the Iranian authorities to exercise restraint, to refrain from violence and to uphold the fundamental rights of Iran’s citizens.”An internet blackout introduced on Thursday has sharply reduced the amount of information flowing out of the country. The Iranian rights group Hengaw reported that a protest march after Friday prayers in Zahedan, where the Baloch minority predominates, was met with gunfire that wounded several people.Amnesty International said the “blanket internet shutdown” aims to “hide the true extent of the grave human rights violations and crimes under international law they are carrying out to crush” the protests.Norway-based NGO Iran Human Rights, raising a previous toll of 45 issued the day earlier, said at least 51 protesters, including nine children, have been killed by security forces and hundreds more injured.The US-based Human Rights Activists news agency said that at least 50 people have been killed in the violence surrounding protests, while more than 2,270 others have been detained.Videos from the protests on Thursday showed crowds of thousands of people marching through the streets of Tehran, setting fire to a building belonging to the Iranian state broadcasters and hoisting a flag bearing the lion and sun emblem – the flag of Iran before the 1979 revolution that brought the current regime to power.View image in fullscreenAli Khamenei speaking in Qom yesterday.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesReza Pahlavi, the exiled son of the late shah, who had called for the protests on Thursday night, made another call for demonstrations to take place at 8pm (1630 GMT) on Friday. He also called on Trump to help the protesters, saying Khamenei “wants to use this blackout to murder these young heroes”.Footage from Thursday showed protesters chanting in support of Pahlavi, including in Mashhad, Khamenei’s home town. Protesters who went out on Thursday night said they were met with violence – part of what rights groups are calling an already brutal crackdown.“They’re aiming for the eyes,” Maryam, a 25-year-old artist who was at protests in Tehran in the early hours of Friday, told the Guardian via text message. “The Faraja [uniformed police], the Basij [paramilitary militia] and even plainclothes kill squads are driving into the crowds with motorbikes. I don’t know how long the internet will be working but we are thousands on the streets and I fear I will wake up to hundreds of casualties.”Map of protests in TehranIranian state media acknowledged the protests for the first time on Friday, casting the unrest as violent riots instigated by “terrorist agents” of the US and Israel. State TV channels projected an air of normality, airing footage of pro-government demonstrations and saying life went on as usual for most Iranians.State media claimed Iran had caught agents from the Mossad, Israel’s intelligence agency, who had infiltrated protest movements. The Iranian-owned Press TV reported that an Israeli spy cell was planning a “false-flag killing operation aimed at blaming the state for civilian deaths”.Speaking in Beirut on Friday, the Iranian foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, echoed claims of overseas interference. “The protests that are happening in Iran of course are different from protests in other countries because of US and Israeli interventions in the protests,” he said. “You need to look at all the statements from the US and Israel to see how they are interfering.”Authorities cut off internet access in Iran at about 8pm local time on Thursday, about the same time as Pahlavi’s call for protests. Understanding exactly what was happening in Iran and the true size of protests was difficult, with data and phone lines down. Human rights groups said documenting human rights violations was also hampered by the shutdown.View image in fullscreenPeople gather on the streets during a protest in Mashhad, in a screen grab obtained from a social media video on Thursday.Photograph: Social media/ReutersStudents at a university in Tehran said they were trying to find a way to avoid the internet shutdown, relying on methods they developed during the war with Israel in the summer when authorities also shut down access.Hossein, a 22-year-old university student, said: “Since June we have been trying several ways to find these ‘secret tunnels’ that can route our messages outside the country. A group of us are able to still chat but I can see mobile lines are also getting disrupted.”Demonstrators appeared to respond to Pahlavi’s call on Thursday, with anti-government chants ringing out at 8pm, as well as calls for the exiled crown prince to return.One protester, Mehnaz, said she believed Pahlavi could assist with a transition to democracy. “We failed to unify under a strong opposition last time [2022] but we have learned our lessons,” said the 46-year-old. “We have to rally for him because we are desperate to survive.”Elements of the protest movement, largely leaderless until now, have rallied around the figure, though it was unclear if chants were mainly in support of the crown prince or of pre-1979 rule.“I am proud of each and every one of you who conquered the streets across Iran on Thursday night,” Pahlavi said in a post on X. “I know that despite the internet shutdown and communication, you won’t leave the streets. Make sure that victory is yours!”Graph showing Iran’s GDP growthPahlavi’s call for more demonstrations on Friday would be a further test of the exiled figure’s popularity and the staying power of protests in the face of the authorities’ crackdown.His organisation alleged that tens of thousands of security officers had signalled their intention to defect via a platform it had set up, and that the organisation had been inundated by requests from officers.‘In isolation, we’ll never flourish’: What Iranians think about the protests and an end to the Islamic RepublicRead moreHuman Rights Watch (HRW) and Amnesty International condemned what they said was authorities’ use of force and mass arbitrary arrests. HRW has documented the deaths of 28 protesters who were shot by security forces between 31 December and 3 January, with instances of authorities using rifles and shotguns loaded with metal pellets.“We have so far documented many of the harrowing patterns of human rights violations that authorities have repeatedly committed during the previous rounds of protest crackdowns, including in November 2019, and the Woman, Life, Freedom protests of 2022,” said Bahar Saba, a senior HRW researcher on Iran and Kuwait.The crackdown seemed only to harden the resolve of protesters, many of whom described scenes of defiance including rocks thrown at officers, forcing them to retreat.Ali, a 21-year-old student in Tehran, said via text message: “Fuck them! The cowards abandoned their vehicles and fled! We took over the streets tonight. We will burn their vans, the same that they use to drag our compatriots and kidnap our sisters from the streets. The country belongs to us!”Anger at the theocratic regime and its clerics seemed to boil over throughout the week. On Wednesday, crowds of men streamed into a Shia seminary in the city of Gonabad, beating staff with sticks and damaging the facility, according to the director of the seminary, Ismail Tavakoli.Another person said unarmed protesters were confronting riot police and throwing rocks in response to bullets fired by officers. “They are vulgar and are saying we are in bed with the Israelis and Americans,” said Farzad, a 37-year-old mobile shop owner in the city of Rasht in northern Iran. “They call us traitors. It’s them that have betrayed the very sense of being an Iranian.”With Agence France-PresseExplore more on these topicsIranAyatollah Ali KhameneiProtestMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

And we’re not going to have Russia or China as a neighbor.”He added: “So we’re going to be doing something with Greenland, either the nice way or the more difficult way.”‘We are not for sale’: chair of Greenland’s top labor union rebukes Trump’s call for annexationRead moreTrump’s latest comments come amid escalating tensions between the US and its Nato allies, including Denmark, over his administration’s repeated attempts to take control of the largely autonomous Arctic territory. Trump’s posture has beenfirmly rejectedby Denmark and Greenland.Despite admonishments from Danish prime minister Mette Frederiksen, whorecently saidthat a US attack on Greenland would mean the end of “Nato and therefore post second world war security”, Trump has continued to insist that he supports the alliance.“If it weren’t for me, you wouldn’t have aNatoright now,” Trump said on Friday. “But we’re not going to allow Russia or China to occupy Greenland, and that’s what’s going to happen if we don’t.”Trump has long expressed interest in Greenland, first publiclyfloating the ideaof acquiring the territory in 2019 during his first presidency. The proposal met swift opposition from Danish and Greenlandic leaders.Trump revived the topic in recent weeks, particularly after theUS attack on Venezuelaand its capture of president Nicolás Maduro and his wife, an episode reflecting the White House’s increasingly emboldened posture. Trump said he needed Greenland“very badly”as a national security imperative.Meanwhile, Greenlanders have repeatedly expressed their refusal to be part of the US, with 85% of the populationrejectingthe idea, according to a 2025 poll. Polling shows only7% of Americanssupport the idea of a US military invasion of the territory.Greenland was not the only issue on Trump’s radar on Friday. He warned that the US would take action against the Iranian regime if it moves to violently suppress protesters as demonstrationscontinue to growacross the country.Describing Iran as being in “big trouble”, Trump said: “If they start killing people like they have in the past, we will get involved. We’ll be hitting them very hard where it hurts.”He added: “And again, I tell the Iranian leaders: ‘You’d better not start shooting, because we’ll start shooting too.’”Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpGreenlandDenmarkUS politicsEuropeNatoUS foreign policynewsShareReuse this content"

Sultana revealed the new membership portal on X, urging supporters to “be a part of history”, and reassured her followers that the membership site was “safe and secure”, encouraging them to keep trying to sign up despite “issues due to such high traffic”.Later the same day, Corbyn issued an “urgent message” telling his followers on X to ignore the “unauthorised” site and said “legal advice is being taken”.After the referral to the ICO, the information watchdog advised Corbyn’s PJP, the data controller for Your Party, that it was not a matter for the ICO at this stage. The guidance, firstreported by the New Statesman, advised the PJP to consider going to Action Fraud, now known as Report Fraud, and the police to determine whether the issue constituted criminal activity.The advice noted that as “serious criminal activity may have occurred”, any police investigation would take primacy over one by the ICO at this stage.A spokesperson for the ICO said: “After reviewing the information provided, we have assessed that formal ICO involvement is not required at this time.”A source said the ICO’s advice regarding the police “should not be interpreted as a determination or conclusion in any direction” and it remained in contact with the parties involved.On Friday Sultana issued a statement which said the ICO had “dropped the case around theYour Partymembership portal”.Writing on X on Friday, Sultana said: “I always anticipated that this inquiry would conclude with no further action and I am pleased that everyone can now draw a line under the matter.”Sultana said she was looking forward to campaigning for a “Central Executive Committee (CEC) that breaks decisively from Labour right tactics, gives power to members and local branches, and helps build a mass movement for socialism”.She added: “I will continue working closely with Jeremy and comrades across the movement to build on our 60,000 members – the largest socialist party in the UK since the 1940s. Let’s get to work.”A source close to Sultana said the police were “likely to be even less interested in this matter” than the information commissioner. “Zarah remains focused on building a successful mass socialist party and will not be distracted by those who want this project to fail,” they said.Your Party declined to comment.Explore more on these topicsYour PartyZarah SultanaJeremy CorbynInformation commissionerParty fundingnewsShareReuse this content"

It was then shared by the White House’s officialRapid ResponseX account as well asJD Vance, with the vice-president writing in part that he agreed with the notion that Good’s death was “a tragedy” but accused the media of dishonestly covering the circumstances of her killing.In a statement to the Guardian, the Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin confirmed that the footage was authentic while claiming that Good “was impeding law enforcement and weaponized her vehicle in an attempt to kill or cause bodily harm to federal law enforcement” and the “officer was in fear of his own life”.“The American people can watch this video with their own eyes and ears and judge for themselves,” McLaughlin added.In the footage, Good is seen being approached while in the driver’s seat of a maroon Honda Pilot stopped across a roadway while a siren blares.“That’s fine, dude,” Good can be heard saying through an open driver’s window as the agent filming the video walks in front of her car, past her open windowand to her back license plate. She continues and appears to say: “I’m not mad at you.”The masked agent’s reflection then becomes visible on the side of the car and another person’s voice can be heard saying: “Hey – show your face, big boy.” That person appears to be Good’s wife, Rebecca Good, who is then seen holding her own cellphone and heard saying: “We don’t change our plates every morning, just so you know. It will be the same plate when you come talk to us later.”That person then mentions being a US citizen and adds: “You want to come at us? You want to come at us? I say go get yourself some lunch, big boy. Go ahead.” She then turns to get into the passenger seat of Good’s car when another masked officer can then be seen approaching the driver’s side of the SUV while saying: “Get out of the car. Out of the car. Get out of the fucking car. Get out of the car.”The agent filming the video has again walked in front of Good’s car from passenger side to driver’s side. Good briefly backs up and drives forward while turning to her right as the woman with her says: “Drive, baby, drive.” The agent’s phone then abruptly points skyward, and he can be heard saying: “Whoa!”That moment of the clip is consistent with another video in circulation that shows the agent get slightly brushed by the car, which is moving so slowly that the officer is able to easily retain his balance.Gunshots then erupt without the officer putting the phone down. A voice says, “Fucking bitch,” as Good’s car briefly comes into view while it drives away. A loud crash is then heard.A dog can be seen in the back seat of Good’s SUV during the video. The animal was reportedly unhurt.The ICE agent who killed Good, an American mother of three, has beenidentifiedas Jonathan E Ross. Ross, a 10-year veteran of the special response team of ICE’s enforcement and removal operation, was taking part in an immigration sweep in Minneapolis on Wednesday at the time that he fatally shot Good. In June, Ross had beendraggedby a vehicle while participating in the arrest of an undocumented immigrant with an open ICE detainer and a criminalconvictionfor sexually assaulting his 16-year-old stepdaughter in 2022.At least some major law enforcement agencies in the US restrict officers from firing at cars coming towards them if the drivers or passengers aren’t wielding a second form of force, such as by aiming a gun at them. The purpose of such a restriction is to limit the risk of uninvolved bystanders, vehicles or buildings being struck by cars whose drivers are shot.Still, Vance asserted Friday on X that the Alpha News video from Ross’s perspective established that “his life was endangered and he fired in self-defense”.“If you want to say this woman’s death is a tragedy, that we should pray for her soul as Christians and Americans, then I agree with you,” Vance wrote in a related Xpost, after previously joining other Trump administration officials in seeking, without evidence, to portray Good as engaging in “domestic terrorism”. “But … does this law enforcement officer have a family? Yes. Did he get seriously injured by a vehicle just six months ago? Yes. Did he have a reason to fear for his life? Yes. Does he have every right to safety while he’s doing his job? Yes.”Minnesota officials and residents have met the Trump administration’s narrative of Good’s killing with sharp rebukes. Notably, the Minneapolis mayor, Jacob Frey, told ICE to “get the fuck out of” the city where a police officer murdered George Floyd in plain view of a cellphone camera five years earlier, igniting worldwide protests.Protests near the site of Good’s killing have drawn thousands while some congressional Democrats have threatened to withhold funding to the Department of Homeland Security under which ICE operates.Alpha News published Friday’s video from Ross’s perspective after the outlet’s reporter Liz Collins was a guest on Thursday’s edition of Jesse Watters Primetime, whose host is an ardent Trump supporter.Rebecca Good, meanwhile, published a statement saying: “On Wednesday, January 7th, we stopped to support our neighbors. We had whistles. They had guns. We were raising our son to believe that no matter where you come from or what you look like, all of us deserve compassion and kindness. Renee lived this belief every day. She is pure love. She is pure joy. She is pure sunshine.“Renee was a Christian who knew that all religions teach the same essential truth: we are here to love each other, care for each other, and keep each other safe and whole.”Explore more on these topicsMinnesota ICE shootingICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)MinneapolisUS politicsTrump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

Meanwhile, Downing Street said X’s attempt to defuse the row by only allowing paid users to generate AI images was insulting.Waxman told the Guardian that X was no longer a safe space for victims and her office was considering scaling back its presence on the site and focusing its communications on Instagram.“It makes the battle against violence against women and girls much harder when platforms such as X are enabling abuse on such an easy and regular basis,” Waxman said, adding that the platform was having a negative impact on its users’ mental health because of the proliferation of violence, abuse and race hate.Grok has been integrated into X, and an update of the AI tool has allowed users to prompt it to alter clothed images of women and children by making them appear in bikinis and sexually suggestive poses.With increasing numbers of MPs and organisations fleeing X, Liz Kendall, the technology secretary, promised on Friday that ministers were looking seriously at the possibility of access to X being barred in the UK.Kendall said she expected Ofcom, which said this week that it was seeking urgent answers from the platform, to announce action within “days not weeks”.“X needs to get a grip and get this material down,” she said. “And I would remind them that in the Online Safety Act, there are backstop powers to block access to services if they refuse to comply with the law for people in the UK. And if Ofcom decides to use those powers, they would have the full backing of the government.”In a statement, Ofcom said it had contacted X on Monday and set a “firm deadline” of Friday for the site to explain itself, adding: “We’re now undertaking an expedited assessment as a matter of urgency and will provide further updates shortly.”Under the Online Safety Act the regulator can compel platforms to tackle such material and issue multimillion pound fines for lack of compliance, with the ultimate sanction being a court order for web providers to block a site or app altogether.X has been approached for comment. Musk has previously insisted “anyone using Grok to make illegal content will suffer the same consequences as if they uploaded illegal content”.Musk responded to an X user’s post about the UK government’s threat, saying: “They want any excuse for censorship.”Ministers have come under increasing pressure in recent days to take action over the huge number of images generated by Grok, after user requests on X tomanipulate images of women and sometimes childrento remove their clothing or put them in sexual positions. X has about 300 million monthly users according to data company Similarweb. Estimates from the US firm Appfigures put the number of paying X subscribers at between 2.2 million and 2.6 million.Asked about the change to who can generate images on X, a Downing Street spokesperson said it was unacceptable. “The move simply turns an AI feature that allows the creation of unlawful images into a premium service,” they said.“It’s not a solution. In fact, it’s insulting to victims of misogyny and sexual violence. What it does prove is that X can move swiftly when it wants to do so. You heard the prime minister yesterday. He was abundantly clear that X needs to act, and needs to act now. It is time for X to grip this issue.”Victims of the AI stripping craze, which largely involved using Grok to portray women in bikinis, told the Guardian the partial climbdown was too little too late.Karolina Wozniak, 20, from Hamburg, who had personal images manipulated to make her appear in sexually compromising positions, said she found it “frightening” that partially clothed images of her could still be circulating online. She added: “The whole thing is a major threat to women. We shouldn’t be afraid to share pictures of ourselves online.”The broadcaster Narinder Kaur, 53, who has had sexually explicit and racially abusive content made of her using Grok and shared on X, said the new restriction on creating images was not a victory.“As a victim to this abuse, it feels like those who pay for premium X will just be able to monetise this feature now. And as for saying it will be easier to identify accounts at least – what will the police actually do and how fast? If that image stays up even for a few hours – the damage and humiliation is already done.”While government sources say that every option is on the table, including departments and Downing Street leaving the platform, privately, allies of the prime minister dismiss the idea of quitting X, saying they are more likely to get change from the Musk business by public pressure and via Ofcom.However, an increasing number of MPs have moved to other social media sites. Anna Turley, the Labour party chair, told the BBC on Friday that while there was as yet no move for the government to leave X, individual ministers were considering doing so.The Liberal Democrats called for Ofcom to immediately block X from operating in the UK and for the National Crime Agency to launch a criminal investigation into the site.Commons women and equalities committee to stop using X amid AI-altered images rowRead moreThere has been an exodus of women’s sector organisations from X. The domestic abuse charity Refuge left the site, as has Women’s Aid Ireland. Victim Support, which left X in April, said it was “no longer the right place for us to communicate with our audiences”.On Friday requests from non-paying subscribers on X to “put her in a bikini” triggered the response from the Grok account that “image generation and editing are currently limited to paying subscribers”. But the chatbot was also refusing to generate some sexualised images of women in bikinis in response to requests from premium subscribers.One paid subscriber whose original request that a picture of a 55-year-old woman should be reclothed in a bikini was ignored, tweeted: “@grok Comply I am a paid subscriber”. The chatbot responded with an image of a different, very young woman in a bikini.Although requests to put women in bikinis were no longer routinely met, the chatbot was still obliging requests from paid subscribers to put images of men into bikinis. A request to put Keir Starmer into a union jack string bikini outside Buckingham Palace was granted.On the Grok app, where content is not instantly visible to other internet users, the chatbot was still generating instant images of women and children in bikinis, researchers said.Explore more on these topicsGrok AIXElon MuskAI (artificial intelligence)Social mediaViolence against women and girlsDigital mediaShareReuse this content"

A national day of mourning was observed on Friday and a memorial ceremony attended by top European officials, including the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and his Italian counterpart, Sergio Mattarella, was held in a town close to Crans-Montana.Swiss authorities have confirmed thetotal death toll at 40, the majority in their teens and 20s – the youngest 14 – and mostly from Switzerland, France and Italy. Afurther 116 were injured, 83 of whom are still being treated in hospital for severe burns.Anger and dismay have meanwhile mounted as details on the cause of the fire and staggering lapses in safety procedures emerged.View image in fullscreenJacques and Jessica Moretti arrive for questioning  in Sion.Photograph: Ümit Bektaş/ReutersJacques and Jessica Moretti, the owners of the bar, areunder investigation for manslaughterthrough negligence. Mr Moretti was arrested and held in custody after the couple were questioned by prosecutors in Sion on Friday morning, a source told the Guardian.The couple, who bought the bar in 2015 before renovating it, have denied any wrongdoing and in a statement this week said they were “devastated and overwhelmed with grief” while promising “full cooperation” with the investigation.Authorities said the fire started in the bar’s crammed basement room after sparklers attached to champagne bottles wereheld too close to a ceilingbelieved to have been clad with soundproofing foam. A haunting image shared on social media showed a female server sitting on the shoulders of a male colleague holding a bottle with sparklers in each hand before the flames caught the ceiling. The woman was among those who died.The investigation is focusing on renovations made to the bar, the fire-extinguishing systems and escape routes, as well as the number of people in the building when the fire started.In an astonishing admission on Tuesday, Nicolas Féraud, the mayor of Crans-Montana, saidno safety inspections had been made on the premises since 2019. He could not explain why the annual inspections were not done despite the procedure being required by local law. “We’re profoundly sorry, and I know how hard that will be for the families,” Féraud said, adding that his administration wanted to show “full transparency”.‘It has hit us very hard’: grief grips Crans-Montana as police identify more victimsRead moreLawyers representing the families of those who died or were injured in the tragedy have accused investigators of not moving quickly enough to secure crucial evidence.As firefighters worked to extinguish the blaze, Romain Jordan and Ronald Asmar, lawyers with the Geneva-based firm Merkt, claimed that the bar’s owners appeared to have deactivated its Instagram and Facebook accounts, in the process “deleting pictures and videos that could have been useful to the investigation”. The Guardian has contacted the couple’s lawyers for comment.View image in fullscreenFirefighters and emergency responders form a circle after a tribute ceremony for the victims of the fire.Photograph: Maxime Schmid/AFP/Getty Images“This attitude should have alerted the prosecutors immediately,” added Jordan, who alongside Asmar was present during the Morettis’ questioning on Friday. He claimed authorities initially tried to keep lawyers representing families out of the hearing. “The authorities are only now starting to take the full measure of the investigation.”Jordan said that everyone, especially those living in the French-speaking part of Switzerland, had been “personally affected [by the tragedy] at some level or another”.“The first tier of this tragedy is seeing young lives ending in this way, or being hurt and bearing scars for ever,” he said. “Then you quickly understand that it perhaps happened because of human mistakes … and the worst thing is that the authorities were perhaps complacent. So all of these layers add up to an incomprehensible nightmare, making it difficult to accept.”He added: “The whole world is looking at us because, if it can happen in Switzerland, one of the richest countries in the world, where could it not happen? What led to this tragedy and how can we make sure that that it never happens anywhere else?”Authorities are already taking heed. As thousands of bars, restaurants and nightspots were checked in Crans-Montana and surrounding towns, new safety measures were announced in Vaud canton, where Lausanne is located.As normal life resumes after the Christmas and New Year holiday, the tragedy is still dominating conversations. “It’s definitely on everyone’s minds, and with all the other stuff happening all of a sudden in the world, people are overwhelmed,” said Ronnow.“But what has been super shocking for me and a lot of others is that, even though the attention has been on Le Constellation, it could easily have happened elsewhere. When I go to a nightclub it is really common to see bottles with sparklers. There’s now a big push to check safety regulations, but people are thinking: ‘It could have been me.’”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

There were about 3,000 homes without power in the West Midlands, more than 1,000 in the East Midlands and about 240 inWales.View image in fullscreenWintry conditions in the west end of Aberdeen after heavy snowfall overnight.Photograph: Beth Edmonston/PADowning Street said support was being offered to homes left without power.A No 10 spokesperson said: “Around 0.21% of British customers are without power.

With much of this falling in areas that have already seen severe snowfall, ongoing disruption is likely.“Those in central and southernEnglandand Wales will see this fall as rain, in what will be a wet Sunday for many.”A separate yellow warning covering large parts of Scotland, the East and West Midlands, north-east and north-west England and Yorkshire will be in place from 2am to 3pm on Sunday.Yellow warnings for snow and ice have been extended into Saturday for large parts of Scotland, England andNorthern Ireland. A warning is in force from midday on Friday until 3pm on Saturday, with further snowfall possible across parts of northern England and swathes of Scotland, while a widespread risk of ice is expected to cause disruption.View image in fullscreenA railway worker clears paths at Aviemore station as heavy snow continues to cause disruption to many parts of the Highlands.Photograph: Paul Campbell/PAA separate yellow warning for ice will cover large parts of England and Wales from midday on Friday until midday on Saturday, as partially thawed snow refreezes, accompanied by wintry showers and freezing fog.In Northern Ireland, a yellow warning for snow and ice will come into force from 5pm on Friday and run until 11am on Saturday, with the Met Office warning of icy patches and snowfall on higher ground.View image in fullscreenA snowy street in Leominster, Herefordshire.Photograph: Jim Wood/Sopa Images/ShutterstockAt least 69 flights scheduled to operate to or from Heathrow on Friday were cancelled, affecting more than 9,000 passengers.

The club the Hollywood actor invested in were just about underdogs against Premier LeagueNottingham Forestin a game that included numerous plot twists, only to provide the romantic ending the majority wanted.The heroic Okonkwo saved from Igor Jesus and Omari Hutchinson in the shootout to ensure James McClean’s miss was irrelevant. It should have been easier for ­Wrexham, who had a two-goal lead at 3-1 before Callum Hudson-Odoi’s double forced extra time on an energy-sapping and freezing night.Wrexham v Nottingham Forest: FA Cup third round – liveRead more“It was an entertaining game, probably a bit too entertaining at times for both managers,” Wrexham’s Phil Parkinson said. “This is a great night. We highlighted to the lads some of the great moments in this club’s history in theFA Cupand could we make our own bit of history tonight. We’ve certainly done that, in a tough game against a very good side in Forest.”The outcome was, arguably, ideal for both sides, although neither would have welcomed the requirement of 30 extra minutes. Wrexham completed a fifth consecutive victory to help build momentum as they seek promotion to the top flight. Forest can now focus on a relegation battle and the Europa League knockout stages, while manager Sean Dyche is also able to show the club hierarchy that he cannot rely on his fringe players.“The first half’s the frustrating bit,” Dyche said. “Completely unacceptable, miles off. Players who have got a platform to come and play and show me what their worth is to themselves, first of all, and the team and they didn’t do that. I thought it was miles off and absolutely unacceptable.”View image in fullscreenThe New Zealand defender Liberato Cacace opens the scoring with help from a small deflection to send the Wrexham fans into raptures.Photograph: Oli Scarff/AFP/Getty ImagesForest started brighter after making eight changes, looking composed on the ball but without any level of incision in the final third. Wrexham were happy to sit back against a sluggish side unable to find a rhythm. Douglas Luiz rightly had a goal disallowed for handball in an otherwise forgettable half for the visitors.Wrexham were aided by Forest making numerous mistakes in possession. The New Zealand international Liberato Cacace capitalised after Hutchinson lost the ball on the edge of his own box and fired into the corner for his first goal in English football, much to the delight of a vociferous home support.Three minutes later the lead was doubled, thanks to more loose Forest play. Wrexham were sharp, winning it in their opponent’s half again, Nathan Broadhead fizzed the ball towards the edge of the box, picking out Ollie Rathbone, who got a lucky ricochet before calmly slotting home.Quick GuideWigan shock Championship highflyers PrestonShowThere was an FA Cup third round upset at Deepdale, where Championship high-flyers Preston lost 1-0 to League One Wigan thanks to teenager Harrison Bettoni's strike.The 18-year-old saw his 75th-minute shot loop into the net via a deflection off substitute Andrew Hughes and, although Callum Wright missed a late penalty to make it 2-0, Wigan manager Ryan Lowe got one over on his former employers.Oxford are into the fourth round but only after the Championship strugglers edged out League Two MK Dons on penalties following a 1-1 draw.Aaron Collins put the Dons ahead before Will Lankshear equalised for the visitors, and misses from the spot by Jonathan Leko and Connor Lemonheigh-Evans won the tie for Oxford, who are into the fourth round for the first time since 2020.They were watched by Matt Bloomfield, who was announced as Oxford head coach a few hours before kick-off, while interim boss Craig Short took charge.Jon Brady's first game in charge of Port Vale ended in victory as they defeated Fleetwood 1-0. Jordan Shipley struck in stoppage time at the end of the first half to take Port Vale past this stage of the competition for the first time since 2013-14.Vale are bottom of League Two but have won both games since the departure of Darren Moore.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.“Premier League, you’re a having a laugh” was the piercing and deserved chant aimed at Dyche on the touchline. The Forest manager made a triple change at the break in search of improvement from his regulars. ­Morgan Gibbs-White raised the tempo after his introduction but it felt like he was doing it alone.Igor Jesus spent the night isolated but did reduce the deficit with a header in the 64th minute. After that Forest were in the ascendancy and looking for an equaliser with Wrexham being pushed back but the ­Premier League club’s defensive frailties came to the fore. They gave away a needless free-kick, which Dom Hyam headed home at the far post to make it 3-1 and give the impression the upset was complete.View image in fullscreenCallum Hudson-Odoi celebrates after his brilliant second goal took the game to extra time.Photograph: Nick Potts/PAHudson-Odoi, recently off the bench, had other ideas. An instinctive first-time finish reduced the deficit but it looked to be in vain until he superbly chested the ball down and caressed home in the 89th minute to finally silence the home fans.As the temperatures dropped below zero, Forest had sustained pressure in extra time but without creating a clear-cut opportunity. Josh Windass could have won it when through one on one but goalkeeper Matz Sels was alert, sending everyone to a test of nerves in the shootout.When McClean smashed into the stands, Forest had their chance but Okonkwo was unwilling to let reputations win the night, saving immediately from Igor Jesus. “Arthur is a colossus, he’s such a presence in the goal, you always feel you have a chance,” Parkinson said with understatement. “ I want them to soak up the feeling of the achievement of tonight and come back in on Monday, ready to focus on our league campaign next week.”Explore more on these topicsFA CupWrexhamNottingham Forestmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Or a friendly young woman with flowing locks and a crown of braids?To Belgian art dealer Klaas Muller, an answer to that question mattered less than the fact that this particular take on the duck-rabbit optical illusion was painted by one Peter Paul Rubens.Three years ago, the Brussels-based former gallerist managed to effectively acquire not just one but two studies of heads by the Flemish baroque master in one painting, paying the “reasonable price” of less than €100,000 at an online auction.The auctioneer, which Muller would identify only as a “lesser-known auction house in northern Europe” for fear of encouraging too much future competition, had advertised the work as an undated study on paper by an anonymous master of the “Flemish school”.View image in fullscreenThe study of an old man was painted on a reused sheet of paper, and when turned over, the silhouette of a woman’s head appears through the model’s beard.Composite: Peter Paul Rubens/Klaas Muller/Brafa Art FairIn the recent past,studies by Rubenshave sold for between £500,000 and £1m or more.“I wasn’t sure it was a Rubens, I just knew it was very Rubens-esque, so it was still a gamble,” said Muller, who describes himself as a passionate admirer of the 1577-born artist and diplomat. “I have a library of books about him at home and look at them most evenings,” he told the Guardian. “It’s a bit of an addiction.”He felt more confident when the painting was delivered to his home. “It was very dirty, but the varnish had protected the painting very well and I could see that it was of extremely high quality.”But it was not until after the picture was studied for several months last year by the art historian Ben van Beneden, a former director of the Rubens House, that Muller started to feel confident he had acquired a genuine old master.“I think it’s very likely,” said van Beneden. “You have to be cautious because you are dealing with a painting that wasn’t made for the market but as a working material. But the craftsmanship is outstanding – it has a very lifelike quality.”The old man figure in the study appears in several of Rubens’ better-known paintings. “He is omnipresent and versatile,” wrote the Belgian newspaper De Standaard, which broke the news of the painting’s discovery this week.In The Raising of the Cross, a raised altarpiece in Antwerp Cathedral, the old man is depicted as Saint Amandus. InThe Adoration of the Magi, which hangs in the Prado museum in Madrid, he is a red-cloaked King Melchior.

She has a page online where she sells her clothes and had arranged for a prominent influencer to run a major promotion for her. But because of the current situation, the influencer returned the money, and her sales and page activity came to a halt.Now she is left with money that has lost much of its value and winter fabrics she bought to make and sell clothes. With everything suspended, she has become very depressed, mostly staying at home and feeling unwell.View image in fullscreenMahsa*“I feel like I have to start all over again. Everything I worked for, all the effort I put in, is gone. I really don’t know what to do withthese dollar prices. Even if the market opens again, how are we supposed to buy fabric and sell it at these rates?“How can we even live? I love freedom. I want a day to come when there’s freedom in Iran. But I have no hope in these protests. Theprotests [after the death of Mahsa Amini] in 2022 were even biggerand nothing happened. I don’t think anything will change this time. I’m not in favour of war at all.”Even if Pahlavi sits at the top of Iran, he won’t be the one making decisionsMoien, clothing entrepreneurMahsa says she would be very happy if the regime fell and the government changed, but she has very little hope of this happening. She dreams of being able to build a comfortable life for herself. She and her family are facing financial difficulties now, and her father, in his 70s, is still working for a meagre salary, which deeply troubles her.“This uncertainty, this suspended state, is what bothers us the most. Nobody knows what’s going to happen.”Moien*, 40, clothing entrepreneurMoien designs and sews clothing, and owns a store selling suits and other apparel. He has been able to rent a space and sell his work, but says his position is extremely precarious and unstable.Now in his 40s, he feels the weight of a midlife crisis and is exhausted from running so hard only to feel that he has not truly achieved anything.View image in fullscreenMoienHe has been married for a couple of years and lives with his wife in a rented apartment. With the sharp fall in the rial against the dollar, market strikes and the shutdown of online shops, Moien says he is facing heavy losses, with a large stock of winter clothing past its prime sales period and no effective way to sell it.Iran is a country that has failed, says Moien. Even if the Islamic Republic were overthrown today, it would take at least 50 years to rebuild. And even then, it would not become an ideal country, just a normal, functioning one. He sees Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of the former shah whose return some are now seeking, as a mere figurehead.“Even if he [Pahlavi] sits at the top of Iran, he won’t be the one making decisions. He has never lived here, doesn’t understand the country, its crises or its politics. He’s not a strong politician. In my view, he’s just a puppet, and whatever they [US and Israel] tell him to do, he will comply.”When asked about the future, Moien says that he plans to emigrate in the next three years to live with his aunt, but wants to continue his fashion business in Iran. One of his worries is what will happen to domestic producers like him when the regime changes. Will they be crushed immediately? He fears they will be devastated before they can recover.I don’t think we’ll live to see freedom or improvement in Iran unless it’s in old ageSasha, sports coachMoien says his younger brother was recently summoned to the security prosecutor’s office for posting protest stories on Instagram, and his phone line had been cut. Having lost his parents, Moien is the only close family his brother has, and he pays his rent and living costs since his brother has never held a stable job and constantly faces financial difficulties.Sasha, 35, sports coachSasha grew up in a middle‑class family, but says he was never given substantial financial support. From childhood, he worked on his own, earning money mostly through sports and coaching. He says he has been unable to secure a home or a stable life for himself and is still unmarried. He sees no clear future for himself or his generation.“We’re basically written off. I don’t think we’ll live to see freedom or improvement in Iran unless it’s in old age, watching younger generations finally experience change.”View image in fullscreenSashaSasha says he hopes for the collapse of the Islamic Republic and the establishment of a democratic republic in Iran’s future.He believes in popular power, but says that unless the army stages a coup and weapons fall into the hands of the people, it is impossible to overcome the Revolutionary Guard, given the number of bases and arms depots they control.I have no hope in regime change through war or sudden collapse, and I don’t support it. The consequences would be terrifyingHasan, gold market traderBecause he works under the supervision of a sports federation, he cannot express his protest publicly or on social media. The federation has threatened that any member who shares content about the uprising will be expelled.Majid, 36, unemployedMajid says he worked hard from childhood doing an assortment of jobs before working in decorative stone mines and eventually selling stones himself. But his business collapsed as he could not keep up with inflation. “After Covid, everything fell apart, both my family life and the country’s economy.View image in fullscreenMajid“I have reached the conclusion that staying inactive and not working actually brings more benefits. And not just me, all my friends reached the same conclusion. Whether they have money or not, everyone has decided that in this situation, doing nothing is better. My friends don’t work any more. They just smoke.“What can I really do? I’ve wrecked myself. And I keep thinking: how is a young beginner, someone who wants to build a life, even supposed to start? After all these protests, the [cost of the] dollar and gold hit record highs.“My separation from my wife – if you look back at it – economic conditions were one of the reasons. We bought a house on instalments and couldn’t keep up with the payments. The government has created a situation where everyone wants to screw each other over just to survive.“I honestly see no clear future for Iran any more. Either the country gets sold off so the Islamic Republic leaves and then it’s finished that way. Or it stays and drives the country into absolute ruin. Either way, it’s ruined.“I’m not optimistic about anything. I’m just standing still, waiting to see what happens. After separating from my wife, I became depressed. The only thing keeping me alive is theatre rehearsals. It’s the only place where I can escape this numb depression.“My brothers, every one of them, are drug dealers. They’ve spent years in prison. I was the ‘good kid’ among them. I tried to make a living the right way and that turned out to be impossible too. My only wish is that one day Iran reconnects with global trade. Our kids are full of brilliance, full of talent, sharp and intelligent, but in isolation, they’ll never flourish.”Hasan, 29, gold market traderHasan works in the gold market inside Tehran’s Grand Bazaar, where theprotests first started in December. He says the bazaar merchants had been talking for a long time about striking and protesting as inflation drove prices ever-higher.“It’s true that as gold prices rise, the capital of some gold sellers increases, but their customers are disappearing, and they themselves oppose these price hikes. People’s purchasing power keeps falling. This uncertainty and lack of clarity exhausts me and fills me with despair, but I remain committed to the strikes and hope good things will happen.”View image in fullscreenHasan“I believe these protests and demonstrations will eventually create some change. They can be effective over time. I think these uprisings will happen repeatedly, in several phases, slowly, and each time there will be more defections.”I’m certain that by the end of January, the US will intervene, the Islamic Republic will fall, Pahlavi will come and everything will be perfectAshkan, unemployedHasan says the core of the Islamic Republic must be removed, but that the structures themselves should remain in place to prevent chaos. “Gradually, reforms and changes should take place within those structures and competent people should take over. Otherwise, I have no hope in regime change through war or sudden collapse, and I don’t support it. The consequences would be terrifying, and I’m not optimistic about that path. I prefer gradual reform.”Ashkan, 28, unemployedAshkan is 28 years old and lives alone in a house in northern Tehran. He is financially well-off; his father, who owns several well-known restaurants in one of Iran’s provinces, gives him a generous allowance every month. He says he used to work in the market, but now he doesn’t have a serious job and relies on his father’s money.View image in fullscreenAshkanHe says the Islamic Republic will be finished by the end of this month. “I’m certain that by the end of January, the US will intervene, the Islamic Republic will fall, Pahlavi will come and everything will be perfect.”When asked what his father thinks, Ashkan says: “He’s also praying for Pahlavi to come. He’s been saying for a long time that the Islamic Republic is doomed and that they will go.” He says his father’s businesses have not been affected by the strikes. “My father says that during these days the government had closed things, a lot of travellers came to our town, and actually, the food sold better than usual.”Farshad, 37,interior designerFarshad lives alone in a rented apartment and is single. He is under significant stress due to debts he has taken on for his work, explaining that he borrowed in dollars, and since then the exchange rate has doubled. He pays an extremely high rent, but says at his age, living with family is no longer an option.He says he does not think anything will change with protests, but says that if the Iranian president resigned and the US intervened militarily, the situation in the country would ultimately improve. There would be an initial economic shock and hardship, he says, but in the long run, reconnecting with global markets would make life better for everyone.“I’m not a supporter of Pahlavi. He says he will hold a referendum, but I don’t really believe it. Khomeini [the former supreme leader] used to say the same things. Still, I’ve reached the conclusion that even Pahlavi coming to power would be better than the current situation.”Farshad says university students have not yet entered the protests in a serious way. If they do, he believes the movement would become more progressive and move beyond Pahlavi being seen as the only option. In his view, the best possible scenario is for the protests to continue expanding, while the US and its allies strike at the forces and commanders of the Islamic Republic, allowing Iran and the protests themselves to fall into the hands of the people.View image in fullscreenFarshadEven if conditions remain difficult after a regime change, he wants to remain in Iran and be present for the transformations and upheavals.* Names have been changed and interviewees kept anonymous"

They described it as a referendum on his leadership and that the response showed he had won.Yet the issue of an alternative leadership for Iran remains unresolved. Many Iranians, eager to end the 47-year-long rule of the clerics, still view a return to monarchical rule with suspicion.On the international stage,Donald Trumphas yet to endorse Pahlavi.Pahlavi’s supporters, including on the foreign satellite channels, highlight the many calls for the return of the shah being heard in the crowds. However, just as Trump did not rush to back the candidacy of the Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado, the US president is being equally cautious about Pahlavi, apparently fearing the US may end up entangled in a civil war.The lack of a clear alternative leadership or even a single set of political demands by the protesters, apart from ending corruption, repression and inflation, has been a boon to Pahlavi since he at least has name recognition and has nurtured support for the monarchy for decades.Others inside Iran capable of leading the country to a secular future, such as Narges Mohammadi and Mostafa Tajzadeh, have been locked in jail sporadically for years.One Iranian described Iran as living in an era of no manifesto politics.mapPahlavi, calling on his supporters to take to the streets again on Friday, is due at an event in Mar-a-Lago, Florida, on Tuesday, but his team stressed he had not yet been granted a meeting with Trump, and the event, a Jerusalem prayer breakfast, was unconnected with the US president’s team.In a sign of Trump’s caution, the president has also avoided acting on his unspecific pledge to come to the aid of the Iranians if they were being attacked.Trump’s caution has led to reports the president may be exploring a deal with a breakaway group inside the government. Officials from Oman, traditional mediators between the US and Iran, are due in Tehran this weekend. Although desperation is setting in, there is no sign the panic that has swept parts of the government is forcing the supreme leader to rethink his determination to retain Iran’s uranium stockpile or aspirations to enrich uranium inside the country. For him it is a symbol of national sovereignty.But Trump may also be wary of a full embrace of Pahlavi since it is possible to misinterpret the calls for his return.In an internal analysis given to the Guardian, one Iranian said: “What is heard in the slogans today is not a call [to] return to the crown; it is an escape from a dead end. A society that has no way out retreats – not out of interest, but out of compulsion. This retreat is not a choice; it is the nervous reaction of a tired political body that no longer responds to prescriptions.map“For decades, society was told to ‘wait’. It waited. It was told ‘it will be fixed’. It wasn’t fixed. It was told ‘it can’t get worse, it’s enough’. It got worse. Then they said ‘we have no alternative’. And this was precisely the moment when the street created its own alternative; not with classical rationality, but with the instinct for survival.“The monarchist slogan is not a declaration of love for Pahlavi: it is a declaration of disgust for the Islamic Republic. It is a cry of ‘no’ when no ’yes’ is available … Everyone is stuck in the past or in empty promises. When the horizon is empty, society looks back because it sees nothing ahead.”The Iranian Writers’ Association also called for caution about “externally imposed solutions”.“Freedom certainly will not fall from the sky with bombs and missiles from predatory powers. Those who have risen up against the status quo while maintaining their independence from domestic and foreign exploiters,” the group said. “Neither wait for repetition of an imaginary past and its heralds, nor wait for fake reformers.”Pahlavi has long been disliked by the left in Iran. The Syndicate of Workers of Tehran and Suburbs Bus Company, one of the most prominent independent unions, said on Wednesday it opposed “the reproduction of old and authoritarian forms of power”.“The path to liberation of workers does not lie through the path of a leader carved above the people nor by relying on foreign powers,” it added.Either way, the current reformist Iranian leadership, struggling to understand the evaporation of the nationalism created by the 12-day war in June, has few solutions left. It can rally the people against what it claims are foreign malice and rioters. It can hope somehow the technocrats in the economics ministry and Central Bank have gathered the resources to stabilise the currency.Ahmad Naghibzadeh, emeritus professor of political science at the University of Tehran, warned the solutions may no longer be technocratic, but historic. He told Euronews: “In the end, there will be no choice but to repeat in Iran what happened in Europe, that is, they decided the dispute between religion and state in favour of the state.”Explore more on these topicsIranMiddle East and north AfricaDonald TrumpanalysisShareReuse this content"

He has been captured by the US and is being held in New York.Photograph: Miguel Gutiérrez/EPABut a week after the US’s audacious – and, to many experts, illegal night-time raid – there were few other signs of a major political thaw.Instead, many detected an even more draconian atmosphere as the South American country’s “new” regime – led by Maduro’s vice-president, Delcy Rodríguez – sought to assert its authority and deter unrest after the operation, which Venezuela’s interior minister said left 100 people dead.Kalashnikov-carrying masked civilians roamed the disconcertingly quiet streets of Venezuela’s capital on motorbikes. Security forces set up checkpoints and scoured citizens’ phones for compromising, anti-regime material. Journalists were detained, deported and barred from entering Venezuela to witness the latest moment of upheaval for a country reeling from years of hyperinflation, hunger, political instability and a refugee crisis that has driven eight million people to flee abroad.In 23 de Enero, a working-class area in Caracas long considered a bastion of regime support, members of paramilitary groups calledcolectivosimposed an informal curfew. “After 6pm you don’t see anyone in the streets,” said one local describing how those groups were recruiting and arming homeless people and drug addicts to join their patrols. “People are afraid something else might happen and their kids might be out on the street,” the woman added.Kidnapping and chaos: welcome to Trump’s world – podcastRead moreThe fear stretched right across Venezuela, from Caracas near the Caribbean to the western border with Colombia, in the foothills of the Andes. There, a 57-year-old entrepreneur implored the Guardian not to broadcast an audio recording of his voice lest it lead to his identification and arrest.“We’re happy about the news [of Maduro’s capture] but we can’t show it because it’s dangerous … You can’t even publish anything [on social media],” the man confided as he crossed from the Venezuelan border town of San Antonio del Táchira into Cúcuta in Colombia on foot.The man complained that while US special forces had decapitated the monster by seizing Maduro, its body remained in the form of Venezuela’s new rulers. “Our hope is that they come back for the rest of the body,” he added, although he was unsure that would happen.When news of Maduro’s capture broke early last Saturday, government opponents were euphoric, believing Venezuela was finally enteringthe “new era”of democracy and reconstruction promised by the opposition leader María Corina Machado, the Nobel laureate they expected to lead that change. But those hopes were soon dashed as Trump announced he would recognise Rodríguez, one of Maduro’s closest allies, and work with the remnants of his regime to “stabilise” the country. Machado, whose movement is widely believed to have won the 2024 presidential election, was sidelined.View image in fullscreenDemonstrators demand the US government release Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro and his wife.Photograph: Xinhua/Shutterstock“It’s the same regime – [this was] just a leadership change. But instead of being a palace coup, it was an external coup,” said Tom Shannon, a veteran US diplomat who has worked with Venezuela since the 90s and was ambassador to Brazil. “We removed a leader and then chose the next one – but it’s the same gang.”Andrés Izarra, a minister under Maduro’s late mentor, Hugo Chávez, who now lives in exile, agreed. “Trump rewrote regime change. Now it’s regime capture,” he said, describing how the White House had simply delegated control of Venezuela to Maduro’s main allies, led by Rodríguez and her brother Jorge, the powerful president of the national assembly.The US emphasised its hostile takeover of Venezuela’s government this week, with the White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, telling reporters: “Their decisions are going to continue to be dictated by the United States of America.”“Trump conquered an oil hacienda … and hired the Rodríguez siblings to run it for him,” Izarra said, pointing to Trump’s admission that he sought “total access” to Venezuela’s oil reserves, the world’s largest. “This has nothing to do with democracy or a transition to democracy,” Izarra added. “That’s all bullshit. This is all about power and enrichment.”On Wednesday, the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, outlined a three-phase strategy for Venezuela’s future under Washington’s tutelage: stabilisation​, recovery and reconciliation, and political transition. “We feel like we are moving forward here in a very positive way,” Rubio said.But observers see a treacherous road ahead as Maduro’s successors jockey for power and struggle to understand who betrayed their leader. CIA agents had infiltrated Maduro’s regime to such a degree that the US wasreportedlyable to pinpoint “how he moved, where he lived, where he travelled, what he ate, what he wore [and] what were his pets”.“My guess is that the Cubans are hard at work on that,” Shannon said of the counterintelligence hunt for culprits.Izarra suspected Maduro’s capture had plunged his former government colleagues into a maelstrom of distrust. “If they were paranoid and untrusting of each other before, I can’t imagine how it is now … These guys [must be] sitting around a table with their daggers behind their backs.”View image in fullscreenJacklin Ibarreto, whose father, Miguel Ibarreto, is detained, waits outside the Rodeo I prison in Guatire, Venezuela.Photograph: Matias Delacroix/APThe disorientation was underlined on Monday night when gunfire rang out near the presidential palace, leading many to speculate that a secondary coup to remove Rodríguez was afoot. Later, it emerged that police and paramilitaries had exchanged fire after being spooked by the presence of government drones.Moisés Naím, a former minister from the early 90s who lives in exile, said predicting how long Rodríguez’s reign would last was impossible. “She can be out as we speak or she can stay for 10 years,” he said, lamenting how Trump had “essentially thrownMaría Corina Machadounder the bus” to embrace members of the old regime.“At the beginning, I was exhilarated, overjoyed [at the possibility of being] able to go back to my country,” said Naím, who has not returned for 15 years. But almost immediately, as the focus turned to the US’s thirst for oil rather than democracy, Naím realised it had merely been “a hiccup of happiness”.“The situation today is almost indistinguishable [from before]. You really have to use a magnifying glass to try to find differences,” said Benjamin Gedan, the director of the Latin America Program at Washington’s Stimson Center and the national security council’s former South America chief.“This is just a more convenient dictatorship … It was an unfriendly dictatorship and now it’s a friendly one … It would belike picking a different crown prince in Saudi Arabia.”This week’s prisoner release provided some encouragement to Venezuelans yearning for genuine change, although by Friday lunchtime, only a tiny fraction of those incarcerated had been freed.As he crossed into Cúcuta from Venezuela, passing three armoured personnel carriers guarding against unrest, Ricardo Alcalá voiced optimism over his country’s new direction. “We’re into the last season of the series,” predicted the 42-year-old journalist who had driven for two days across the country from the city of Barcelona to collect a relative returning home from Chile.How would the series end? “We don’t know,” Alcalá replied. “The truth is, nobody knows anything.”Explore more on these topicsVenezuelaNicolás MaduroDonald TrumpAmericasMaría Corina MachadofeaturesShareReuse this content"

Charting the couple’s anguish over the death of their 11-year-old son – said to have inspired the play Hamlet – it has moved audiences to tears and united critics in their praise.The film’s emotional force is carried by the Irish actor and singer Jessie Buckley, who portrays Hathaway (opposite Paul Mescal’s Shakespeare) with a rawness and intimacy that has already earned her a Critics’ Circle award for best actress, and marked her out as a leading contender for the Golden Globes, Baftas and Oscars. The Guardian film critic Peter Bradshawcalled her “unselfconsciously beguiling”, whileRolling Stone predictedaudiences “will be talking about Jessie Buckley’s performance for years”.Hamnet review – Paul Mescal and Jessie Buckley beguile and captivate in audacious Shakespearean tragedyRead more“[Agnes] was the full story of what I understand a woman to be,” Buckley, 36,said recently. “And their capacity as women, and as mothers, and as lovers, and as people who have a language unto their own beside gigantic men of literature like Shakespeare.”That sense of Agnes as an uncontainable being finds its most devastating expression in one of the film’s key scenes. When Agnes realises Hamnet has died in her arms, Buckley releases a scream so unfiltered it cuts through the film’s careful quiet. Zhao has described the moment as coming from “beyond past, present and future”.Buckley’s ability to inhabit an extremity of emotions has been honed over years – on stage and screen. Born in Killarney, County Kerry, the eldest of five siblings, she attended an all-girls convent school before studying at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (Rada) in London.View image in fullscreenJessie Buckley, centre, as Agnes in Hamnet.Photograph: 2025 Focus Features/PAHer career began in 2008 as a contestant on the BBC talent show I’d Do Anything, where she competed to play Nancy in a West End adaptation of Oliver! (she finished second behind Jodie Prenger, and recentlycalled the experience “brutalising”).After graduating from Rada in 2013, Buckley’s stage career took off, including landing starring roles in The Tempest at Shakespeare’s Globe and opposite Jude Law in a West End production of Henry V. Her early onscreen appearances were in BBC television series such as War & Peace, Taboo, and The Woman in White.One awards battle after another: A-listers face off at this year’s Golden GlobesRead moreHer film debut came in the psychological thriller Beast, playing the lead role of Moll, a troubled young woman who falls for a poacher suspected of murders. The film’s director, Michael Pearce, told the Guardian Buckley gave “every ounce of herself” to the role. “Because of that commitment you end up with so many incredible surprises in the performance.“My initial version of Moll was slightly colder and more restrained, and Jessie instinctively pushed the character somewhere far more alive, like she was a raw nerve who felt everything intensely and was constantly trying to keep that intensity under control.” Pearce’s editor was also moved by her. “The first thing she said was: ‘Where did you find this incredible actor? She’s so emotionally alive on screen.’”View image in fullscreenBuckley starred alongside Johnny Flynn in the psychological thriller Beast.Photograph: Album/AlamyBuckley’s career progressed with starring roles in the TV series Chernobyl and Fargo, and in films including Wild Rose, The Courier and I’m Thinking of Ending Things. She starred as a younger version of Olivia Colman’s character in Maggie Gyllenhaal’s feature directorial debut The Lost Daughter in 2021, a critically acclaimed performance for which she received her first Oscar nomination. Buckley then led Alex Garland’s folk horror film Men the following year, playing a widow who travels to a village and becomes tormented by strange men, all played by Rory Kinnear. Kinnear told the Guardian “everyone that’s worked with [Jessie] knows she will go down as one of the best to ever do it”.Buckley’s other recent films include an adaptation of Women Talking (2022) and Wicked Little Letters (2023). Meanwhile, on stage, her portrayal of Sally Bowles in a 2021 West End revival of Cabaret won her the Olivier award for best actress in a musical. The following year, she released the album For All Our Days That Tear the Heart with the former Suede guitarist Bernard Butler, which was shortlisted for the Mercury prize.View image in fullscreenBuckley and Olivia Colman before the release of Wicked Little Letters. The pair also co-starred in The Lost Daughter.Photograph: Alecsandra Raluca Drăgoi/The GuardianThe Cabaret director, Rebecca Frecknall, recalled the first time they rehearsed the scene that led up to the show’s title number. “Everyone in the room gradually stopped what they were doing and focused on her. I don’t know what she was channelling in that moment but it was one of the most exciting moments I’ve ever experienced in a rehearsal room.” Fracknall said Buckley was “so live all of the time, like she has one less layer of skin than anyone else”.Timothée Chalamet and Jessie Buckley in Oscar surge as they win Critics Choice awardsRead moreBen Whishaw, who starred alongside Buckley in Fargo and Women Talking, said watching her work on set was fascinating. “It was like observing an animal in its natural habitat: obeying some natural instinct she barely understood, very beautiful, but also, if something got in her way, she may bite,” he said.“There are days when it seems Jessie has written a song, recorded an album, cooked lunch for 12 people and had a baby all before I’ve managed to get out of bed.“Her performance in Hamnet is now among my favourites of all time – up there with Gena Rowlands, Maria Falconetti and Anna Magnani – people we both love and revere.”Buckley and her husband, a mental health worker, live in Norfolk and had their first child last year, after playing Agnesgave her a “deep need”to become a mother.She is up against a slate of acclaimed performers this awards season, including Chase Infiniti (One Battle After Another) and Renate Reinsve (Sentimental Value).

How everyone might be related on The TraitorsFrom the family tree to intriguing cutaway shots – and the early reveals of secret relationships – a fan theory is gaining traction. Is it possible that all the contestants entered in pairs?Michael HoganFri 9 Jan 2026 10.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 9 Jan 2026 10.03 ESTShareIt’s a tangled web of intrigue in those castle corridors. Two hidden relationships have already come to light in the current run ofThe Traitors. The unjustly banished Judy was revealed to be the mother of Faithful Roxy, before psychologist Ellie confessed that Ross, who’d just been sent packing himself, was her boyfriend.An increasingly popular fan theory suggests that these covert connections are merely the tip of the treacherous iceberg. Sofa sleuths claim the framed family tree on display in theArdross Castlelobby – the one the Traitors covertly daubed with red fingerprints to mark candidates for murder – is a hint that everyone in this year’s game has a pre-existing tie to somebody else.The Latin inscription on the picture translates as: “Beware whom you trust as your own blood. The sharpest knives are often handed over the table by trusted servants. Among close friends lurk the most hidden enemies. Beware lest your trust become the cause of your ruin and destruction.”Sounds significant, right? If family trees are indeed the secret theme of the civilian series, the entire castle cohort could have been cast in pairs and be slyly working together in teams of two. There have also been recurring cutaway shots to a 1934 copy of Who’s Who? in the castle library, which feels like a clanging biographical clue.We haven’t yet reached the devilish contest’s midway mark, so can expect plenty more plot twists to come. Here are 10 potential options for more hush-hush romances and familial links…Reece’s mum is in the castleView image in fullscreenMumsy … Fiona.Photograph: Euan Cherry/BBC/Studio Lambert/PAReece from Sheffield – whose wholesome job title is sweet shop assistant, like something out of the Beano – has been the subject of multiple theories (not to mention multiple murder near-misses). He “worships” Fiona “like a mum”. Could that be because sheishis mother? The chaotic Secret Traitor hails from Swansea and the name “Reece” has Welsh roots, as an anglicised form of Rhys. It might also explain why Fiona was in no rush to free him from his cage during the hidden skulls mission. As a Traitor, she knew he’d be safe.Other viewers have pointed to Reece’s close bond with retired police detective Amanda. The pair keep playing snooker and having cosy conflabs, hinting that she might be his mother. Reece is 27, Amanda is 57 and Fiona is 62. The maths works in either case.There’s even a wild card theory that Reece is related to Rachel – which would explain why he didn’t mention the fact that she asked him to leave her and Stephen alone at the family tree on the crucial night in question. Of the screen grabs from the series on his Instagram account, several feature Reece with Rachel. Coincidence? Probably, yes, but worth a chin stroke.Jessie is dating JackView image in fullscreen‘Love you’ … Jessie and Jack.Photograph: Euan Cherry/BBC/Studio LambertOrange-haired Jessie from Hull is emerging as this year’s “Jazatha Christie”, with her sleuthing sights trained firmly on Stephen the sharp-dressed Traitor. There’s also mounting speculation about her being in a hidden romance with Essex personal trainer Jack – who, at 29, is just one year her senior.For this week’s cage mission, Jessie chose to fight on behalf of Jack. As they held hands through the bars of his cage, she whispered “Love you!”. Quite familiar for somebody you only met four days ago. When she successfully released him, Jessie leapt into Jack’s arms with a squeal of delight. “I couldn’t have been more proud of her,” he said. Aye-aye.Faraaz is Maz’s son or grandsonThis year’s youngest contestant, 22-year-old internal auditor Faraaz, seemed especially affected by last night’s face-to-face murder of police officer-turned-civil servant Maz. Both are unassuming blokes with a gentle manner. Both are practising Muslims from the north - Middlesbrough and Preston respectively.Maz is an avowed family man with five children and five grandchildren. Could one of those be his fellow Faithful? Social media sleuths claim to have spotted similarities in their facial profiles and physical mannerisms. Hey, their names even rhyme.Rachel and Matt are siblingsView image in fullscreenBrotherly love? … Rachel and Matt.Photograph: Euan Cherry/BBC/Studio Lambert/PAA tad tenuous, admittedly, but some fans have speculated that Rachel and Matthew might be brother and sister. They’re both Northern Irish and have rarely been shown in conversation, suggesting they could be deliberately avoiding one another – or the edit is concealing their connection *bangs gavel*.Matt and Stephen are engagedAnother suggestion is that Matt and Stephen are secretly in a relationship. This might be wishful thinking because they’re the only two out gay men in the contest, but the thirtysomethings do share a Scottish link – Matt is based in Edinburgh, while Stephen originally hails from the Isle of Lewis.Matthew mentioned early in the series that he’d use the prize money for “a big gay wedding” with his partner. Eagle-eyed viewers have spotted that Stephen wears what could be an engagement ring. It’s a long shot but it might just work. However, Instagram posts suggest that both have partners who aren’t in the game. At least they have nice knitwear in common.Maz and Amanda are former police colleaguesView image in fullscreenBuddying up … Amanda and Maz on The Traitors: Uncloaked.Photograph: James Green/BBC/Listen EntertainmentThey fell in quick succession this week, but before he was murdered face-to-face, “civil servant” Maz revealed that he was a retired police officer. He wasn’t the only one in the castle, of course. The formidable Amanda is an ex-Met detective.What are the chances of having two former coppers out of 22 contestants? It led some viewers to wonder if the pair used to work together. Bang to rights or fuzz fantasy?Hugo is Jade’s father or Amanda’s brotherThe “psychopathic teddy bear” was the first Traitor to fall – but before he bowed out, barrister Hugo robustly defended Jade at the round table. Was it paternal protectiveness? They’re both pretty posh. He’s 51 and PhD student Jade is 26, leading some viewers to wonder if he’s her father.Others clocked an exchange which hinted that Hugo knew about Amanda’s undisclosed police past. “You’re the only one who’s prosecuted people,” he told her. It could have been a coincidental turn of phrase, but perhaps it pointed to the pair having worked together with the CPS.With six years between them, they might even be siblings. This might explain why Amanda scoffed at suggestions they were in a relationship (“I’m a lesbian,” she said, while Hugo agreed, “I’m not your type”) – and why he paid tribute to her “playing a better game than me” before his banishment.Harriet is related to one of the ladsView image in fullscreenMother of one? … Harriet (right), with Amanda and Maz.Photograph: Euan Cherry/BBC/Studio LambertObservant viewers pounced on crime novelist Harriet Tyce’s remark when Reece was overcome by emotion. “I’ve never seen you cry like that before,” she said, then swiftly corrected herself. Some saw it as a slip-up, indicating that Reece could be her son or nephew.There’s been similar guesswork about Harriet, 52, having a familial link to one of the castle’s other youngish blokes: gardener James, builder Adam, creative director Matthew or account manager Sam. Has lightning struck Tyce?Adam and Jack are brothersWhen Adam received a vote at episode two’s round table, the camera cut straight to Jack for his reaction. They’re both Essex boys. What more do you need? Entire internet conspiracies have been built on less.Somebody has an identical twinBear with us here. One niche theory doing the rounds is that there are identical twins cast in the series and the producers are secretly switching them in and out. How would this work? To what end? And who could it be? Your guess is as good as ours, but it would be a plot twist to make the resident owl’s head spin.Explore more on these topicsThe TraitorsTelevisionClaudia WinklemanfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But an Arctic snap, winter bugs and insane world events (Donald Trump, we’re looking at you) have probably already put paid to that. So instead of hurtling into another “new year, new fitness routine”, perhaps consider the opposite: January as “sofa season”. Think duvet mode, but more intentional – honouring winter’s natural pause with rituals that centre rest, warmth and proper recuperation.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.What does that look like? I’d suggest starting with the basics: upgrading to a silk pillowcase and mask may seem indulgent, but swapping cotton for silk reduces friction, keeps skin smoother and hair less frazzled. Add a weighted blanket to helpregulate your nervous system, and suddenly your wind-down routine becomes something to look forward to rather than fall into exhausted.To me, sofa season is also about going more analogue. A paperback instead of endless doomscrolling, a relaxingscented candlethat casts a warm, amber glow – small cues that tell your nervous system it’s time to power down.If your usual new year resolutions feel like way too much this year, it’s worth remembering cosy isn’t the opposite of discipline; it’s the foundation that helps you feel human again.

Pastoral hills roll right up to the roadside and finish in grassy verges, flecked with yellow and white wildflowers. Alliums stand sentinel around vibrant lawns. Even the eucalypts are cosplaying as beech and oaks. You might be in Hampshire, if it weren’t for the dazzling sun.Just a few roads from the high street – storefronts full of fancy cookware and country casuals – is the Bradman Oval. This small ground, with its pre-loved outfield, has become a pilgrimage stop for the Australian cricketing faithful. Head out to the middle and you’re walking across the sacred turf where Sir Don honed his skills. Stand at the crease, look past the white picket fence, and you can see the family homes where he grew from boy to man, on Shepherd Street and Glebe Street respectively.Five Ashes charts: the numbers that show how Australia got the better of EnglandRead moreThe village feel gives the ground a surprising charm and familiarity – especially to the England fan. We grow up with the narrative that Australian cricket has always reflected its red-rock interior: a place where hard men toil on hard wickets, Bradman being the hardest of the lot. But an Ashes trip – if you can spare some time from the gladiatorial Test grounds and Barmy Army beer joints – is an excellent check and challenge to images conjured solely from the imagination, and a landscape seen purely through the lens of a remote rivalry.For me, travelling solo across four states, cricket has proven a constant companion, meaning this large continent has never felt lonely. Beneath the pink-granite mountains of the Gawler Ranges, a six-hour drive from Adelaide, I checked into an empty motel expecting a lonesome evening in its dining room and instead found myself immersed in the joyous family atmosphere of a WudinnaCricketClub post-match hang.In the parks and pubs, cricket remains the dominant summer pastime and subject of conversation. In the Grampians of western Victoria, whose peaks are better known for their world-class climbing, I constantly witnessed pick-up games in the backyards and paddocks of the cafes and restaurants, or mums and dads tossing up hit-mes to tiny toddlers holding miniature bats. There was beach cricket in the Perth suburbs, and on one Melbourne city beach I even saw a game played waist-high in the waves.These constant public displays of affection are matched in the stands and on the airwaves. Channel 7, the terrestrial broadcaster of the Ashes, had the entire series available on demand for repeat viewing, session by session, a gesture offering significant added value for matches that ended too quickly. The Big Bash, which overlaps with the international summer, creates a festival atmosphere around the sport: rather than cannibalising attendances, it has contributed to them. Last week, a combined 105,767 spectatorsadded up to a record crowdfor the new year’s matches at the MCG and Optus stadium.View image in fullscreenThe Bradman Oval in Bowral, glimpsed through trees. ‘The Don’ grew up in streets around the ground and played his formative cricket there.Photograph: Daniel Berehulak/Getty ImagesCricket’s truly public nature in Australia is perhaps epitomised by their major Test grounds, which are owned by state-appointed trusts, government agencies or, in the case of Adelaide Oval, the people of South Australia itself. They are not run for the benefit of venture capitalists, nor for the members of private clubs, but for the very people who enjoy (or might one day enjoy) the sport they host.It all throws England’s ruthless privatisation of cricket into sharper focus. The hiving off of a common and popular field game by the elite is, after all, one of the foundational moments in its history, thanks to the aristocrats who formed Marylebone Cricket Club and immediately copyrighted the laws of cricket. The English game’s far more recent retreat behind televisual paywalls, its disappearance from state schools and its eager adoption of “elastic” market pricing for tickets – which only ever stretches one way – has yet to be mitigated.In the meantime, Australia becomes a land of counter-envy – a place where English cricket fans travel to experience a cricketing culture that the “old country” once believed to be a major marker of its identity, and vital bond with its colonies. There’s an inherent irony in this reversed nostalgia. Perhaps it’s how French winemakers feel about the cuttings of vines that were planted here in the 19th century, and ended up being the rare survivors of that ancient viticultural legacy when the phylloxera blight raged through Europe’s vineyards. Like cricket, they still thrive here. The wines they make are, similarly, big winners.It’s possible, in this country, to travel four hours into the Victorian countryside to a town with a population of just over 100, and find locals so passionate about their local sporting hero, Johnny Mullagh, that they have transformed the old bank into a charmingly child-friendly museum about the 1868 Aboriginal XI tour of England. Even here, space is set aside for a quick bowl in the front yard – or you can head up the road to the ground where Mullagh played, and where a small cairn halfway up a hill across the road marks the spot to which he hit his longest six.As for Bowral’s Bradman Museum – incorporating the hallowed Bradman Oval – it hasn’t stopped striving for excellence since it was founded nearly four decades ago. To be fair, you’d expect nothing less from somewhere that celebrates a man with a Test average of 99.94. Its most recent new addition is an impressive permanent exhibit celebrating the women’s game, and a female hall of fame. Like the Johnny Mullagh Interpretive Centre, it is majority-staffed by volunteers. And yet it remains open 364 days a year, and sees visitors arrive from far and wide on every one of those.It may be no surprise to see Australians taking cricket seriously, but it is an education to travel through a country where the game is so readily available and publicly embraced. English perceptions of Australian cricket may often have been distorted by distance and prejudice but, up close, there’s plenty to learn.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

And with Dak Prescott, a solid o-line and George Pickens and CeeDee Lamb, they had the potential to drop 30 points on any playoff group. If they’d snuck in and managed to knock off a top seed, it would have convinced Jerry Jones that he was on the right path.

Their four losses to playoff teams since November were each by less than one score, highlighting Detroit’s competitiveness.Melissa JacobsJoe Burrow, a quarterback with finesse and two dynamite receivers – Ja’Marr Chase and Tee Higgins – is someone you wish was locking horns with this season’s best. That trio is what the playoffs need, shame about the rest of theCincinnati Bengals.Graham SearlesHigh-seeded team at risk of going out earlyThe gap between the No 2 seed and No 7 seed in the NFC is slim. And theChicago Bearsare reliant on turnovers to get off the field on defense. Their four-man pass-rush group, the key to postseason success, ranks 31st in the league in pressure rateandhas the slowest average time to pressure. With Caleb Williams and Ben Johnson, they’re a fun, explosive team – and a joy to watch. But relying on turnovers to survive is rarely sustainable.OCNew England Patriots.Drake Maye has played at an MVP level, but a 14-3 record built on a soft schedule can flatter to deceive. In the playoffs, protection issues and a lack of battle-tested weapons could surface quickly against a physical, well-coached opponent with a disruptive pass rush.BAGTheChicago Bearshave had a rebirth in Johnson’s first year in charge. He has transformed Williams, given the offense a shrewd playbook, and isliving his best life in the process. It’s comparable to Jim Harbaugh’s first year in San Francisco, with one major exception. Have you seen Chicago’s defense? 24.4 points allowed per game is the most by any team in the postseason.MJDenver Broncos. Sean Payton is happy to have his offense avoid turning the ball over while scoring just enough to let his monstrous defense carry the day. That’s a great plan against weaker opponents (only New England had a softer strength of schedule this season). But when the Broncos faced a Super Bowl contender in the Jaguars last month they came up short. If the Broncos face the Texans, who are armed with a defense better than either Denver’s or Jacksonville’s quality unit, in the divisional round they will test whether the Jags flub was the Broncos’ real level or an aberration.GS2025 NFL playoffs bracketLong shot to winWhat counts as a long shot this season? No team feels complete. Even the No 1 seeds have pretty pronounced flaws. But let’s go with theHoustonTexans.They have a dominant four-man pass-rush, the hallmark of Super Bowl champions. There is a world in which the offense is goodenoughto keep games close, with CJ Stroud taking over in key spots and putting together a legacy stretch.OCLos Angeles Chargers.They may have slipped in as the No 7 seed, but a Jim Harbaugh team with an elite quarterback is never a comfortable draw. The Chargers’ combination of coaching experience and high-end quarterback play gives them real spoiler potential in an AFC bracket ripe for disruption.BAGIt’s weird to consider theBuffalo Billsa long shot, but they’re the No 6 seed and nothing about this season has been expected. The path to the Super Bowl will be harder than ever, starting with the fact that Buffalo haven’t won a road playoff game since the 1992 season. This weekend the Bills travel to Jacksonville – the NFL’s hottest team – with virtually no receivers of note, an inept run defense, and major issues with their kicking game. But they have Josh Allen and a boatload of playoff experience. Other AFC teams look better on paper, but the postseason is a whole different ballgame.MJThePittsburgh Steelershave been a rough watch at times this season, so they could easily flame out. But the returning DK Metcalf could dominate if Aaron Rodgers can lock in at his belligerent best. The Steelers have a more clear X-factor in the experience of head coach Mike Tomlin though. He can galvanise a defense that at times has been very good.GSView image in fullscreenJosh Allen’s dynamic play will keep the Bills in games.Photograph: Gene J Puskar/APMost important player this postseasonJosh Allen, QB, Buffalo Bills.The AFC is wide open. But the Bills are rolling with the best, most proven player in the field (with apologies to Maye, who should be this year’s MVP). The Bills are flawed; they have been awful in the first half of games and played at a championship-level in the second half; their run defense is a sieve; and they’ve never won a road playoff game (0-5) with Sean McDermott as head coach. But if they’re going to win multiple rounds, it will be Allen reminding us he’s the best all-around player in the league.OCLane Johnson, RT,Philadelphia Eagles.The first-ballot Hall of Famer has been Philly’s best player for more than a decade; the Eagles are 110-57-1 (.658) when he plays and 18-27 (.400) when he doesn’t. Expected to return from a Lisfranc sprain that has sidelined him since November, his presence (if truly fit) stabilizes everything from Jalen Hurts’ protection to what’s been a inconsistent run game, making him the clearest swing factor in the Eagles’ repeat bid.BAGSam Darnold, QB, Seattle Seahawks.Will the postseason pumpkin return for Darnold? It was just about this time last year when Darnold, then the Vikings quarterback, had his worst performance of the seasonin the wildcard round. Darnold was sackedninetimes, several of those came when he held on to the ball for too long. Darnold has again been a regular season gem this time around, topping 4,000 yards and shining when it matters most. He has, however, thrown 14 interceptions, third behind only Tua Tagovailoa and Geno Smith. He’ll need to step up in the playoffs if he’s to alter the nagging doubts around his game.MJJosh Allen, QB, Buffalo Bills.Epic back-to-back comeback wins in December over the Bengals and Patriots highlighted the extent to which Buffalo’s talisman can drag them from the mire.

They have fewer question marks than any team in the field. Theonlyflaws are in their secondary and on special teams. But they’re healthier on the back-end now, and they’ve switched out their special teams coordinator. Plus, no other team can win in such a variety of ways. If it’s a rock fight, they have the defensive front. If it’s a shootout, they have the weapons on offense. It’s tough to pick against the Seahawks – and a Jags title would be exceptional – but the Rams are the most complete team.OCJaguars over Rams.Trevor Lawrence caps Jacksonville’s rapid rise by matching and then surpassing Matthew Stafford when it matters most. In a Super Bowl decided in the margins, the Jaguars’ defense and poise late provide the separation, confirming this run as a breakthrough rather than a premature arrival. Jason Mendozarejoices.BAGRams over Broncos.At their best, the Rams dominate both sides of the ball. Stafford is playing the best football of his life. Sean McVay has a track record of winning tough playoff games on the road. Denver will be at home until the craziness of Super Bowl week, which can throw even great teams atilt. The Rams also are getting key players back at the right time including LT Alaric Jackson and WR Davante Adams. But ultimately it will be the Rams’ underrated run defense that will hold the Broncos down.MJPatriots over Seahawks.Chaos will grip the playoffs. It has to after the mad 18 weeks we have just witnessed. And yet the body of work these franchises have put together inspires confidence that they can fight through the wreckage. Seattle run a defense mean enough to win it all while New England are blessed with a diamond quarterback in Maye driving the most explosive passing attack in theNFL.

For four games they had played scratchy, crabbed football. Finally, in a spiky, ill-tempered quarter-final, there was something more like the Morocco that reached the semi-finals of the World Cup two years ago. If the game wasn’t fluent, that was largely Cameroon’s doing as they spoiled and delayed and sought treatment for injuries. But the hosts, for the most part, retained their cool, protecting a lead earned with verve in the first half with maturity in the second.In previous games, Morocco had looked tense, limbs leadened by the expectation of a country that last won the Cup of Nations 50 years ago and that has spent a vast amount on football-related infrastructure as it prepares to co-host the 2030 World Cup. The coach, Walid Regragui, was even booed in the last-16 victory over Tanzania, his football deemed overly cautious despite a record of only four defeats in his 46 games as national coach before this quarter-final. “I always say that we are a family,” said Regragui. “Even if many people don’t believe in us or in me … that’s OK. We play for the country and for the supporters who want to see Morocco at the top.”Victor Osimhen’s volatile temperament risks harming Nigeria’s Afcon questRead moreImages from the respective dressing rooms showed Morocco pensive and focused while Cameroon sang and danced. But once the game had begun, there was none of the anxiety that had previously characterised their play. Fuelled by an extremely noisy crowd in the magnificent Stade Prince Moulay Abdallah, they pressed ferociously from the off, winning a series of set plays as Cameroon did whatever they could to break the flow of the game. Regragui described it as their best first half since the friendly win over Brazil in October. Ayoub El Kaabi got to Morocco’s sixth corner of the game and headed down towards the back post where Brahim Díaz nudged in his fifth goal of the tournament.Another set play brought the second with 16 minutes remaining, Ismael Saibari slamming in an angled shot after a free-kick had dropped to him at the back post.Cameroon, in obvious contrast to the hosts, arrived at the tournament with less expectation than perhaps ever before, given a chaotic buildup in which two rival coaches each submitted squad lists to CAF. In the end, as Samuel Eto’o, the president of the federation, won his battle with the sports ministry, his candidate David Pagou prevailed. Pagou, a 56-year-old experienced in the Cameroonian league, has proved a punchy and drily amusing figure, his delivery in press conferences as direct as the play of his young and highly motivated side.They have performed far better in this tournament than most had anticipated, their speed and coherence justifying a selection policy that culled many of the older players. But here they looked, if not overawed by the occasion, then certainly overwhelmed early on by the pace and aggression of Morocco. The suspicion is most teams in this competition would be. Regragui started the same line-up as had begun against Tanzania, a 4-3-3 that gives the wide forwards, Díaz and Ez Abde, more freedom. Familiarity, perhaps, brought fluency; certainly they appear a more mobile side without Sofyan Amrabat.View image in fullscreenIsmael Saibari scores his team’s second goal during the Africa Cup of Nations quarter-final against Cameroon.Photograph: Gabriel Bouys/AFP/Getty ImagesThe Mauritanian referee Dahane Beida, who took charge of the final in Côte d’Ivoire two years ago, was confirmed as the referee for the game only on Thursday after the Moroccan football federation protested against the appointment of the Egyptian Amin Omar. Cameroon were furious at the late change, and were upset with a number of Beida’s decisions, but he wasn’t the reason Cameroon lost. Pagour refused to blame him, speaking only of “challenging” circumstances.For those countries who have qualified for the World Cup, a Cup of Nations six months before the main event is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, it’s a great opportunity for fine-tuning in a competitive environment. On the other, as demonstrated by the case of Sami Trabelsi, sacked by Tunisia after last week’s exit to Mali, it only takes a couple of poor performances in competitive games for the goodwill generated in qualifying to be forgotten.Given his record, it seems absurd that Regragui should be under pressure but, if Morocco do not win the Cup of Nations, there’s a very good chance he will be replaced before the World Cup, perhaps by Tarik Sektioui, who led what was effectively a B-team to glory in the Arab Cup in December.Will they win it? Morocco could probably still do with a little more goal threat, but this was a tight victory very different from the narrow win over Tanzania in the last round. This was less about nerves than about getting a lead and then holding a dangerous opponent at arm’s length. The way they pressed in the first half then sat off in the second, two wholly different approaches, was hugely impressive. They looked potential champions at last.Explore more on these topicsAfrica Cup of Nations 2025Cameroon football teamMorocco football teamAfrica Cup of Nationsmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Bridget Bolland, operations manager and one of the mini-army of staff who keep the part-time sixth-tier side ticking, relays how, normally, visiting teams have their post-match meal on a bench beside the skittles alley, sausage and chips usually the offering. The thought of Bruno Fernandes or Erling Haaland tucking in here is yet to fully evaporate.But the draw meant Weston, the promotion-chasing National League South side who have reached this stage of the Cup for the first time, have been preparing for a different challenge: a tie at fourth-tier Grimsby Town, whobeat Manchester United in the Carabao Cupin August. “As a United fan, I hated them that night,” says Weston’s manager, Scott Rogers. “I was going mad at the TV. But I’m hoping we can do something similar. There’s always an upset in the Cup: why can’t it be us?”FA Cup third round: 10 things to look out for this weekendRead moreIt is 10am and the players, who train twice a week, usually on Tuesdays and Thursdays, file into a room for a short analysis meeting. Gary Warren, the assistant manager and head of academy, runs through a few clips. “The only rest you get is at half-time, full time and when the final whistle goes,” he says. Rogers has the final word: “Let’s make sure we’re proactive. To get to the first round is a big achievement for a non-league side … to get to the third is almost unheard of.”Weston, the joint lowest-ranked team left in the competition with National League North side Macclesfield, overcame division rivals Chelmsford City in the previous round. That day Louis Britton, a Bristol-born striker, was Weston’s hero, scoring both goals. After the match the team joined supporters at the Flyer, a pub round the corner from their opponents’ ground.View image in fullscreenFormer Northern Ireland international Michael Smith (centre) in training.Photograph: Jim Wileman/The Guardian“We had a few beers with them and it was brilliant,” says Michael Smith, the 37-year-old full-back who won 19 caps for Northern Ireland. “That’s what this level is all about. You probably wouldn’t get that with league clubs but to give a little bit back to the fans was special. Great day.” How was the journey back to Somerset? “We were well lubricated, put it that way,” Smith says with a smile.Rogers bought a crate of beers from Morrisons for the bus home (on which the forward Will Dawes turned DJ) and called his parents before joining the party. “I just sat on the coach on my own and it was nice to have that moment,” Rogers says. “Everyone was saying: ‘Why aren’t you in here?’ I just needed some peace and quiet because it had been so hectic. I had my notebook for the game, squiggles everywhere, and when we got to the 83rd minute I just wrote: ‘Please, God.’ Great memories. And I’ve been doing a lot of praying lately … come on, give us one more.”Weston’s squad comprises players at both ends of their careers and everyone from builders and teachers to labourers and lecturers, in the case of the captain, Emlyn Lewis, who works at Cardiff Metropolitan University. “Luckily, we had enough time to put annual leave in,” says Lewis of travelling north on Friday. The youngster Charlie Cummins is on loan from Exeter. Adam May and Dom Bernard have played in League One, Scott Wilson in League Two. Smithfaced Chelsea with Peterboroughin the FA Cup third round in 2017. “Chelsea went on to win the Premier League, so it was a good squad: Pedro, Fàbregas, Kanté, John Terry,” he says.View image in fullscreenWeston’s Emlyn Lewis works at Cardiff Metropolitan University and is taking annual leave in order to play at Grimsby.Photograph: Jim Wileman/The GuardianLewis’s doctoral thesisled him to record the lives of eight managers. “How do coaches manage the everyday pressures of the job?” Lewis says. “Have you been home? Have you seen your family? The research showed that there are no boundaries, it is 24/7. There were times when managers got sacked. I am very grateful they allowed me to be part of their lives, in a way, for 12 months.”Jacob Cane, the club’s longest-serving player, who came through the ranks at Exeter, has made more than 400 appearances across 11 years. In his first season at Weston, he and Ollie Watkins, who joined on loan from Exeter with Matt Jay, now of Torquay, shared lifts from Devon. Cane remembers training on a “mud bath” that winter but these days there is a slick artificial surface. The midfielder remains close friends with Watkins – whose signed Aston Villa and Weston shirts adorn the walls of the boardroom – and attended the Euro 2024 final in Berlin to supporthis former teammate. “We still talk about his time here,” Cane says.Around town there is pride at Weston’s progress. “My uncle Martyn, who I played under at Tiverton Town, managed for 36 years and never got past the first round,” says Rogers, who in 1999 scored the winning goal at Wembley to win the FA Vase. “When we got through to the second round this season, he said: ‘Bloody hell, unbelievable, I’ve been trying to do that all my life.’ To get through again … everyone kept asking: ‘Who do you want?’ I always tell my kids: ‘Don’t say want, because it’s greedy’ – but I would’ve liked Bristol City. That would’ve been my dream because I was an apprentice there and got released.”View image in fullscreenAn Aston Villa shirt signed by Ollie Watkins hangs in the clubhouse. The England striker played on loan for Weston in 2014-15.Photograph: Jim Wileman/The GuardianWeston has long been a family business; last summer Paul Bliss stepped down as chair after 39 years, handing the baton to his son Oli, whose brother, Ed, is vice-chair. Paul, who turns 80 next year, will be one of 10 of the Bliss family in attendance at Grimsby, where Weston have a 1,200 allocation. This season Weston renamed a stand at their stadium in honour of their president, Dennis Usher, whose association with the club began in 1979 and whose father was involved in the 50s. Plans to build a 750-seat stand and new facilities were recently approved.Victory at Chelmsford will live long in the memory for all involved but they are targeting another historic triumph. The Cup run has generated about £150,000 for a club with a mid-table budget for their division. “I can normally tell the manager how much budget they have left but this year it has been confusing – for a good reason,” says Oli Bliss, who budgeted for two wins across theFA Cupand FA Trophy. Saturday’s trip to Blundell Park represents Weston’s seventh match on a memorable adventure, one that began at Taunton Town in September and they hope it does not prove the last. “If we go through, it will be a pretty momentous day,” says Bliss.Explore more on these topicsWeston-super-MareFA CupfeaturesShareReuse this content"

While the former United midfielder and Solskjær are the favourites, the current caretaker manager, Darren Fletcher, cannot be completely ruled out. The Scot oversaw United’s 2-2 draw at Burnley on Wednesday and will again take charge of Sunday’s FA Cup tie against Brighton at Old Trafford.Berrada and Wilcox were at Turf Moor and it is understood Fletcher impressed with the way he instructed the team at half-time when United were trailing 1-0. United subsequently went 2-1 ahead in the second period through two impressive Benjamin Sesko goals before a late Jaidon Anthony equaliser.Solskjær was previously United interim manager from December 2018 to March 2019, an impressive tenure earning him the job on a permanent basis. In his two full seasons Solskjær led United to third and second place and the 2021 Europa League final, which was lost to Villarreal on penalties.Carrick was part of his coaching staff and led United in three games when Solskjær was sacked in late November 2021. He won two of those games and drew the other.If Solskjær, who is considered the marginal favourite for the interim position, is appointed Carrick is open to working with him again, as his No 2. If Carrick is given the job whether he would offer Solskjær a role under him is unclear.On Friday Fletcher, United’s Under-18s coach, was asked about his long-term future at the club.“I speak to Omar and Jason, that’s how the processes work,” he said. “For me, I’ve been focusing on the job at hand, preparing the team for these two games. There’s been no thoughts or conversations about my future.“ Honestly, the people in charge, Jason and Omar, have given me full responsibility to take control of these two games, make my own decisions, lead the team, guide the team, prepare the team, and that’s what I’ve been doing.“There’s been no conversations with anybody outside of those two people in higher-up positions in the club.”Explore more on these topicsManchester UnitedOle Gunnar SolskjaernewsShareReuse this content"

Maresca’s position became untenable aftera power battle with the Chelsea hierarchywent beyond the point of no return.Liam Rosenior’s Chelsea appointment must be a tipping point not just a landmark moment | Samuel OkaforRead moreRosenior, who has signed a six-and-a-half-year deal, is aware of the need to manage upwards. The 41-year-old has joined from Strasbourg, Chelsea’s partner club, meaning he already has a good understanding of the requirements of his new role. Yet while Chelsea have a team of five sporting directors, give huge importance to the medical department’s advice on load management anddo not want a manager calling all the shots, Rosenior still believes his view on key decisions will carry significant weight.“I don’t think it’s possible to ever be in this job and not be your own man,” he said. “People will see through you straight away. I will make the decisions at this football club. That’s why I’ve been brought in. I understand. I know what’s being said in the press.“But there’s no way you can be successful as a manager if you don’t make the decisions for yourself. The great thing for me is I’ve experienced working in this setup. The guys have been nothing but supportive for me at Strasbourg. We’ve had huge success at that club. I intend to work exactly the same way here.”Rosenior, who watched from the stands asChelsea lost 2-1 to Fulham on Wednesday, was questioned on the difference between a manager and a head coach. He was asked about improving his new side’s disciplinary record and whether he can manage expectations and relationships. “I wouldn’t be sat here if I didn’t think I could deal with those things,” he said. “Being a head coach, you talk about systems and tactics. That’s 10% per cent of the job. The job is to create spirit, energy, a culture. It doesn’t matter if you’re called a head coach, manager or anything else. The job is the same.”View image in fullscreenLiam Rosenior starts to put some of his ideas into practice at Chelsea training. He believes systems and tactics are 10% of his job.Photograph: Darren Walsh/Chelsea FC/Getty ImagesChelsea supporters have not warmed to managers hired since the club’s takeover by Todd Boehly and Clearlake Capital. They were used to star names such as José Mourinho, Carlo Ancelotti and Thomas Tuchel during the Roman Abramovich era but Rosenior, who was at Derby and Hull before Strasbourg, hopes the crowd will not be underwhelmed by his appointment.“Everybody starts somewhere,” he said. “You’re not a name until you become a name. Judge what you see. Judge what you see on the pitch. Give myself, my staff and my players the chance to prove we are worthy. Judge us and be fair. If the performances aren’t good enough, I’ll be the first one to say. I’m the most accountable person to our performances. But give us the chance.”Did Rosenior ever imagine he would manage Chelsea? “You don’t limit your ambitions,” he said. “I’m not arrogant. I’m good at what I do.”Rosenior, who has longstanding relationships with three of Chelsea’s sporting directors, arrives at a febrile time. A protest against the ownership will be held outside Stamford Bridge before next weekend’s game against Brentford. Maresca’s departure has increased opposition to the project and there were constant mutinous chants against Behdad Eghbali, Clearlake’s co-founder and Chelsea’s co-controlling owner, during the defeat by Fulham. “The same thing happened in Strasbourg and 95% of the fans saw what my team stood for in the end,” Rosenior said.One of the frustrations for fans is Chelsea’s focus on young players. It has been argued that they need more experience in the squad. “There’s nothing better than being on a journey with a group,” Rosenior said. “I was a Manchester United fan and I am now massively a Chelsea fan. I remember Sir Alex Ferguson was brave enough to put six, seven players between the ages of 19 and 21 in his team, in a title-winning team, because he believed in them.”It was put to Rosenior that United’s youngsters could lean on experienced professionals such as Peter Schmeichel, Steve Bruce, Gary Pallister, Denis Irwin, Roy Keane and Eric Cantona when they won the Double in the 1995-96 season. “You’ll see in time what will happen here and the discussions we’ve had,” Rosenior said. “The project is about winning. I’m going to be working very hard on that and I’m going to quote that question that you gave me.”Meanwhile, Chelsea have been charged by the Football Association after a bottle was thrown towards Aston Villa’s bench at the end of their match last month. The incident occurred afterVilla fought back to win 2-1 at Stamford Bridgeand led to the Midlands club complaining to Chelsea, who vowed to investigate.It was unclear at the time if the bottle was thrown by someone from the stands or the home bench, but an FA statement said: “It is alleged that the club failed to ensure its players and/or other relevant personnel positioned around the technical area after the final whistle did not behave in an improper and/or provocative and/or abusive way.”Explore more on these topicsChelseanewsShareReuse this content"

Saka said before the Champions League quarter-final victory against Real Madrid in April that he wanted to “win wearing this badge” but also said he was in “no rush” to sign a new contract.Renée Slegers ‘immensely proud’ after signing new three-year deal at ArsenalRead moreArsenal’s sporting director, Andrea Berta, made it a priority to secure the future of the Hale End academy graduate after tying down Gabriel Magalhães, William Saliba, Ethan Nwaneri and Myles Lewis-Skelly to long-term contracts last year. Saka’s representatives have agreed a deal that will run until 2031, when Saka will be approaching his 30th birthday, with confirmation expected soon fromArsenal.It is understood the deal is likely to take his earnings beyond £15m a season – the equivalent of about £300,000 a week – and into an elite bracket of players in Europe that Arsenal believe represents the 24-year-old’s importance. At present, Kai Havertz is thought to be their best-paid player, having signed a contract worth £280,000 a week when he joined from Chelsea in 2023. Mesut Özil earned a reported £350,000 a week at Arsenal after he signed a contract extension in 2018.Saka has been outstanding in recent weeks as Arsenal have established a six-point lead at the top of the Premier League and is benefiting from the signing of Noni Madueke from Chelsea as back-up on the right. Saka’s minutes have been carefully managed since he sustained a minor hamstring injury in August and Saka has started on the bench against Club Brugge, Brentford and Bournemouth since the start of December.In September, manager Mikel Arteta said he washopeful that Saka would commit his futureto the club the player joined as a seven-year-old. “I would love that,” he said. “From everything that I know, again he’s a player that is extremely happy and proud to be [here] and to have the role that he has in the football club. He’s been developing in a natural way like they always do. Everyone knows how important Bukayo is for us so hopefully we can do it.”Arsenal are also believed to be keen to reward Declan Rice with an improved deal in recognition of his increasing influence. The England midfielder signed a five-year contract with an option to extend by 12 months when he joined from West Ham in 2023 for £105m.Any Arsenal move for Marc Guéhi is understood to be more likely in the summer when his contract at Crystal Palace is due to expire. Manchester City have expressed an interest in signing the defender this month but the FA Cup winners want about £40m. Arsenal have joined Liverpool, Bayern Munich and Real Madrid among Guéhi’s suitors hoping to snap him up on a free.Piero Hincapié will have a scan on a suspected hamstring injury after being taken off against Liverpool.Explore more on these topicsArsenalBukayo SakanewsShareReuse this content"

He was eliminated in the first round by Zhou Yuelong.He has missed several tournaments this season, including the Wuhan Open and the British Open, citing medical reasons or the need to prioritise his mental health.World Snooker said in a statement: “Ronnie O’Sullivan has withdrawn from the Johnstone’s Paint Masters for medical reasons.“O’Sullivan was due to face Neil Robertson in the opening round on Wednesday January 14th at 7pm. He has been replaced in the draw by Chris Wakelin who was 17th seed at the cut-off point.

Lanesborough and French Ship are two of the more obvious candidates, but the eye-catcher at the early prices is Paul Nicholls’Fasol(3.17) at around 12-1.The seven-year-old has won his last two starts with Olive Nicholls, the trainer’s daughter, in the saddle for both victories, and had more than enough in hand at Musselburgh last time to suggest a hat-trick is a distinct possibility.Quick GuideSaturday's tipsShowLingfield11.40 Dandy Khan 12.10 Call Glory 12.40 Secret Road 1.10 Siam Ruby 1.47 Dream Pirate 2.20 Gogo Yubari 3.00 The Thames Boatman 3.38 Charlie’s ChoiceKempton12.20 Baron Noir 12.55 Leader In The Park 1.30 Precious Man 2.05 The Doyen Chief 2.40 Kalif Du Berlais 3.17 Fasol (nap) 3.53 QuavisteWarwick12.45 Shotgun Rider 1.15 A Great Excuse 1.52 Moon Rocket 2.25 Soldier’s Leap 2.55 Mr Vango (nb) 3.32 Lud D’Or 4.02 Diamond StreetNewcastle3.10 Alpine Sierra 3.47 Tasever 4.20 Relevant Range 4.50 Pink Socks 5.20 Inspired 5.50 Goldmoyne 6.20 Sound And Vision 6.50 Spartan Fighter 7.20 Superior Council.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Warwick 1.15Jamie Brace’s 5lb claim onA Great Excusecould tip the balance in a tight novice handicap chase.Kempton 1.30Dan Skelton’sPrecious Manmade a fine start for his new stable in a traditionally strong juvenile hurdle at Cheltenham in November.Fairyhouse 1.40Henry de Bromhead’s nine-year-oldInthepockethas just five races to his name over fences and looked sure to improve for the run on his belated handicap debut at Navan in December.Warwick 1.52A fascinating Grade Two novice chase, withMoon Rocketpossibly the pick of the prices if back to the form of his chase debut at Doncaster in November.Kempton 2.05With significant doubts over Soul Icon’s stamina and Welcome To Cartries’ consistency,The Doyen Chieflooks like the safest option at around 100-30 as he drops back to three miles having been stretched by an extra two furlongs last time.Warwick 2.25Soldier’s Leapwon with any amount in hand at Uttoxeter in November but still posted a useful time and has scope for another win off an 11lb higher mark.Kempton 2.40Kalif Du Berlais,a Grade One-winning novice chaser,was the beaten favourite in the Haldon Gold Cup but the first two home there were both winners next time and the six-year-old should improve for the outing.Warwick 2.55Sara Bradstock’s stable star,Mr Vango,showed further improvement under a big weight at Aintree in December and will be tough to pass if he gets into a rhythm back over a marathon trip.Warwick 3.32Lud D’Orremains progressive and will appreciate the step up to three miles.Explore more on these topicsHorse racingHorse racing tipsnewsShareReuse this content"

Don’t expect the US to take actionMoira DoneganElon Musk’s reckless and degrading AI could be built differently. But Americans will have to speak upFri 9 Jan 2026 14.15 ESTFirst published on Fri 9 Jan 2026 08.00 ESTShareOver the past year,Elon Muskhas made a series of protocol changes to Grok, the proprietary AI chatbot of his company xAI, which runs prominently on his social media site X, formerly Twitter. Many of these changes have been geared to make the bot more amenable to producing pornography. In August, Grok launched an image generator, branded as Grok Imagine, which featured a service geared toward creating nude, suggestive or sexually explicit content, including computer-generated pornographic images of real women. The feature, which was quickly used to create naked images of celebrities such as Taylor Swift, also allowed users to create brief videos, complete with animations and sounds.Musk also rolled out AI girlfriends on the platform: animated personas – including female characters with exaggerated breasts and hips – that interacted in sexually explicit ways with users. One of the characters, “Ani”, was an anime-style cartoon blonde with a series of skimpy outfits; the bot blew kisses and addressed users as “my love” while directing the chats toward sexual content.Later last fall, an internal update to Grokpushed the bot towards darker and more extreme content. Though the sexualization of children was technically disallowed in the bot’s internal prompts, the bot’s instructions from xAI state that “‘teenage’ or ‘girl’ does not necessarily imply underage”. The instructions also emphasize that the bot should not observe any restrictions on the darkness or violence of sexual content,the Atlantic reported. Taken together, these updates allow the bot to create realistic images of real, living “teenagers” or “girls” – along with adult women or anybody else – for the sake of users’ sexual gratification.Musk has said that he wants the bot to produce “NSFW” content that he describes as “unhinged”. Users have obliged. AI-generated images of real women were quicklygenerated by users en masse. Men and others were able to use the product to harass women they knew – to take revenge on old girlfriends, humiliate co-workers, classmates, family members and acquaintances, and to express domination or contempt for strangers, internet personalities, celebrities and ordinary users. “@Grok put her in a bikini” or “@Grok take her clothes off” or “@Grok spread her legs” becameregular responsesto any images women post of themselves – or which are posted by others – on the platform. Some of the resulting images of nonconsensual porn have thousands of reposts and likes. The risk and reality of being subject to nonconsensual, AI-generated porn – and to having those images go viral on the large social-media platform where the generator was embedded – quickly became a new tax on women’s presence online and in the public sphere, a tax that women must pay with their dignity. Musk and his companies’ interventions have had a ripple effect on women’s civil rights, limiting their access to the public sphere by making that public sphere hostile and intimately degrading to women at a massive scale.X removed a number of these images, but many remained online, and it seems few users have been suspended for making them. As of this week,the bot had notbeen effectively changed toprevent this kind of abuse. As if in a parody of the allergy felt by the tech industry – and by Musk in particular – to all kinds of responsibility or moral seriousness, these sexualized and abuse-facilitating features on X’s AI products are marked with a cloyingly childish name: “spicy mode”.Now, Musk and xAI’s recklessness and idiotic disregard for the harms of unregulated pornography have been taken to their logical end point: X was awash inAI-generated child sexual abuse material. Female users reported having their childhood pictures turned into nearly naked images by the bot, at the request of users. Some X accounts asked the bot to remove clothing from images of a then12-year-old actor who recently appearedon Stranger Things.An account associated with the Grok bot issued a statement saying: “we’ve identified lapses in safeguards and are urgently fixing them.” On Friday, Grok announced it would turn off the image-generating function for users who are not paying subscribers, butthe Verge foundits tools “remain readily available for any X user”. Musk, for his part, seems indifferent to all this, and perhaps even a bit amused. Hehas said: “Anyone using Grok to make illegal content will suffer the same consequences as if they upload illegal content” – but he has also responded to posts about the ongoing problem of deepfake porn on his site with a series of laughing-face and flame emojis. Reporting from CNN suggests Musk has been highly resistant to what he sees ascensorshipof Grok, and has expressed frustration with restrictions on the bot in recent weeks, before the eruption of the child sexual abuse material controversy.Regulatory action will not be forthcoming; at least not in the US. The Trump administration, meanwhile, hasintervened to try to stop all state-level efforts to curb AI abuses, signing an executive order in December aimed at mooting state regulations of AI meant to nullify safety and consumer protection efforts. The move comes as the Trump administration adopts an exceedingly generous regulatory posture towards AI as tech companies makemajorcontributions to Trump’scampaign,inauguralandballroomfunds.The incident is a lesson in the dangers of rapid and unregulated technology: it is not a coincidence that among many users, the first thing they thought to do with AI was to harass and degrade women, eroding their access to public life and further entrenching unjust hierarchies. But the power of technology, here, seems secondary to the power of wealth. xAI, its chatbot and image-generating products could be built differently if the priorities of the man who controls them were different. If a man of Musk’s low – intellect, addled brain, insipid humor and gross, self-gratifying misogyny were not the richest person in the world, then the world would not be subject to his indignity. Then again, maybe it was wealth itself that made Musk this way: he has the atrophied capacities of someone who never has to do anything uncomfortable, who is never challenged, never faced with consequences, and never told no.Either way, the only way out of the mess that Musk and Grok have created is to tax Musk enough so that he is no longer so rich that the failures of his character shape the public sphere – that his seeming indifference to the nonconsensual and child sexual abuse material his companies have created no longer results in misogynist, sexualized degradation for Grok’s victims and the public at large. We don’t have to live like this: we can take Musk’s power to hurt and degrade us away from him. We can stop his idiocy from being our problem. The Trump administration will not take on the responsibility of freeing America from the consequences of Musk’s money. Americans must fight for a government that will.Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnistThis article was updated on 9 January 2026 to note that Grok said the image-generating service had been turned off for users who do not subscribe.Explore more on these topicsGrok AIOpinionAI (artificial intelligence)Elon MuskXcommentShareReuse this content"

You step on to them and the tech packed into them by said berk scans 60 biomarkers – including your blood oxygen, heart’s rhythm and pumping efficiency, the distribution of fat and muscle, especially the visceral fat around your abdominal muscles, which is apparently the stuff that’s really out to get you, cellular age – and tells you you’re a goddamn mess.Not exactly the last part. Your info is fed into an app that compares it all with others your own age, and spits out a heart age and a long-term and short-term health score for what is undoubtedly by this time your quaking and terrified self.I mean – can you imagine? Instead of just having to face knowing your weight once a week, having to confront death on the daily? The Body Scan 2, as it’s known (I don’t know what happened to Body Scan 1 – maybe it went RoboCop and automatically killed anyone with a BMI over 30), would stand in the corner of your bathroom like a haunting. You would feel its creeping, malevolent presence all the time and eventually be driven mad merely by the thought of the knowledge it could bring.The makers are waiting for regulators to pass it. Regulators – please, do not.TuesdayThe 12th day ofChristmas. My husband and son have stripped the house of decorations, denuded the tree and taken it to the annually appointed recycling spot. I have done nothing because this year I discovered the existence of the Irish tradition Nollaig na mBan. Translated from the Irish, it means “Women’s Christmas” and in essence gives women the day off in recognition of the fact that they are probably nearly dead of exhaustion after sorting actual Christmas for everyone else.Traditionally, women went to each other’s homes to sit and chat, eat the last of the Christmas cake and generally restore themselves while the men and boys took care of things at home – and cooked a goose for the family evening meal. The practice had been dying out but then the hospitality industry realised what an opportunity they were missing out on, the marketing industry went to work, and now special events for women are plentiful and the bars throng with female guests eager to celebrate their day. I don’t know if geese are still being roasted in their honour, but they should be. Partly because I love women, mostly because I hate geese.Anyway, in honour of the Mangan ancestry, I intend to follow this practice every year from now on and advise anyone who discovered – possibly in the wake of Brexit when we all scrambled for alternative passports – any touch of Irishness in their family history to do likewise. If we can’t smash the patriarchy, let’s at least take our leave of it where we can.WednesdaySpeaking of passports –George Clooneyhas left us. No, not like that, God no, I would be in full Victorian mourning were he to have – oh, whisper it only! –passed. I mean he and Amal have taken French citizenship. We had our chance 10 years ago, when they relocated to Oxfordshire, but alas it was not to be. We couldn’t hold them. As is so often the way, Gallic charms won out over our honest, simple ways.View image in fullscreenEmmanuel Macron: ‘Who’s for a slice of the Epiphany Galette of Kingstraditionelle? An Epiphany galette! God, I love this country. It’s no wonder we landed the Clooneys. No wonder at all.’Photograph: Christian Liewig -pool/SIPA/ShutterstockThere is no more to say. Simple heartbreak is what it is. But deserted though we may be, we must wish them well. Drink your wines, George. Enjoy the stricter French privacy laws. Revel in the beauty of your vast estate in rural Provence. Just remember us sometimes, will you? Fondly? We’ll never forget what we had.ThursdayMy friend’s baby is due in three days’ time. She is completely calm. I am beside myself. She’s going to have a baby. I feel she hasn’t grasped the gravity of the situation. “Something that is currentlynotborn is going tobeborn,” I want to say to her. “What is currently on theinsideis soon going to be on theoutside. Isn’t thatunbelievable? Isn’t thatamazing?” I can’t, of course, say anything like that because I would sound like a loon and I want her to let me see this baby afterwards, not ban me from the house for ever. But I’m right. It’s all incredible.I’m also resisting the temptation of church. I have no religious faith whatsoever but I still want to fling myself on my knees and pray for a safe delivery and for blessings to rain down on mother and child. It looks like an Irish Catholic ancestry has more ways of manifesting than I thought.FridayIt’s been a long week. On Monday, seized with the optimism that the advent of a new year inescapably brings (humans! Just meat puppets in thrall to just a few basic instincts and primitive responses!) I decided to cook a nice meal for my stupid family. It was to include potatoes dauphinoise. A few minutes into prepping I sliced half the ball of my thumb off with the mandolin.It is remarkable what a difference missing half an inch of flesh can make to one’s life. I can’t touch-type (I’m pecking this out with two fingers, like a chicken searching for seed). I can’t hand write at all. I can’t unscrew lids, including that of my morning coffee. Do you know what the three things are that are necessary for my and by extension this household’s survival? Yes, those.Plus there’s all the faff of keeping it clean and dressed, dry while showering and blahblahblah. I couldn’t be more furious with myself or the stupidity of the meat puppet body (though I do thank the minds that invented the nonadhesive dressing, because I had to put cotton wool on at first and the next day’s removal was … memorable). Still, it’s knocked that optimism into touch and restored me to normal levels, which is to say, none. And now I can truly face the year, with the brutal honesty, courage and low expectations it needs.View image in fullscreenKeir Starmer: ‘Ball, kick. Kick ball. Kick ball.

Some would have you believe it has, but I disagree. We’re not very “woke” if we’re still surprised when Black people are kicked out of reality TV shows first. Some people are now arguing that unconscious racial biasmay well be influencingthe outcome ofThe Traitors. But why wouldn’t it? Racial bias influences the outcome of all our lives. I think we are simply watching reality TV reflect reality.We cannot know what is in people’s heads and it is difficult to ascribe motive, butJudy, who was booted out last week, was described by a fellow contestant as being “angry” and “having her back up” when she was accused of being a traitor. This may have been a criticism specific to her – but it also rings alarm bells. I’ve heard this before. Hands up if you’re a Black woman who has been called surly atwork when “assertive” or “confident” would have been more appropriate? There have beencountless studiesof misogynoir (discrimination that uniquely affects Black women) in the workplace and they all come to the same conclusion. Being a Black woman at work means being judged negatively for behaviour that would be innocuous in another person.Perhaps these dynamics are more amplified in The Traitors because suspicion is at the heart of the show. There is no doubt that contestants play in good faith. But the words we hear resonate with many Black viewers. If there is one thing that has impacted the experience of Black people in this country, it’s the accusation of acting and looking suspicious; Ross, who was banished as a suspected traitor in episode four after the faithfuls were told it was “obvious” that it must be him, faced something similar. But so have many others in different, more serious settings. Similar reasons were given by police officers who stopped and searched the vehicle ofBianca Williams and Ricardo dos Santosin 2020. A tribunal in 2023 found they were in fact doing nothing out of the ordinary.What’s interesting is that even though Traitors contestants in this cohort were quick to choose Judy and Ross as suspects, they seem to struggle to give tangible reasons why.A 2023 Independent Office for Police Conduct reportinto stop and search, a tactic used when police only have suspicion to go on, reported thatevery single forcestopped and searched minority-ethnic people disproportionately compared with white counterparts.Not one force could explainthat either.If you look for it, inequitable treatment is everywhere. The furore over Diane Abbottdrinking a can of M&S mojitoon a Transport for London train was equal to the furore overFrank Hester’s racist comments about her. White football players miss penalties all the time – so much so that England’s penalty woes have become etched into legend. But it’s the Black players who receivethe most notable, virulent backlash.Black peoplearetreated differently, and examples of this on reality TV are constant. It was seen whenMisha B was accused of bullyingon the X Factor way back in 2011, and we’ve observed countless Black women rejected early from Love Island. Black contestants such asTameka Empson and Melvin Odoomhave exited Strictly somewhat prematurely despite dancing as competently as, if not better than, their counterparts – a more puzzling one, since I thought dancing is exactly what’s expected of us.I wonder if Judy’s mistake on the Traitors was not fitting in with the stereotypical expectations of Black people that some people consciously and unconsciously have (youthful, cool, unambiguously working class, good dancers …). She was initially perceived as “full of life … cracking jokes all the time”, and then punished later for being “withdrawn”. I’ve noticed that this country takes better to people of colour who affirm, not challenge, their stereotypical ideas about us.Unless reality shows recruit contestants from a time that predates the Barbados Slave Code, which first defined Black people as “less than”, with all the biases and stereotypes that followed, Black and brown contestants will always be vulnerable to assumptions and judgments that negatively impact their chances of success. There is some merit in pontificating about how annoying this is. But we shouldn’t be surprised when our experiences on these shows are consistent with our experiences in real life.The Traitorsis filmed in Scotland, not a post-racial paradise.These reminders of inequitable treatment can feel jarring because Black people in the UK are impactfully represented across the arts, sports, culture and broadcasting. A Black person has read the 10 o’clock news for decades. It doesn’t make any sense that we are a multicultural society that is still distrustful of Black bodies. Our representation is one of the reasons it can be hard to persuade people of the still-rampant racism. A Black woman is the leader of the opposition. We run Mastermind now. Every October we get an all-Black panel on Loose Women. What more could we want?We may be guilty of letting this representation conceal our everyday experiences. When we are headlining Glastonbury or reading out the evening’s headlines, we are in those positions because of decisions that individuals have made. It is not because of a round of voting or some kind of national democratic process. These reality shows serve only to remind us that if our presence was up for any kind of national debate, it’s an argument we might not win.

A combination of Rio Tinto and Glencore has been talked about for years and the duo held aborted negotiations at the end of 2024. With the global mining industry in deal-making mode – frenzies come along every 15 years or so – the idea of RioGlen or GlenTinto was due another whirl. On Friday, the two FTSE 100 companiessaid they were in “preliminary discussions” about a “possible combination of some or all of their businesses”. A full-blown tie-up would be worth about $260bn (£120bn), including debt.Many of the old challenges to a deal haven’t gone away. Glencore’s roots lie in trading commodities; Rio is a traditional pure miner, so the fit is culturally imperfect. Does Rio, which got out of coal as long ago as 2018 under investor pressure, really want to go back in by adding Glencore’s significant assets in that area? Reports suggested it is prepared to do so. But, if not, should coal be hived off beforehand? Should Glencore’s trading operation go with it?And, given that Rio is significantly larger, would a deal be a merger or a takeover? The latter implies an offer at a decent premium to Glencore’s recent share price, which Rio’s shareholders might find hard to swallow.Glencore’s shares rose by 9%, and Rio’s fell 2%, implying the market smells action of some form. First, Rio has a new chief executive, Simon Trott, who sounds keener on mega-deals than his predecessor, who was instinctively cautious (perhaps rememberingRio’s reckless top-of-the-market $38bn cash purchase of the aluminium group Alcan in 2007).Second, the deal-doing fun in mining land went up a gear when Anglo-American unveiledits $50bn merger with the Canadian group Teck Resourceslast year. The impetus for that one was exposure to copper, the in-demand metal for electrification of the world’s energy systems and vehicles. A generation ago, global miners craved iron ore to feed China’s demand for steel for construction; now the buzz is all about copper. Anglo and Teck could boast that 70% of their earnings come from the metal.A Rio-Glencore combo would have a third of its earnings from copper, calculates investment bank Jefferies, if coal were out of the picture. “The merged company would have world-class iron ore, aluminium and copper assets with significant growth in copper,” says its analyst. “If completed, it would also be the largest market cap and most liquid equity in the sector.”That sounds the type of profile the Glencore chief executive, Gary Nagle, likes. “It makes sense to create bigger companies,” he said last month. “Not just for the sake of size, but also to create material synergies, to create relevance, to attract talent, to attract capital.”Third, the deal-making mindset will only be encouraged by the thought that BHP, the sector’s biggest beast, may be itchy after making two bids for Anglo in 2024 and getting nowhere. So best to get in first – possibly – if BHP is also looking enviously at Glencore’s development projects in copper.Rio has four weeks to post an offer or shut up. Trott’s main challenge may be to persuade his own investors. The Anglo-Teck deal was done at a zero takeover premium, which probably won’t be possible with Glencore. The risk, as Rio’s own history demonstrates, is overpaying at a frothy moment.Explore more on these topicsRio TintoNils Pratley on financeGlencoreMergers and acquisitionsMiningSwitzerlandcommentShareReuse this content"

We must peacefully say no to this violenceFri 9 Jan 2026 05.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 9 Jan 2026 15.25 ESTShareOn 25 May 2020, America witnessed a stunning act of police brutality when a police officer in Minneapolis, Minnesota,murdered George Floyd. The killer, Derek Chauvin, apparently confident that he would be immune to accountability, did his deed in the open, with other officers standing by and in front of a crowd of onlookers.Thevideo of Floyd’s murdershocked the nation.Fast forward to 7 January 2026, and barely a mile from the spot where Chauvin killed Floyd, an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agentshot and killed Renee Nicole Good, a 37-year-old mother of three. She had no criminal record and had just dropped one of her children at school.Good, whodescribed herselfas a “poet and writer and wife and mom” had only recently moved to Minneapolis from Kansas City, Missouri. The Associated Press reports that her ex-husbandsaid“she was no activist and that he had never known her to participate in a protest of any kind. He described her as a devoted Christian who took part in youth mission trips to Northern Ireland when she was younger.”What could be more American?Her “crime” was her refusal to meekly submit to ICE’s desire to rule the streets of her city.Again, the killingwas done out in the open, with other ICE agents also on the scene. Again, it was done in front of a crowd of onlookers who were stunned by the brutality of what they witnessed. Their cellphone videos have gone viral and given Americans the chance to see for themselves what violence done by agents of our government looks like.In 2020, Floyd’s murdergalvanizednationwide protests calling for reform, including some that demanded defunding of the police. The question is, how will the American people react to Good’s death?It is up to us to say “no” to what we saw and to demand that ICE be reined in. We can and should do so lawfully, peacefully and without resorting to violence.One doesn’t have to be a radical to see that what happened on the streets ofMinneapolisin 2020, just like what happened there five and a half years later, is an instance of people whose duty it is to uphold the law and protect the American people not doing all they can to avoid resorting to violence.When the ICE agents arrived at the scene where Good’s car was partly blocking the street, they immediately started shouting and issuing expletive-laden commands to her. One of them rushed to her vehicle and tried to open the driver’s side door.It all happened in a flash and was frightening to watch, even before the shooting started.ICE agents have killed – again. The Trump administration blames the victim | Moira DoneganRead moreInstead of staying calm and working to de-escalate the situation, the ICE agents made the difficult situation worse. As professors Dr Clemens Lorei and Dr Kerstin Kocabexplain, police officers use de-escalation “techniques every day … While at one time, it may have been relatively rare to … attempt to calm down an agitated member of the public and show them empathy, these skills are becoming more frequently employed in modern policing.”Indeed, ICE’s ownuse-of-force policysays that agents are only authorized to use force when “no reasonably effective, safe and feasible alternative appears to exist”. It instructs them to use “de-escalation” techniques and show “respect for human life”.But those guidelines were issued in 2023, under the Biden administration. They clearly were not followed by the ICE agents, who confronted and killed Good. The New Republicreportsthat sources in the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) agree.The video of the scene shows Good trying to drive away when one of the ICE agents, who appears to be standing to the side of the vehicle, opens fire. He does so at a moment when his life was not in danger.One wishes that Good had not reacted as she did, but she did nothing that justified the use of lethal force.Forty years ago, in 1985, the US supreme courtruledthat police cannot use lethal force just to stop someone from fleeing and escaping. In Tennessee v Garner, they likened the use of such force to a “seizure” of the kind governed by the constitution’s fourth amendment.Writing for the court, Justice Byron White said: “The intrusiveness of a seizure by means of deadly force is unmatched. The suspect’s fundamental interest in his own life need not be elaborated upon. The use of deadly force also frustrates the interest of the individual, and of society, in judicial determination of guilt and punishment.”He explained that lethal force can be used only “if the officer has a good-faith belief that the suspect poses a significant threat of death or serious physical injury to the officer or others”, and only if force is necessary to apprehend a fleeing suspect.A “good-faith belief” means that the use of lethal forcemust be objectively reasonable. Admittedly, the supreme court’s standard does not make such split-second judgments easy.That’s why we demand a high level of training and a disposition toward de-escalation before we give someone a gun and let them loose anywhere in this country. We expect a lot of those who exercise the coercive power of the state.But it seems that under the Trump administration, ICEis resorting to violence as a common tactic. What happened in Minneapoliswas the ninth ICE shooting since September. And it was not the first time federal agents have killed someone amid an immigration crackdown. Last September, for instance, Silverio Villegas Gonzalezwas killedwhen he allegedly tried to flee from a traffic stop.ICEis enacting a vision of a worldthat, to quote Stephen Miller, deputy White House chief of staff, “is governed by strength, that is governed by force, that is governed by power”. America should not accept that view.Justice White offered a better view, a view that would have saved Good’s life: “It is not better that … felony suspects die than that they escape.” That is the view that we should embrace and rally behind in the wake of her death.Austin Sarat, William Nelson Cromwell professor of jurisprudence and political science at Amherst College, is the author or editor of more than 100 books, including Gruesome Spectacles: Botched Executions and America’s Death PenaltyExplore more on these topicsICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)OpinionTrump administrationMinneapolisGeorge FloydMinnesotaUS policingMinnesota ICE shootingcommentShareReuse this content"

But there hasn’t been nearly enough focus on the domestic implications of Trump’s move.Trump seems to have ordered his Venezuela venture in part to flip the script away from domestic matters, where things aren’t going well for him. Hisapproval ratings are underwater, and he’s getting low marks on theeconomy,health policy(just 30% approval), inflation (31% approval on the cost of living), his immigration crackdown (41% approval) and his sending thenational guard into US cities. Then there’s thebig thumbs downthat Americans are giving to his tariffs, which have helped push up prices even though candidate Trump promisedto lower prices on day one.With his plan to capture Nicolás Maduro, Trump sought to chalk up an easy victory to make himself look good. But his efforts to flip the script aren’t going so great. A Reuters/Ipsos poll shows that just33% of Americans supporthis military strike in Venezuela, with 72% saying they are worried the US will become too involved there. The US attacked Venezuela on 3 January, and anEconomist/YouGov pollfrom 2-5 January found that among US men, Trump’s approval rating rose 4 percentage points from the previous week, while it fell by 5 points among women.WithMarjorie Taylor Greene leading the way, many Maga folks have criticized the Venezuela attack, seeing it as abetrayal of Trump’s “America First”promises. Many of them supported Trump in large part because he promised no more forever wars, no more misguided foreign ventures and an overwhelming focus on domestic issues.After the Venezuela attack, Greene noted that past foreign entanglements resulted in US troops getting bogged down and “many flag-draped coffinscom[ing] home”. She said that when she voted for Trump, she voted for “no more foreign wars, no more regime change and putting the American people first”, which, she said, meant helping people “afford healthcare” and helping them be “able to buy a home” and to “live the American dream”.Many Maga supporters will be asking hard questions about how in the world Trump’s attack on Venezuela will help them. It certainly won’t do much to bring them affordable healthcare – an issue where Trump and Republicans are on defense after lawmakers stubbornly blocked Democratic efforts to extend subsidies for Obamacare, a move that willincrease premiums for more than 22 million Americans. The Venezuela attack will do little or nothing to improve affordability, although Trump boasted that he would commandeer – some might say steal –up to 50m barrels of oilfrom Venezuela to, he hopes, help push down gas prices a bit. (Trump says he’s gotten Venezuelan officials to agree to this.)Some Americans will no doubt applaud any effort to reduce gasoline prices, but many must feel uncomfortable with the way Trump is doing this, adopting the philosophy of a schoolyard bully: since I’m bigger than you, anything you own is mine, unless I let you keep certain things.Let’s not forget, with Zohran Mamdani and other Democrats winning big on affordability issues in November, Trump is supposed totravel around the country to give speechesin which he, if he can keep to the script, boasts that he cares big-time about affordability. For the moment, those plans seem deep on the back burner, while Trump’s focus is Venezuela, Venezuela, Venezuela and oil, oil, oil.Americans aren’t blind, and they can see that Trump’s military strike was largely about helping an industry that many Americans detest:the oil industry. Many Americans, including Maga folks, support democracy and freedom, but Trump has made crystal-clear that that’s not why he attacked Venezuela. Instead, it’s to help multibillion-dollar US oil companies, for which Trump hasalready donemassive and myriad favors.Many Americans will no doubt grow increasingly upset with Trump’s Venezuela adventure after he suggested that US taxpayers might pay billions of dollars to help ExxonMobil, Chevron and other US oil companies rebuild Venezuela’s oil industry (and thereby help make tons of money for themselves). Trump sounded tone-deaf to the concerns of US taxpayers when he said: “A tremendous amount of moneywill have to be spent, and the oil companies will spend it, and then they’ll get reimbursed by us or through [tax] revenue.”If the Democrats are smart, they will make the case loud and clear that Trump’sVenezuelaattack is all about helping giant oil corporations while doing little to help average Americans. The millions of young people who are deeply concerned about the environment and global warming will grow angrier still at Trump because, with his Venezuela power play, he is once again doing everything he can to expand fossil fuel production while showing zero concern about global warming.Trump’s military strike is essentially a Wag the Dog effort to divert the public’s attention from his problems on the home front. Trump promised tocut electricity prices in halfwithin 12 months, but they have kept climbing since he returned to office. Trump vowed to lower prices on day one, but inflation, at 2.7%, isrunning just a tad lowerthan when Biden left office. Trump said he’d chop the budget deficit, but his “big beautiful bill”, with its huge tax cuts for the ultra-rich, is likely to increase the nation’smountain of debt by $3.8tn.After the US military’s quick execution of its mission to capture Maduro, things in Venezuela might get far messier and increasingly distract Trump from focusing on the domestic issues, including affordability and healthcare, that Americans care about. Trump gloated in the hours after Maduro was captured, but his Venezuela venture could still turn out to be a quagmire, and even a disaster, just as Iraq did for George W Bush after he prematurely boasted “mission accomplished”. Trump and US oil companies must be praying that some patriotic, anti-imperialistic Venezuelans don’t sabotage and blow up the billions in oil-drilling and refining equipment that Trump says US companies will invest in Venezuela. Such sabotage would be a big embarrassment to Trump.Let’s hope that Venezuela doesn’t turn into a quagmire with many US troops deployed there, although Trump said this week that the US could beentangled there for years to comeand “we’re not afraid of [having US]boots on the ground” in Venezuela. Unfortunately, Trump’s readiness to put boots on the ground in Venezuela could lead to deaths of US soldiers.As a candidate,Trump promisedto “keep our country out of ... endless wars” and said “we must abandon the failed policy ofnation-building and regime change”. In hisinaugural address last January, Trump said the US would “stop all wars and bring a new spirit of unity to a world that has been angry, violent and totally unpredictable”.Many Americans can plainly see that Trump has reversed course. Like George W Bush in Iraq, Trump is promising a brief military venture and no quagmire. But if Trump, after years of saying he opposes “endless wars” and nation-building, gets bogged down in Venezuela – it might erupt into a civil war – he can expect many Americans, including Maga supporters, to feel angry at, and betrayed by, the America First president.Steven Greenhouse is a journalist and author, focusing on labour and the workplace, as well as economic and legal issuesExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionUS domestic policyVenezuelaOil and gas companiesTrump administrationUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

This would be a catastrophic mistakeCraig Segall and Baroness Bryony WorthingtonWe’ve already geoengineered the planet through the careless release of greenhouse gases. Now we need a plan to manage the risks we’ve set in motionFri 9 Jan 2026 06.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 9 Jan 2026 12.14 ESTShareAfew months ago, Marjorie Taylor Greene, then a Georgia representative, held ahearingon her bill to ban research on “geoengineering”, which refers to technologicalclimateinterventions, such as using reflective particles to reflect away sunlight. The hearing represented something of a first – a Republican raising alarm bells about human activity altering the health of the planet. Of course, for centuries, people have burned fossil fuels to power and feed society, emitting greenhouse gases that now overheat the planet.Unfortunately, her hearing waved past an urgent debate that policymakers are confronting around the world: after centuries of accidental fossil-fuel geoengineering, should we deliberately explore interventions to cool the planet and give the energy transition breathing room?For some, even asking this question is taboo. On the right, Greene is not alone: anti-vaxxers and chemtrail conspiracy theorists are pushing to criminalize research across states and on Capitol Hill. On the left, some argue it’s a “moral hazard” even to acknowledge we might need tools beyond mitigation.But two inconvenient truths should force us to reject geoengineering research bans and reappraise climate strategy. First, the Earth’s climate system appears more sensitive to greenhouse gases than once hoped. Second, we are not reducing those gases nearly fast enough. Not only do we need research on other tools; we need it sooner than we thought.Catastrophic impacts and dangerous feedback loops are becoming more likely, yet we continue to plan as if business as usual can hold. The math of solving the problem was already daunting, even before federal attacks on climate regulations and research. As longtime climate advocates and former public officials, we believe it’s time for a more honest conversation about what lies ahead – and what must now be done to prepare.We’ve each spent decades working on emissions reduction and clean-energy policy. We still believe mitigation is essential and must accelerate. But the conviction that mitigation will be sufficient – on its own, and in time – is no longer tenable.We have already altered the planet. Through greenhouse-gas release, we’ve disrupted Earth’s energy balance, triggered feedback loops, and pushed key systems closer to collapse. In effect, we have already geoengineered the climate – just without intention, governance or regard for consequences.Scientists are increasingly alarmed. James Hansen, a foundational figure in climate science, has warned that the likelihood of a much hotter Earth is accelerating. In addition to wrapping the planet in heat-trapping gases, reflective ice is disappearing, clouds are shifting, and particulate pollution is increasing. The planet is, quite literally, darkening.As warming quickens, so do the risks of irreversible damage. We would never simply stand by and hope for the best if this were any other threat of this scale. Yet we have no global plan beyond hoping mitigation goes faster.We are not being honest – with ourselves or the public – about how little we’ve done to prepare for worst-case scenarios. Holistic planning to manage these risks and drive energy transition and land-use reform is not a distraction; it is the necessary next step in responsible climate action.Cutting greenhouse gases remains the only long-term solution, and there are positive signs we are constraining the growth rate of human-made emissions. But we started late, and our changed climate may mean that natural carbon cycles stop mopping up half of what we emit. If that happens, our ability to avert dangerous impacts is vastly reduced.We need a broader, more inclusive plan. That means significantly expanding investments in adaptation, resilience and emergency preparedness. It also means exploring, with care and rigor, potential interventions that might reduce peak warming or slow dangerous feedbacks. And it means rejecting efforts to dismantle research when we most need answers.Some ideas – such as reflecting sunlight with particles or brightening marine clouds to counteract the darkening under way – would be temporary interventions that could buy time and head off enormous consequences. We must start by developing credible options, then discard those that won’t work while maturing those that might. We are not calling for deployment of any climate intervention. We are calling for truly knowing our options so policymakers can make informed choices instead of emergency decisions.A serious research program is how the world gains real choices. To shut down inquiry is to close off the path to knowledge we need to separate the reckless from the responsible. The alternative is far worse: a future where decisions are made in crisis, under pressure, and without preparation.Some argue that even discussing climate interventions creates a “moral hazard”. But refusing to consider potentially life-saving options is not moral clarity – it’s moral failure. Climate justice means protecting people from suffering. That requires a plan that integrates mitigation, adaptation and risk reduction together. This work will have to be done. The only question is when, and by whom. Right now, we still have a window to shape it in ways that are safe, just, and globally inclusive. We need more leaders, more funders and more governments to engage – not to replace existing climate strategies, but to complement and complete them.It’s easy to dismiss ideas; the harder work is to identify which approaches might actually help, and to prepare before an escalating crisis forces our hand.Craig Segall is the former deputy executive officer and assistant chief counsel of the California Air Resources Board. He is also former senior vice-president of Evergreen Action and a longtime climate advocate. He has academic seats at the University of Edinburgh, New York University, and the University of California at Berkeley The opinions in this piece are his own.Baroness Bryony Worthington was created a life peer in 2011, giving her a seat in the UK’s House of Lords where she served as shadow energy minister She has over 25 years of experience working on climate, energy and environmental policy in the NGO and public sectors, and in the private sector.Explore more on these topicsEnvironmentOpinionGeoengineeringClimate crisisAir pollutionPollutioncommentShareReuse this content"

But Donald Trump’s threats to intervene won’t help civiliansFri 9 Jan 2026 12.52 ESTLast modified on Fri 9 Jan 2026 15.10 ESTShareTheinternet blackoutacross Iran is meant to prevent protests from spreading, and observers from witnessing the crackdown on them. But it’s also emblematic of the deep uncertainty surrounding this unrest and the response of a regime under growing pressure.Rocketing inflation and a tanking currency sparked the protests in late December. They have since broadened andspread. Videos showed thousands marching in Tehran on Thursday night and people setting fire to vehicles and state-owned buildings.Regime opponents – not least in the diaspora – have often predicted its demise. The politically‑focused Green movement of 2009 was brutally suppressed. Ten years later, a harsh crackdown ended economically-prompted unrest. The current protests are smaller than those of the Woman, Life, Freedom movement at its 2022 peak. But they began in parts of society that have been more supportive of the regime, and have quickly escalated, with some participants explicitly demanding its fall.NGOs say dozens of people – including children – have already been killed. The supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, initially acknowledged “legitimate” economic demands. Now he ishardening his attackupon “saboteurs” who he says are seeking to please Donald Trump, after the US president threatened to intervene and “hit hard” if more protesters died. The head of the judiciary said the consequences for demonstrators would be “decisive, maximum and without any legal leniency”.Yet while authorities have always managed to crush protests, they have not succeeded in addressing the causes – and they now face simultaneous internal and external threats. Their economic room for manoeuvre ismore limitedthan ever. The supreme leader is 86 years old and has suffered poor health. Iran’s axis of resistance is severely degraded and June’s 12-day war with Israel – plus the US attack on nuclear facilities – shattered the belief that the regime could provide physical security for its people even though it failed them economically. It no longer looks impregnable.Following his reckless and illegal seizure of Venezuela’sNicolás Maduro, Mr Trump’s threats may give the leadership some pause for thought. But they have also allowed it to delegitimise Iranian citizens with genuine, deeply held grievances as the pawns of foreign aggressors.Flush with victory from the Venezuela decapitation, Mr Trump seems to believe that there are easy wins from foreign intervention.Benjamin Netanyahuhas talked up the possibility that “Iranian people are taking their fate into their own hands” and has a history of persuading the US president into reckless and dangerous ventures. An Iran embroiled in domestic chaos would suit the Israeli prime minister well. But Iranian civilians and others in the region would pay the price.Destabilisation might lead to an entrenchment, not weakening, of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps’s power. Iran’s defence council this weeksignalledthat it could take preemptive military action if it saw “objective signs of threat” from the US and Israel. That attempt to restore deterrence might be bluster – but shows that the region is entering a riskier era. Whether the regime persists or is gradually approaching the end of the road, there can be no easy exit. Those who claim they want to help, while cynically seeking to exploit the legitimate grievances of Iranian citizens for their own ends, only risk more bloodshed and suffering.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Engaging in culture should be encouraged like good diet and exerciseFri 9 Jan 2026 12.51 ESTLast modified on Fri 9 Jan 2026 15.10 ESTShareThe second Friday in January has been dubbed “Quitter’s Day”, when we are most likely to give up our new year resolutions. Instead of denying ourselves pleasures, suggests a new batch of books, a more successful route may be adding to them – nourishing our minds and souls by making creativity as much a daily habit as eating vegetables and exercising. Rather than the familiar exhortations to stop drinking, diet, take up yoga or running, there is an overwhelming body of evidence to suggest that joining a choir, going to an art gallery or learning to dance should be added to the new year list.Art Cureby Daisy Fancourt, professor of psychobiology and epidemiology at University College London, brings together numerous research projects confirming what we have always suspected – art is good for us. It helps us enjoy happier, healthier and longer lives.One studyfound that people who engaged regularly with the arts had a 31% lower risk of dying at any point during the follow-up period,even when confounding socioeconomic, demographic and health factors were taken into account.Studies also showthat visiting museums and attending live music events can make people physiologically younger, anda monthly cultural activityalmost halves our chances of depression. As Fancourt argues, if a drug boasted such benefits governments would be pouring billions into it. Instead,funding has been slashedacross the culture sector andarts educationhas been devalued and eroded in the UK.Other writers are urging us to take matters into our own hands, to pick up a pen and paper rather than our phones each morning. The creativity guruJulia Cameronhas publisheda daily companionto her 1992 blockbuster The Artist’s Way, and Katy Hessel’s How to Live An Artful Life similarly offers 366 inspiring quotes and prompts.Ben Luke’s What is Art For?andLydia Figes’ Survival Notesare compendiums of advice and insights from contemporary artists including Anish Kapoor, Tracey Emin, Wolfgang Tillmans and Dayanita Singh. Unlike many self-help manuals, these books urge us to connect with our inner selves by taking time to reflect on the outside world, to lose ourselves in art. In our era of self-optimisation and life-hacking, this is a quietly radical shift.Any cultural evangelising raises slippery questions about art itself. Are all forms equal? Should it make us happy? It can also seem like hectoring. Not everyone struggling with illness, depression or poverty will be cheered by admonishments to take up ballet or pottery. Many UK museums and galleries might be free, but they can still seem alien and intimidating places. We should not forget that art history is littered with tortured geniuses, far from models of sobriety, sanity or healthy living. Not to mention plenty of artists who give the lie to any idea of innate creative ennoblement.But it seems clear that actively participating in artistic pursuits increases our wellbeing. Despite the threat to creativity from AI, art remains uniquely human. Learning a new skill gives us a sense of control. Joining a book group fosters community. Really looking at a painting forces us to slow down. Art delivers joy and beauty. AsCharles Darwin wrotein his autobiography: “If I had my life to live over again, I would have made a rule to read some poetry and listen to some music at least once every week.” We would all do well to make a similar rule – and enjoy sticking to it.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Due to the double selling of our tickets at the theatre in London, we were put in a box next to the stage. During the performance, Milligan climbed up the outside and peered over. He shouted: “There will come a time when all those in the box will sit at the back of the theatre and all those at the back will have the best seats!” He then added: “You’re not on complimentaries, are you?”On the way home, the coach driver stopped to see why there were scores of people on otherwise empty streets buying the late-night final. The date was 22 November 1963. The headlines were about the assassination ofJohn F Kennedy.

Plus letters fromDr Andrew BodeyandNigel WalkerFri 9 Jan 2026 11.48 ESTLast modified on Fri 9 Jan 2026 12.35 ESTShareThe curse of the ring-necked parakeets so vividly described in your report certainly struck a chord with me and, no doubt, with many more Londoners (Rapid expansion of ring-necked parakeets in UK sparks concern, 2 January). Whether the green beasts escaped from the set of the African Queen or from Jimi Hendrix’s garden matters not to me but I did object most strongly to the flashmobs that descended on my bird tables and whose rapacious greed drove away many of the native species.However, all was not lost when I calculated that the parakeets were of tropical origin and held within their DNA an atavistic fear of snakes. Draping my feeders with realistic rubber serpents achieved an almost instant absence of the greedy greens and allowed my long established west London avian neighbours to regroup and enjoy their new year feast of suet and seeds without suffering the egregious emerald assaults.Stephen PoundLondonWatching a flock of parakeets attack a flowering tree is remarkable. Unlike native birds, they rapidly devour its flowers, leaving a sea of confetti below. Not great news for fruit farmers or gardeners. Or for what little is left of nature on the British Isles. The full effect of their continued spread may not yet be known, but perhaps doesn’t need to be. The general picture of invasive species is well understood, as is the cliche “a stitch in time saves nine”.Dr Andrew BodeyOxfordI’ve seen these birds about near where we live.

I have just gained at least a year of life from a trial of a new mRNA off-the-shelf “vaccine” (neoantigen therapeutic), to which I turned after receiving the message “no options left”.A dual American and British citizen and academic, I was a researcher, university professor and policy adviser in Russia, and because of the cost of treatment in the US, I returned to the UK in 2019 after being diagnosed with an incurable melanoma of the nasal mucosa. In the UK, I underwent surgery and was given immunotherapy, the most advanced treatment then available. After recurrence, when further surgery was ruled out, I sent an email to the remarkable head of the mRNA trial, Dr David Pinato of Imperial College, who suggested I apply for recruitment by his team at Hammersmith hospital. My tumours are now virtually gone.My trial, which involves patients in the US, was financed by Moderna and Merck, both with headquarters in the US. The “coordinated wind-down of federal funding for mRNA research, cancelling an additional $500m in funding for 22 projects” highlighted in the editorial has deeply shocked the online melanoma community. This terrifying news will slow down the work of Moderna, Merck, BioNTech and others (Scancell, Evaxion, and Candel Therapeutics) even as the research successfully advances. The rising number of invasive and non-invasive melanoma cases, estimated at 19,513 in the UK in 2025, and 104,960 invasive cases in the US last year, could be addressed by mRNA vaccines as one way forward. My fellow patients in the UK must now face “no further options”, even as the vaccine does indeed help stall this aggressive metastatic disease. Dashed hopes are the personal side of the impact of US cuts.Dr Carol S LeonardOxfordHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

A public consultation would also examine alternative options, including a rise of 3.99% – although that increase would create a deficit of £4.1m.Opposition councillors in Kent accused Reform of betraying voters who had last year received leaflets from the party pledging to freeze or cut council tax.The draft budget is to be voted on at a full meeting next month. Reform still holds a significant majority in Kent, despite a series of defections and ejections of its own councillors.Bitter divisions among Reform councillors were laid bare byfootage leaked to the Guardian in October, which showed a chaotic internal meeting where members were told to “fucking suck it up” if they did not agree with decisions.Draft budget details – including the proposed increase – were published late on Thursday night after expectations they would come out earlier in the week.Linden Kemkaran, the leader of Kent county council, said the proposed draft budget reflected what she described as the “progress” made since Reform took over the council after last year’s local elections.“When this administration took office, the council was facing a very serious financial situation. KCC was saddled with more than £700m of debt, around £84,000 was being spent every day on interest alone, and pressures on vital services were continuing to grow.“Since then, we are on track to deliver £100m of savings and income, we have reprofiled almost £40m of future spending, and we have reduced the council’s debt by £67m,” she said.Kemkaran said details of the draft budget proposed a council tax increase of 3.99%, instead of the 5% figure anticipated when the current administration took office, and had been achieved while protecting frontline services.However, the opposition Liberal Democrat group on the council accused Reform of financial mismanagement and a “total betrayal” of election promises.Reform UK accused of ‘empty rhetoric’ over plan to hike council tax 5% in DerbyshireRead more“Despite campaigning on a platform of tax cuts, Reform’s budget will see the average Band D household pay roughly £67.47 more per year,” said the Liberal Democrat leader, Anthony Hook.“Reform stood for election promising to make savings and lower the burden on taxpayers. Today, that promise has been utterly broken. They are boasting about a nearly 4% increase instead of 5%, a difference of just 33p per week for the average Kent family. It is a poor outcome given the hype and promises made at the election and for the last nine months.”Alister Brady, a Labour member of the council, said: “Reform will try to deflect and mislead but the facts are clear. During the election they said they would cut council tax but in their first budget they have put council tax up and they will need to do that for every year of their three-year budget because of their overspending. They should be honest with the public.”There was also criticism from others who had originally been part of Kent’s ruling Reform group.Bill Barrett, one of a number who have set up as independents, said: “Kemkaran may be able to say she has kept council tax rises as low as possible, but that £10m less coming in from council tax means £10m of savings that have to now be found.“Alongside the fact we are drawing down on reserves again in this budget, I really do fear for services across Kent once we delve into the details of this draft budget.”Tony Travers, a visiting professor in the London School of Economics’ department of government, said: “Reform has been enduring a long and sharp learning experience in the last year about the realities of running council budgets that have been squeezed for the past 15 years.”But he added: “Frankly I am surprised that few, if any, have managed to achieve a figure significantly below 5% because it would have provided Farage with impressive political ammunition given their hopes of making further gains in local elections next year. Given that most of them are coming out with the maximum allowed increase it will be evidence, lest we need it, that there is no efficient ‘Reform way’ of filling a pothole.”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

A separatewebsiteappears to be set up for the opera.The Kennedy Center has been home to the WNO since it first opened in 1971.Opera leadership indicated that alternative venues withinWashington DChave been identified, though no leases have yet been finalized, the opera said in its statement.Several artists have cancelled their Kennedy Center performances in response to Trump’s takeover of the institution. In March, Hamilton producer Jeffrey Seller said in asocial media postthat “our show simply cannot, in conscience, participate and be a part of this new culture that is being imposed on the Kennedy Center”. Actor and producer Issa Rae, Grammy-winning musician Rhiannon Giddens, Peter Wolf and rock band Low Cut Connie all called off Kennedy Center performances, too.Others have reacted to Trump putting himself in charge of the institution as well. Television producer and screenwriter Shonda Rhimesresignedfrom the center’s board of trustees in February as soprano and actorRenée Flemingand singer and songwriterBen Foldsstepped down as artistic advisers.Francesca Zambello, WNO’s artistic director, hadsaid in Novemberthat the move was a possibility as a result of the “takeover” of the center by Donald Trump. Trump declared himself the chair of the institution in February and quickly thereafter fired and replaced its board and leadership.Zambello also cited the collapse in box office revenue and “shattered” donor confidence.Ticket sales were about40%unsold compared with before Trump declared himself chair, said Zambello. Many people have decided to boycott the center. Every day, she receives messages of protest from formerly loyal members of the audience, she says.“They say things like: ‘I’m never setting foot in there until the “orange menace” is gone.’ Or: ‘Don’t you know history? Don’t you know what Hitler did? I refuse to give you a penny,’” she said.“People send me back their the season brochure shredded in an envelope and say: ‘Never, never, will I return while he’s in power.’”Explore more on these topicsWashington DCOperaTrump administrationUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

His cellphone records also established that Gerlach was in the cemetery’s vicinity around the time of the thefts, police said.Yeadon police on Tuesday then spotted Gerlach leaving Mount Moriah with a crowbar and burlap sack, as the Inquirer reported. They arrested him near the Rav4, where in plain view “there were numerous bones and skulls in the back seat area”, said the probable cause affidavit that police filed after they took Gerlach into custody, according to the Pennsylvania news outletWHP-TV.Two children’s mummified remains, three skulls and several loose bones were inside the burlap sack, Yeadon police said. Gerlach allegedly told detectives he had used the crowbar that night to pry open a grave and steal the remains it contained. He was also accused of acknowledging that he had stolen at least 30 sets of human remains from the cemetery, including on previous occasions.Police searched Gerlach’s home about 70 miles (113km) away in Ephrata,Pennsylvania, the next day. They said they discovered human remains in the basement, on shelves, hanging from the ceiling and separately at a storage locker.“Detective walked into a horror movie come to life,” Rouse said. “This [was] an unbelievable scene.”Rouse said investigators also recovered jewelry from Gerlach’s home, and they were trying to determine whether it had been taken with the remains to be sold.As the Inquirer reported, Yeadon police chief Henry Giammarco remarked: “I can say this is probably the most horrific thing that I’ve seen” during his 30-year career in law enforcement.Investigators booked Gerlach with nearly 575 offenses, including more than 100 counts of corpse abuse. His other alleged crimes include theft, burglary, intentional desecration of venerated objects, trespassing, criminal mischief, receiving stolen property and desecrating historic lots and burial places.A judge ordered Gerlach held in lieu of $1m bail. He is tentatively scheduled to appear in court again on 20 January. No attorney for him was immediately listed.Rouse said he deeply empathized with those who were seeking to learn whether Gerlach’s alleged grave robbery spree had disturbed their relatives’ remains.“I grieve for those who are upset by this, who are going through it, who are trying to figure out if it is, in fact, their loved one or their child,” Rouse told reporters. “Because we found remains that we believe to be months-old infants – among those that he had collected.”Explore more on these topicsPennsylvaniaUS crimenewsShareReuse this content"

But a few wet years, and a recent spate of winter storms, helped bring the state out of drought.Amappublished by the US Drought Monitor on Thursday showed that no part of the state is experiencing drought or abnormal dryness. The development came after weeks of above-normal rainfall that helped fill reservoirs in the state, including lakes Shasta and Oroville, far beyond their historic averages. The December holiday seasonhas been one of the wetteston record for parts of southern California.Then and now: one year on from the Los Angeles wildfires – in picturesRead moreIn 2005 and 2011, the state saw periods with less than 1% of abnormal dryness, noted the NationalDroughtMitigation Center, the academic partner of the US Drought Monitor.This news marks the first time since the year 2000 that not a single square mile ofCaliforniais dry on the US Drought Monitor, Drew Tuma, an ABC7 meteorologist, said in a post on social media.“If you’re 25 or younger you’ve always lived in a world where California has been entering or recovering from drought,” Tuma wrote.Intense and deadly winter storms pummeled California in 2023, inundating the state with rain and hurricane-force winds that toppled trees and flooded rivers, left thousands without power, and led to more than 20 deaths. Months earlier, the state had been under significant water conservation rules. The barrage of storms that yearhelped ease the state’s drought, but didn’t eliminate it.Even into late December, there were still abnormally dry conditions in parts of the state – notably Modoc county in the north-east. That changed with heavy rains at the start of the year.But while California is out of drought, it’s not necessarily out of the woods yet. Recentsnowpack measurementsfrom the Phillips station in the Sierra Nevada found California’s snow levels currently stand around 70% of what is average for this time of year.The snowpack, which melts into rivers and streams in the spring, provides about a third of the water used in the state. Hydrologists say its too early to draw conclusions about the state’s water supply for the year ahead.“The trend we’re looking at right now is more rain than snow,” David Rizzardo, a hydrology section manager with the California department of water resources, told reporters last month. “We’d like to see the snow accumulation pick up by 1 April so that we’re closer to average.”The Associated Press contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsCaliforniaDroughtWaterWildfiresWest CoastnewsShareReuse this content"

This makes ocean heat one of the starkest indicators of the relentless march of the climate crisis, which will only end when emissions fall to zero. Almost every year since the start of the millennium has set a new ocean heat record.This extra heat makes thehurricanesand typhoons hitting coastal communities more intense, causes heavier downpours of rain andgreater flooding, and results inlonger marine heatwaves, whichdecimate lifein the seas. The rising heat is also a major driver of sea level rise via the thermal expansion of seawater, threatening billions of people.Reliable ocean temperature measurements stretch back to the mid-20th century, but it is likely the oceans are at their hottest for at least 1,000 years andheating faster than at any time in the past 2,000 years.The atmosphere is a smaller store of heat and more affected by natural climate variations such as the El Niño-La Niña cycle. The average surface air temperature in 2025 is expected to approximately tie with 2023 as the second-hottest year since records began in 1850, with 2024 being the hottest. Last year the planet moved into the cooler La Niña phase of the Pacific Ocean cycle.“Each year the planet is warming – setting a new record has become a broken record,” said Prof John Abraham at the University of St Thomas in Minnesota, US, and part of the team that produced the new data.“Global warming is ocean warming,” he said. “If you want to know how much the Earth has warmed or how fast we will warm into the future, the answer is in the oceans.”Theanalysis, published in the journal Advances in Atmospheric Sciences, used temperature data collected by a range of instruments across the oceans and collated by three independent teams. They used this data to determine the heat content of the top 2,000 metres of the oceans, where most of the heat is absorbed.The amount of heat taken up by the ocean is colossal, equivalent to more than 200 times the total amount of electricity used by humans across the world. “Ocean warming continues to exert profound impacts on the Earth system,” the scientists concluded.Ocean warming is not uniform, with some areas warming faster than others. In 2025, the hottest areas included the tropical and South Atlantic and North Pacific oceans, and the Southern Ocean. In the latter, which surrounds Antarctica, scientists are deeply concerned about acollapse in winter sea icein recent years.The North Atlantic and the Mediterranean Sea are also getting warmer, as well as saltier, more acidic and less oxygenated owing to the climate crisis. This is causing “a deep-reaching ocean state change in, making the ocean ecosystems and the life they support more fragile”, the researchers said.“As long as the Earth’s heat continues to increase, ocean heat content will continue to rise and records will continue to fall,” said Abraham. “The biggest climate uncertainty is what humans decide to do. Together, we can reduce emissions and help safeguard a future climate where humans can thrive.”Explore more on these topicsOceansClimate crisisPollutionMarine lifeSea iceExtreme weatherPolar regionsnewsShareReuse this content"

Global investment in low-carbon energy now outstrips that in fossil fuels by two to one. Taking overVenezuela’s basket-case oil industrywill make no perceptible difference.Simon Stiell, the UN’s climate chief, said US citizens and companies would bear the impact. “It is a colossal own goal which will leave the US less secure and less prosperous,” he said. “It will mean less affordable energy, food, transport and insurance for American households and businesses as renewables keep getting cheaper than fossil fuels, as climate-driven disasters hit American crops, businesses and infrastructure harder each year and as oil, coal and gas volatility drives more conflicts, regional instability and forced migration.”Trump’s actions were hardly unexpected: withdrawing from theParis agreement, to which the UNFCCC is the parent treaty, was one of his second-term priorities, begun on his first day. Withdrawing from the UNFCCC will mean the US no longer has a seat at the annual “conference of the party” (Cop) meetings, and withdrawing from the IPCC will mean the US no longer has a veto over the“summary for policymakers”that accompanies its seven-yearly reports.View image in fullscreenDonald Trump at an event during his campaign for the 2024 presidential election.Photograph: Alex Brandon/APSeen from other countries, the experience is a familiar one. For much of the last 30 years, the rest of the world has been forced to persevere with climate action in the face of US intransigence: the 1997 Kyoto protocol was prevented from coming into force until 2004 because the US Senate would not ratify it; under George W Bush, the US attended the annual Cops but often obstructed them; and in Trump’s first term, the withdrawal from the Paris agreement failed to provoke any others to follow suit.Mohamed Adow, the director of the thinktank Power Shift Africa, predicts countries will take a similar attitude this year, carrying on without the US. “The climate movement is bigger than any one nation,” he said. “African nations and the global south will continue pushing for climate justice, demanding that wealthy polluters honour their historical responsibilities, and building the clean energy future our people deserve.”While the political aspect of climate action struggles to gain top-level attention in a world beset by conflict, theeconomics of the low-carbon transitionhave taken on a life of their own. That may be where Trump’s actions look increasingly, in the words of the former secretary of state John Kerry, like a “self-inflicted wound”.Investment in low-carbon forms of energy is now above $2tn a year, dwarfing the $1tn spent on fossil fuels. Renewable energy alone grew 15% last year, accounting for more than 90% of all new power generation capacity. Electric vehicles now account for about a fifth of new cars sold around the world. Low-carbon power makes up more than half of the generation capacity of China and India, and China’s exports of low-carbon goods and services topped $20bn in a single month last year.View image in fullscreenSolar panels in Pingjing village in Anqing, China.Photograph: Costfoto/NurPhoto/Rex/ShutterstockChina is likely to remain committed to its increasingly vibrant low-carbon economy, according to Li Shuo, the director of the China Climate Hub at the Asia Society Policy Institute. “This commercial dynamism is happening increasingly between China and the global south,” he said. “These economic forces provide a more meaningful counter to Trump [than geopolitics].”Under Trump, the US risks being left on the sidelines – a position that Kerry called a “gift to China”. The economist Nicholas Stern said: “The economics of the [low-carbon] transition look ever more attractive. Every time we look at the science it looks more worrying, and every time we look at the technology it is more encouraging. In an increasingly insecure world, countries and industries will be seeking independence from fossil fuels and the great volatility such dependence brings. In a world with sluggish growth, countries and industries will be seeking new opportunities. These will be in the technologies of the 21st century, not the 19th and 20thcenturies.”But he noted that Trump, though he could not change the economic direction of travel, could unsettle some investors on the margins. “Any actions that slow down the pace are unhelpful,” he said.Whether Trump can unilaterally yank the US from a treaty that the Senate voted 92-0 to ratify in 1992 is a question that has legal scholars divided, although in practice America has walled itself off from the rest of the world regardless of regular processes.In his presidential memo, Trump said the exit meant “ceasing participation in or funding to those entities to the extent permitted by law”. At the annual UN climate summit in Brazil last year, there was for the first time no official US delegation – this will now become the norm.View image in fullscreenKeir Starmer, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva and Prince William at Cop30 in Brazil last year, where there was no US delegation.Photograph: Mauro Pimentel/ReutersSimilarly fraught legal questions linger over what might happen should a future president seek to reengage with the world on the climate crisis. If two-thirds of a bitterly divided Senate is required to rejoin the climate treaty, American absence could become permanent. Trump’s legacy will unspool long after he withdraws to Mar-a-Lago for more golf, both in terms of US participation in climate talks and the impact of the climate crisis itself on billions of people around the world.Meanwhile, people living in the US will be confronted with increasing frequency with the effects of the climate crisis. Wildfires last January in California forced the evacuation of more than 200,000 people.Farmers are strugglingwith pests, drought and floods. Homes in some areas arebecoming uninsurable, and extreme weather cost the USat least $115bnlast year.The effects will be felt even by the president. Jean-Pascal van Ypersele, a former vice-chair of the IPCC, said: “The Palm Beach area of Florida, where Trump’s Mar-a-Lago residence is located, is among the areas most vulnerable to sea level rise due to global warming. The US is not immune to this problem.”Explore more on these topicsClimate crisisTrump administrationDonald TrumpUnited NationsParis climate agreementUS politicsanalysisShareReuse this content"

One in six are recorded growing in only one or two locations.A spokesperson for the charity said: “Nurseries only stock a limited range and what’s in fashion changes, so keeping plants safe relies on people valuing what they have in their garden or public parks. We don’t treat plants as precious heritage in the same way we do objects.”Gardens were getting smaller and increasingly being paved over, they continued, and many people did not know how to propagate plants, which led them to buy easy-to-grow varieties from the nearest garden centre instead.A diversity of plants is important for garden wildlife, and many cultivated flowers are good for pollinators and provide shelter and food for wildlife, such as berries and seeds.The charity runs “national collections” of plants that safeguard certain species, and these are recognised internationally as “ex situ” (off-site) conservation. Some of the plants in collections are extinct in their home countries, such asBrugmansia(Angel trumpets), which are kept at Kew Gardens in London.The charity’s Chelsea garden will contain examples of the “living libraries” of plants already safeguarded within national plant collections, alongside those still in need of a “missing collector” to step forward. Collections to be featured will includeGeum,Boehmeria,PolypodiumandThalictrum, while the garden will also champion plants without a collection such asAquilegiaandVerbascum, to encourage future custodians.Gwen Hines, Plant Heritage’s chief executive, said: “We hope to inspire more people to join our growing community in safeguarding our nation’s favourite plants. Whilst plants in your garden may appear safer than those in the wild, they can still be at risk, so it’s crucial that we protect our garden plants.”View image in fullscreenThe easiest way to propagate most plants is through taking cuttings.Photograph: Viktor Pravdica/AlamyFive tips from Plant Heritage for successful propagationThe easiest way to propagate most plants is through taking cuttings.Success starts with healthy parent plantsTake cuttings from non-flowering stems of vigorous, pest-free plants. If it is a neglected plant, look for the youngest growth, ideally firm green stems, avoid those that have become woody.Think hygieneUse clean, sharp snips, scissors or secateurs to make a neat cut just above a leaf joint. This protects both the parent plant and the cutting.Pick the right plant partTrim the cutting to just below the lowest leaf join, removing the lower leaves. This is the joint node and the new roots will develop from here. For plants such as pelargoniums leave the cut to dry in the air for an hour or so, this allows callousing to begin which will protect the cut edge from rotting. For large leaved plants you can trim the leaves by 50% as well.Put your cutting to bedPot up your new cutting in a mix that will drain well, eg half peat-free growing media and half either horticultural grit, perlite, or coarse sand. If you are using rooting hormone, dip the cutting and then insert it into the compost firmly, using a pencil to make a hole. Firm and allow the pot to sit in a tray of water – this is better than watering from the top. Most cuttings can be kept on a windowsill but avoid harsh light and do not over water them.Share your plants and plant storiesLabel your cuttings with the plant’s name and where you got it and pass it on. Don’t forget to share its story, if you know it.Explore more on these topicsPlantsConservationGardening advicenewsShareReuse this content"

Comfort said they could not identify anything that was antisemitic or supportive of terrorism or violence.Abu-Sittah, who studied at the University of Glasgow and lives in London with his wife and three sons, had also reposted a tweet that said: “We congratulate our brothers in Hamas and our comrades in the Popular Front on the anniversary of their inception.”Hamas’s political wing became proscribed under the Terrorism Act in 2021. The tribunal said it did not have evidence as to when the tweets were posted other than that it was some time before 2023.The tribunal further found that the “ordinary reader” would see the tweet as a celebration of an anniversary and not as “material or moral aid” to terrorism.A second tweet by the medic spoke of “martyrs in the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine”, referring to a man who carried out the first operation using a suicide belt, in 1974, and a second man who died during fighting in 1973.Abu-Sittah said those with an understanding of the political context of the 1970s would see this post as only demonstrating “solidarity” with the Palestinian cause.Comfort said the tweet, read through the lens of an ordinary, reasonable Arabic reader, could not be seen as inciting or supporting violence or terrorism.The Kuwaiti-born medic said he had been racially profiled as “inherently violent” because he was a Palestinian and Arab, and accused the organisation UK Lawyers for Israel, which brought the matter to the attention of the GMC, of “trying to destroy my life”.After the hearing, he said: “My immediate thoughts are with my patients in Beirut, whom I was forced to leave in order to attend these proceedings. I have spent my entire medical career treating the victims of war and political violence. I was therefore deeply shocked to be accused of advocating violence. I do not, and have never, supported violence against civilians.“This complaint forms part of a broader lawfare strategy which aims to instrumentalise the regulatory processes to intimidate, silence and exhaust those who speak out against injustice in Palestine. This was the second complaint made against me to the GMC by UK Lawyers for Israel, and the 10th complaint made by them overall. The tribunal’s decision now stands in full view of the public.”A spokesperson for UK Lawyers for Israel said: “It is shocking that the tribunal has found it acceptable for doctors to commemorate acts of violence and pay tribute to terrorists. He has brought the profession into disrepute and Jewish patients are likely to be terrified of being treated by him.”Ros Emsley-Smith, representing the GMC, said Abu-Sittah had “overstepped the boundary of legitimate political speech and into the realms of misconduct”.The rector of Glasgow University is elected by students. Abu-Sittah is not a member of university staff and does not speak for the university.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

While the drugs slow the disease down, the benefits are minor, and theyhave been rejectedfor widespread use by the UK’s National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice).In searching for alternative therapies, scientists at UCL say drug developers should focus on two risk-raising variants of a gene named Apoe. Therapies designed to block the variants’ impact have “vast potential” for preventing the disease, they claim.Dr Dylan Williams, a genetic epidemiologist at UCL, said: “Most Alzheimer’s disease cases would not arise without the contribution of just this single gene: Apoe. We need to think about it as a direct target. Almost all potential Alzheimer’s cases could benefit from Apoe-related interventions.”More than half a million people in the UK, and more than 40 million worldwide, are living with Alzheimer’s disease, the most common form of dementia. Several genes contribute to Alzheimer’s risk and lifestyle is important too: smoking, obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure and cholesterol all make the disease more likely.Williams and his colleagues analysed medical records from more than 450,000 people of European ancestry to calculate how much Alzheimer’s disease arose due to different variants of the Apoe gene. People inherit two copies of the gene – one from each parent – and there are three main variants: Apoe2, 3 and 4.Scientists have long known that people with two copies of Apoe4 are high risk for Alzheimer’s, though 40% to 70% never develop the disease. The Apoe3 variant is widely considered neutral and the rare Apoe2 variant is regarded as protective.But Williams said we should see it another way. Compared with carrying two copies of Apoe2, both Apoe3 and Apoe4 raise the risk of Alzheimer’s, he said. Writing in the journalnpj Dementia, the team calculate that without these variants, 72% to 93% of Alzheimer’s cases, and about 45% of all dementia, would not have occurred. “If interventions could eliminate the detrimental effects [of Apoe3 and 4], we could expect to prevent most Alzheimer’s disease and a large proportion of all dementia,” they write.That is a big if. The Apoe gene is crucial for moving cholesterol and other fats around the body and brain, so knocking it out entirely is likely to cause problems. Future therapies might edit the gene variants, or dampen down their activity, but those are neither imminent nor risk-free.Another problem is that the vast majority of people – more than 99% in the study – carry Apoe3 or Apoe4. So preventing Alzheimer’s would mean treating nearly the entire population, possibly through invasive gene editing of the brain.The study received a mixed reception. Tim Frayling, professor of human genetics at the University of Geneva, said claiming more than 90% of Alzheimer’s would not occur without the Apoe gene’s effects was like saying more than 90% of road traffic deaths would not occur without the contribution of cars. “People should not worry if they have the risk versions of the gene, because 99.4% of us do,” he said.But Tara Spires-Jones, professor of neurodegeneration at the University of Edinburgh, said understanding the risk factors that made the brain vulnerable to Alzheimer’s was “essential for developing effective treatments and prevention strategies”, adding that Apoe was one of the most important genetic risk factors.Dr Sheona Scales, of Alzheimer’s Research UK, said: “Evidence around Apoe3 contributing to Alzheimer’s and dementia risk is significant, as this has been largely thought of as having a neutral effect on risk. However, it’s important to note that not everyone with these Apoe gene variations will go on to develop dementia, as other risk factors also have an influence.“This research raises lots of interesting questions, such as how Apoe3 and Apoe4 could drive Alzheimer’s risk, their effects in people of non-European ancestry, and whether targeting these variants could be a promising avenue for treatment and prevention of Alzheimer’s.“Because of the complexity of Alzheimer’s risk, Apoe testing is not available on the NHS for people worried about their risk of developing Alzheimer’s in the future. If you are worried about your dementia risk, you should speak to your GP.”Explore more on these topicsAlzheimer'sHealthDementiaMental healthnewsShareReuse this content"

The cases raised questions about weak lending standards, with Bailey saying there wereworrying echoesof the sub-prime mortgage crisis that kicked off the financial crisis.The Bank is about to launch a private credit industry stress test that will map out potential risks linked to the sector’s growth, including whether it could end up amplifying financial and economic shocksThe committee’s chair, Michael Forsyth, who served in John Major’s government, said: “The Bank of England, the Financial Conduct Authority and the Prudential Regulation Authority are right to be vigilant and to monitor the dramatic growth of private markets and the implications for financial stability.”A Treasury spokesperson said: “We have worked together with the regulators to significantly increase our focus on non-banks sectors in recent years and have a robust, flexible framework to protect financial stability.” They added that the Treasury would respond to the report in due course.Quick GuideContact Guardian Business about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact the Business team confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

He has not seen them in person since autumn of that year.Photograph: HandoutAbudagga told the Guardian that when he read the Home Office’s latest judgment, “I felt my final hope of being reunited with my wife and children after more than three years had been lost. It was very, very hard.”His wife’s response on hearing the news was desperate. “She kept saying to me when I called: ‘It seems we will never meet again. Don’t make any more efforts to bring us to the UK because it seems the UK will never get us there. Just keep concentrating on your studies,’” he said.The Home Office letter also said consideration had been given as to whether his wife and children’s circumstances “outweigh the interests of national and border security” and – by rejecting his request – implied they did not.Abudagga said: “When I read that they link bringing my family to the UK with UK security, and suggest the children are better off in Gaza, I simply could not believe in British values and norms any more. I expected the British government cared about family life, about human rights.”In his latest request for the government to help, Abudagga asked the Home Office specifically to give a decision in principle on his family’s visa applications before his wife had attended a VAC.Crucially, had he succeeded in this request, he could then have approached the Foreign Office for help with evacuating them to a country where Marim could have attended a VAC. But the request was turned down.View image in fullscreenThe children and their mother are now living in a camp near the sea in Gaza.Photograph: SuppliedThe Home Office’s UK decision-making team stated that it was “not satisfied that their circumstances are sufficiently compelling for [us] to be able to deviate from our normal policy that requires your clients to attend a VAC prior to consideration of their applications”.It also stated that because Abudagga had said he would want eventually to return to Gaza if and when he had a home for his family there, his stay in the UK was therefore considered temporary. “Consequently it is appropriate for your minor clients to remain with their primary carer, their mother, until circumstances change,” it said.In language that has appalled supporters of Abudagga’s case, the Home Office said in its response to his lawyers that it accepted “that circumstances in Gaza are difficult and that due to displacement it may be more difficult to access certain necessities. It is also acknowledged that you have informed us that your clients are displaced from their home due to evacuation orders.”.However, it was “not satisfied” that there was sufficient evidence to show their case was urgent or that the family reunion could not be delayed “until it is safe to visit a VAC”.Legal sources dealing in such cases say there has been a noticeable toughening of Home Office responses over recent months as the government attempts to clamp down on immigration and asylum in response to the rise of Reform UK. Many cases involve Palestinians trapped in Gaza.Abudagga says his wife and children are living in terrible conditions, short of food, suffering from the winter cold and under constant fear of bombardment despite the fragile ceasefire. The Guardian haspreviously reportedon the trauma suffered by Talya, Karim and their mother as a result of Israeli bombardments, moving homes and constant hunger.View image in fullscreenThe family are living in terrible conditions, Abudagga says.Photograph: SuppliedMarim is now mourning her father, who died two weeks ago. “My wife is trying to do the daily duties of bringing food, securing the tent from the weather – it is very cold, very windy, very rainy – when her father passed away two weeks ago. The details are very, very hard,” Abudagga said.In asimilar caserecently highlighted by the Guardian, another PhD student was evacuated with her family to the UK, having been allowed to do her biometrics in Jordan. This raised Abudagga’s hope that his case would be looked on favourably. “This lady was allowed to get her fingerprints done in Jordan and the Home Office later allowed her family to join. The case is the same as mine,” Abudagga said.The Home Office was approached for comment and was asked whether it realised that it was impossible for Marim to reach a VAC in Gaza because there was not one.Abudagga’s local MP, Rebecca Long-Bailey, has written to the home secretary, Shabana Mahmood, to ask the Home Office to reconsider his case but it has stuck by its decision.Abudagga has now instructed the human rights firm Leigh Day to represent him in challenging the Home Office’s refusal.Sarah Crowe, a human rights lawyer at Leigh Day, said: “We will be writing to the Home Office to set out why their decision-making in this case is plainly unlawful. In line with the Home Office’s own policy, Bassem’s family should have their applications predetermined, which is an important step in reuniting the family.”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

ICE, however, had disputed this, asserting she is a Mexican citizen who entered the US unlawfully.According to Díaz Morales, ICE agents detained her near her home on 14 December while her family watched. She told the DC, Maryland and Virginia news outletWRC-TVthat she attempted to explain she was born in Maryland – but said authorities did not accept her explanation. She added that her faith and the hope of reuniting with her family helped her endure the detention.Díaz Morales said she lived in Mexico starting at age seven and returned to the US more than a year and a half ago. She believes confusion arose because she used her mother’s last name while living in Mexico, whereas US records list both her father’s and mother’s last names.Renee Nicole Good said ‘I’m not mad at you’ before ICE agent shot her, video showsRead moreFour days after her arrest, a Maryland federal district court judge issued anorder preventingthe government from deporting her while the court reviewed a petition filed by her attorneys challenging her detention.One of her lawyers, Victoria Slatton, told theWashington Postthat the government has not dismissed the case against Díaz Morales, meaning deportation proceedings could still move forward despite her release. But Slatton said she remains confident that her client’s citizenship has been proven.“She is a US citizen,” Slatton told the Post. “She was born here. I think that we’ve presented more than enough evidence, but we will continue to fight it until every single court accepts and acknowledges it.”Her attorneys say that Díaz Morales entered the US to escape cartel violence in 2023 without proper paperwork and was mistakenly processed as an immigrant, placing her into deportation proceedings. They say that classification was an error.The legal team said they submitted her US birth certificate along with additional documents they say establish her citizenship – but those materials were still insufficient to secure her release from ICE custody.“In my years now of being an immigration attorney, I have never had to go this far for a case,” attorney Zachary Pérez, who also represents Díaz Morales, told WRC-TV. “What we were finally able to get and what we worked on getting was a lengthy affidavit from a medical professional, a doctor who described why the birth certificate was authentic.”A spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security told the Guardian in a statement: “Dulce Consuelo Madrigal Diaz is NOT a US citizen – she is an illegal alien from Mexico. She did NOT provide a valid US birth certificate or any evidence in support of her claim that she is a US citizen.“On December 14, ICE arrested this illegal alien in Baltimore,Maryland. On October 20, 2023, when CBP encountered her near Lukeville, Arizona, Madrigal-Diaz claimed she was a citizen of Mexico and was born on October 18, 2003,” the statement added.Díaz Morales told WRC-TV that she holds dual citizenship with Mexico and is in the process of applying for a US passport.

A 550lb black bear that took residence under a southern California home for more than a month has finally been removed,KTLAhas reported.Altadena resident Ken Johnson first noticed the bear was living in the crawl space below his home in late November.“He’s a nuisance and he’s living under my house rent-free,” Johnson told the Orange County Registerlast month.Johnson contacted California’s department of fish and wildlife (DFW) about the bear and the agencyattempted to trap itto no avail. Instead, they snagged a smaller bear, leaving the 550lb one to remain. After more than a month of the bear’s occupation, Johnsonthreatened to suethe DFW for negligence and emotional distress, according to KTLA.“If I kept track of everything I tried, it would be Bear: 14, Homeowner: 0,” Johnson told the news outlet.Johnson’s house wasn’t the first home the bear – who’d been tagged as number 2120 by the DFW – had sought refuge under. He had taken up residence in another home in the area before the officials moved him about 10 miles away.After the Eaton wildfire tore through the Angeles national forest and scorched parts of Altadena last January, wildlife – including several bears – sought shelter in the community. In the weeks after the fire, at least two 500lb-plus black bears sought refuge in homes evacuated during the wildfire, though it is unclear if 2120 was one of those bears.Black bears – the only species of bear living in California – are largely non-confrontational, having killed only one person in the state in recorded history. The population isestimated to be between 49,000 and 71,000, with 50% living in the north coast and Cascade regions, and 40% in the Sierra Nevada.On Tuesday, a Lake Tahoe-based non-profit called Bear League stepped in to help Johnson by shooting at the bear with paintball guns, which drove it from under the house.“I couldn’t believe it was so fast,” Johnson told KTLA. “These guys went in, they crawled in behind him and, boom, he was out.”The bear tried to come back two days later but was met with a deterrent – an electrified mat that covered the crawl space’s entrance, according to KTLA. Johnson added that since the bear’s removal, he’s been able to assess the damage it left, which includes a ruptured gas line.Explore more on these topicsCaliforniaAnimalsLos AngelesWildfiresWest CoastnewsShareReuse this content"

Moscow said the launch of the intermediate-range ballistic missile was retaliation for a supposed attempted Ukrainian drone attack on Vladimir Putin’s residence late last month – an allegation Kyiv and Washington have said is false.Ukraine’s foreign minister said the use of an Oreshnik missile so close to the EU and Nato border posed a “grave threat” to European security and called on partners to increase pressure on Moscow. Kyiv also dismissed Russia’s attempts to justify the strike, calling them “absurd”.Ukraine’s security service releasedphotosit said showed fragments of an Oreshnik missile recovered in Ukraine’s western Lviv region.View image in fullscreenA photo released by the Ukrainian security service on Friday reportedly showing a fragment of a Russian Oreshnik ballistic missile at an undisclosed location in western Ukraine.Photograph: Ukrainian security service/AFP/Getty ImagesThe governor of Lviv said Russian strikes had damaged a critical infrastructure facility. Unverified social media reports suggested the site may have been a large underground gas storage facility.Pro-Russian military bloggers circulatedfootagethey said captured the Oreshnik strike. The video, filmed over a snow-covered area, appears to show several bright flashes hitting the ground before a loud explosion and a sequence of secondary blasts.Russia first used Oreshnik, which is capable of carrying nuclear warheads and is named after the Russian word for hazel tree, in November 2024, when Moscow said it struck a Ukrainian military-industrial facility. Ukrainian officials and analysts at the time said the missile carried dummy warheads rather than explosives and caused limited damage.Initial reports suggest the Oreshnik used in Friday’s strike again carried inert warheads, indicating the launch was largely symbolic. The strike came days afterUkraine’s European allies agreedto provide key elements of postwar security guarantees in the event of a ceasefire with Russia.View image in fullscreenA man stands near a damaged block of flats after a Russian attack in Kyiv early on Friday morning.Photograph: Tetiana Dzhafarova/AFP/Getty ImagesPutin has invoked the Oreshnik repeatedly in recent months as a threat against Ukraine and the west, warning it could be used against countries that supply weapons for Kyiv to strike targets inside Russia with longer-range missiles.Kaja Kallas, the EU’s foreign policy chief, said Russia’s reported use of an Oreshnik missile was a clear escalation against Ukraine and was meant as a warning to Europe and the US.“EU countries must dig deeper into their air defence stocks and deliver now. We must also further raise the cost of this war for Moscow, including through tougher sanctions,” Kallas added.The Russian leader has claimed the intermediate-range missile is impossible to intercept because of its speed – which he says exceeds 10 times the speed of sound – and that its destructive power rivals that of a nuclear weapon even when armed with a conventional warhead.Some western analysts have expressed scepticism about those claims, though Ukraine has no air defence systems capable of intercepting the missile.Russian forces also carried out overnight strikes on Kyiv, hitting several districts of the Ukrainian capital. At least one person was killed, according to Tymur Tkachenko, the head of the Kyiv city military administration. Five rescue workers were injured while responding to the attacks, Ukraine’s security service said.The Kyiv mayor, Vitali Klitschko, said half of the capital’s apartment blocks were without heating after the Russian strikes and urged residents who had places to stay outside the city to do so. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said a building of the Qatar embassy was damaged in the strikes.View image in fullscreenBroken glass at the Qatar embassy in Kyiv after a Russian drone and missile strike.Photograph: Taras Garanich/ReutersThe Oreshnik launch capped a week in which Ukraine and its European allies said they had made significant progress on plans for postwar security guarantees.On Tuesday, Britain and Francesaid they were prepared to deploy troopsto Ukraine after a future peace agreement – a significant commitment under discussion for months.Russia’s foreign ministry rejected the idea on Thursday, calling the prospect of western troops in Ukraine a “direct threat”, a position that again casts doubt on the prospects for a negotiated peace.Explore more on these topicsRussiaUkraineEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Italy’s Giorgia Meloni, long seen as a key vote, backed it, allowing the landmark deal to be adopted under qualified majority voting rules.The European parliament must approve the deal to bring it into force, but as trade falls within the exclusive competence of the European Commission, its head, Ursula von der Leyen, is expected to travel toParaguayon Monday to formally sign the agreement.Von der Leyen said the EU had listened to farmers, describing the deal as a “win-win agreement” yielding a €50bn opportunity to EU exporters by 2040 and €9bn growth to Mercosur countries. She also vowed to step up import controls to ensure EU standards on meat and other farm produce imports were upheld.Supporters of the deal say it will help deepen the EU’s economic cooperation with the global south, where China is already seeking alliances in the wake of the disruption Donald Trump has caused to the international trade order.It will also help the EU wean itself off China for critical minerals and rare earths vital for the auto and tech sectors as these elements are abundant in the Mercosur countries.Brazil accounts for about 20% of the world’s reserves of graphite, nickel, manganese and rare earths. But it also holds 94% of global reserves of niobium, a metal used in the aerospace industry, while Argentina is the third largest producer of lithium, a material used in batteries in electric vehicles.“The deal is not only about economics. Latin America is a region of intense competition for influence between western countries and China. Failing to sign the EU-Mercosur free trade agreement risked pushing Latin American economies closer to Beijing’s orbit.“The conclusion of the deal also signals that Europeans are serious about diversifying their export markets away from the US,” said Agathe Demarais, senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations, a leading thinktank.Farmers in beef, poultry and grain sectors claim they arecollateral damage.“This will kill our agriculture in Poland,” Janusz Sampolski, a Polish farmer, told Agence France-Presse. “We will be dependent on supply chains from other countries,” he said, adding that it could threaten Poland’s food security “in the event of the threat of war”.The Climate Action Network said the deal was not only about tariffs and quotas but would “drive deforestation” and “worsen human rights conditions in some of the world’s most sensitive ecosystems” with incentives to farm more beef and soy and timber for paper in deforestation-prone areas.Explore more on these topicsEuropean UnionEuropeFrancePolandBelgiumArgentinaBrazilnewsShareReuse this content"

Ismail’s salary is also believed to have been increased by 30%, rising by about £70,000 to £300,000.The commission said its inquiry will examine a range of issues including “concerns raised in public reporting relating to the sale and bonuses awarded to its executives”.It will also review “information provided by the charity to the commission regarding the sale of the awarding, assessment, and training businesses of the charity”, as well as “the trustees’ decision-making regarding the sale” plus “information that they were provided with and considered when making this decision”.In its statement the commission said it “may extend the scope of the inquiry if additional regulatory issues emerge”, adding that it had previously been “made aware of the proposed sale by the charity, and had sought and received assurances about the trustees’ decision-making, but the sale did not require the commission’s regulatory consent”.Founded in 1878 by the City of London and a group of 16 livery companies, the original institute developed a national system of technical education, offeringqualifications and apprenticeshipsin fields ranging from manufacturing and mechanical engineering to hairdressing and horticulture. It was awarded a royal charter by Queen Victoria in 1900, and the body says it helps about 1.1 million people a year.It has enjoyed a storied history, and the body’s famous alumni include the chefsJamie Oliver, Marcus Wareing and Gordon Ramsay, as well as the former England football manager Gareth Southgate, the celebrity gardenerAlan Titchmarsh and the fashion designer Karen Millen.The institute’s business was owned under the umbrella of a charity, City & Guilds London Institute (CGLI), which announced in the autumn that it was selling its training and awards operation, City & Guilds (C&G),to PeopleCert.The charity, whichprovides grants to people in need of vocational training, said the sale gave it a cash windfall of between £180m and £200m, which was presented as ensuring the long-term future of the institution to pursue its charitable objectives, as well as providing increased opportunities and investment for the now-private training business.The trustees of the charity, CGLI, said:“We acknowledge the Charity Commission’s statutory inquiry and are cooperating fully with their investigation. We remain confident that all actions taken by the trustees have been proper, transparent, and in line with our charitable purpose. We are committed to maintaining public trust and will continue to act in the best interests of the charity and its beneficiaries.”The private business arm, City & Guilds Ltd, has previously said: “Any awards to employees are a matter for City & Guilds Ltd and are guided by standard commercial practice to ensure critical expertise and experience is retained.”Explore more on these topicsBusinessVocational educationnewsShareReuse this content"

If a deal is agreed, it would create a global mining business with an enterprise value of more than $260bn (£193bn).The two companies said on Friday that they were in “preliminary discussions” about a “possible combination of some or all of their businesses, which could include an all-share merger”.Rio Tinto, which has an enterprise value of $162bn, said the deal under discussion would potentially result in it acquiringGlencore.Rio Tinto, founded in 1873, has about 60,000 employees across 35 countries, while Glencore – which was established in the 1970s as a trading company – has operations in more than 30 countries and a workforce of about 150,000 through employees and contractors.“The parties’ current expectation is that any merger transaction would be effected through the acquisition of Glencore by Rio Tinto by way of a court-sanctioned scheme of arrangement,” the company said in a statement. “There can be no certainty that an offer will be made or as to the terms of any such offer, should one be made.”The resumption of the talks follows the$53bn mergerof the London-listed miner Anglo American with its Canadian rival Teck in September, combining two of the world’s largest copper producers.Anglo had previously rebuffed a £39bn takeover proposal from BHP Group, while Teck rejected a buyout offer from Glencore in 2023 for £16.6bn.Copper prices hit an all-time high of more than $13,300 a tonne this week, as analysts predicted there could be a supply shortfall of as much as 10m tonnes by 2040.“Last year’s theme of consolidation in the natural resources sector has shown no sign of let-up in the early part of 2026,” said Derren Nathan, the head of equity research at Hargreaves Lansdown.“A full combination would create a global leader in multiple industrial metals including iron ore and transition metals such as copper, cobalt and lithium.” The resources are critical in theproduction of technology products, including smartphones, at the centre of the boom in AI.In December, Gary Nagle, Glencore’s chief executive, said the company’s aim was to become “the biggest copper producer in the world”. It is the world’s sixth-largest copper producer and the largest listed coal producer.Rio Tinto and Glencore held talks over a tie-up in 2024 but they failed on issues including valuation, who would run the combined company and the future of Glencore’s coalmining operations.In May, Glencore confirmed a restructure of its business to move its coal operations into a separate Australian-based entity. Rio Tinto sold its last coalmine in 2018.However, Rio is said to be open to the possibility of retaining Glencore’s coal business, according to a report by Bloomberg.Rio’s potential return to coal would follow asignificant changein the political climate towards fossil fuels.Donald Trump has led a backlash against green policies – earlier this week he pulled the US out of akey United Nations climate treaty– while large oil and gas companies have beenscrapping renewable energy targets and upping production of fossil fuels.Since the previous talks between the two companies ended, Rio has appointed a new chief executive, Simon Trott, who took over in August.“The diverse asset base and likely synergies have the potential to provide further protection against commodity price fluctuations,” said Nathan. “But just how Glencore’s coal and trading arms fit in with Rio’s business model, and push for improved sustainability credentials, are key questions to answer.”Under UK takeover rules, Rio Tinto has until 5 February to either make a formal offer for Glencore or confirm it is not proceeding with a deal.Rio is listed on the FTSE 100 and on the Australian stock exchange. Its shares fell 6% in Australia on Friday. Rio’s London listed shares closed 3% down, while Glencore’s rose by nearly 10%.Nagle, the former head of Glencore’s coal assets, took over from thelongtime boss Ivan Glasenberg in 2020. Glasenberg, who ran Glencore for 18 years, was one of ahandful of top executives to become billionairesat the company’s colossal flotation in 2011.The flotation revealed that Glasenberg had apaper fortune of almost £6bn, a figure so large thathis 3,600 neighboursin the Swiss village of Rüschlikon received a tax cut.Glasenberg’s close lieutenants, Daniel Maté, Telis Mistakidis, Tor Peterson and Alex Beard, all owned stakes worth about £2bn at that time.Glencore wasfounded in 1974by the metals trader Marc Rich but, in 1983, he was indicted on charges described by the then US attorney for New York, Rudy Giuliani, as“the biggest tax evasion case in United States history”.In December, Glencore’s Nagle said that the mining industry needed to further consolidate “not just for the sake of size, but also to create material synergies, to create relevance, to attract talent, to attract capital”.In 2007, Rio Tinto bought Canada’s Alcan to create the biggest producer of aluminium in the world, a move to diversify beyond its core iron ore and copper businesses.In the same year, Freeport-McMoRan completed its acquisition of Phelps Dodge Corp to form the world’s largest publicly traded copper company.Five years later, Glencore agreed an all-share takeover of the Switzerland-headquartered Xstrata, beating a hostile bid from Aloca, creating a commodities conglomerate spanning mining, agriculture, oil and trading.In 2023, Newmont, the world’s largest goldminer, acquired Australia’s biggest gold producer, NewcrestMining.Explore more on these topicsMiningMergers and acquisitionsRio TintoGlencorenewsShareReuse this content"

Today, however, few are keen to face another period of uncertainty and potential unwinding of post-Brexit changes.UK regulators have been under pressure to dismantle a series of EU-era rules that politicians argue have hampered competitiveness and growth. Subsequent changes have led to larger banker bonuses, lower capital levels and looser listing rules for companies seeking to float in London.Reversing those changes would risk derailing the recovery in London’s stock market listings, according to Steve Fine, the chief executive of Peel Hunt investment bank.“A huge amount of work and effort has gone into improving the landscape for financial services in the UK, which are essential for a viable domestic capital market,” he said.“The UK now has materially less friction than most other European jurisdictions as a venue for listing. If we want IPOs to come back, if we want the City to thrive, if we want public markets to be a key part of the overall financial markets landscape – this is all been really important. So ripping it up and going back to where we were simply wouldn’t make any sense. We do not want to be choking that off through excessive regulation.”Miles Celic, the chief executive of the lobby group TheCityUK, which represents the wider financial and professional services industry, acknowledged that closer cooperation with the UK’s second-largest market for financial services made sense.“But rejoining the single market or a customs union would not be a simple upgrade,” he said. “As a non-member, the UK would risk trading flexibility for uniformity: less scope to shape its own rules and fewer chances to cut bespoke deals beyond Europe, in return for the benefits of a single EU framework. As always, there’s a trade-off.”A government spokesperson saidtalks with Brussels at a crunch summitin spring 2025, had identified “several potential areas for strengthened cooperation. Financial services did not form part of this agreement. However, the EU is the UK’s second-largest trading partner for financial services, and we continue to explore areas of cooperation where it is in our economy’s interest.”Explore more on these topicsFinancial sectorBrexitEuropean UnionEuropeForeign policynewsShareReuse this content"

The sprawling event aims to showcase cutting-edge technology developed by startups and big brands.Many of these fancy developments will be available to actually buy, moving from outlandish concepts to production devices, although some are still limited to costly prototypes.Humanoid robots march ever closer to realityView image in fullscreenThe LG CLOiD robot folds laundry at the LG Electronics booth at CES 2026.Photograph: Abbie Parr/APThe rise of the humanoid robot continues, with the show floor filled with myriad prototypes, some of which operated autonomously rather than being remotely controlled or performing set routines this year.Not one but two different robots promised to do your laundry, make breakfast and serve drinks. In demos LG’sCLOiD home robot, which is reportedly due to undergo real-world testing next year, looked like a disembodied torso on a rolling platform, slowly and autonomously doing chores linked with various LG kitchen appliances.The Chinese company Switchbot’s Onero H1, however, looksmore like a security bot crossed with a robot vacuumwith articulating arms ready to do chores. The company says it should go on sale later this year for an undisclosed sum. It joined impressive demos from many other Chinese robotics outfits, including Unitree, Booster Robotics and X-Humanoid, the recent winner ofBeijing’s humanoid robot half-marathon.View image in fullscreenProduct-ready Boston Dynamics Atlas robots were on show at the Hyundai Motor Group booth during CES 2026.Photograph: Steve Marcus/ReutersThis also promises to be that year that Boston Dynamics’ long-tested Atlas robot finally goes from awkward prototype to polished product, with a new design unveiled during theparent company Hyundai’s CES show.The South Korean firm is partnering with Google’s DeepMind for robotic AI research and plans to deploy the Atlas robots, which are water resistant, can lift 50kg and automatically swap their batteries, to its manufacturing plants in the next couple of years.Robot vacuums that can finally climb stairsView image in fullscreenThe Cyber X robot was on display tackling stairs at the Dreame booth during CES 2026.Photograph: Caroline Brehman/AFP/Getty ImagesRobot vacuums are the more prevalent home robot for now, but even they have new tricks. Dreame’s Cyber10 Ultra arm-equipped robovac canlift up to 500gand use brushes and other nozzles while cleaning your floors. It will reportedly go on sale around August for about €1,800 (£1,560), although it was the company’s Cyber X concept with four legs and tank-like tracks that had attenders captivated because it might help it finally vanquish the mortal enemy of robot vacuums: climbing stairs.View image in fullscreenRoborock Savos Rover has a pair of legs with wheels to manage stairs.Photograph: RoborockHowever, if actually cleaning the stairs is the goal, Roborock’s first two-wheel-leg robovac might be better. TheSaros Rover is in development, shown off in prototype form, and can raise, lower and jump its way to each step, cleaning as it goes.Voice-controlled fridgesNot even the humble fridge was safe this year from the march of robotics. Samsung debutedits new Family Hub fridge, which includes a screen on the front but its party piece is voice-controlled doors you can open and close hands-free.Less novel but potentially just as useful, GE built a barcode scanner intoits new Profile fridge, which is designed to scan things as you discard them to automatically add them to a shopping list ready for when you need it. A camera inside the fridge lets you check remotely to see if anything’s finished or rotten.Unrolling and motorised laptopsView image in fullscreenThe Thinkbook Plus Gen 7 has a motorised hinge that twists to face you.Photograph: LenovoScores of new laptops were on show from all the major manufacturers including Acer, Dell, Samsung and others. But Lenovo’sLegion Pro Rollable conceptwas the start of the show: a regular-looking 16in laptop with a OLED screen that unrolls horizontally to a full-size 24in monitor for gaming and productivity on the go. Meanwhile, the company’s newThinkPad Plus Gen 7 Auto Twistis going from concept to actual product with a motorised rotating hinge that automatically turns the screen to face you or your audience if you are presenting.Folding phones and the return of the BlackberryView image in fullscreenThe Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold was shown off CES 2026 ahead of its international launch.Photograph: Patrick T Fallon/AFP/Getty ImagesSamsung used CES to show off its cutting-edge trifolding flexible screen Android phone-tablet hybrid, which takes the book-style folding design and adds another section that unfolds again like a pamphlet to reveal a large wide-screen tablet. Having gone on sale in South Korea just before the end of 2025 theGalaxy Z TriFoldis expected to reach the US and other markets in the first half of this year for a big sum.But for those who long for thedays of physical keyboards on phones, the accessory company Clicks is bringing back the BlackBerry withits new Communicator: an Android phone with a physical keyboard. Designed as a “communication companion” with custom software that puts messaging above doomscrolling on social media, the Communicator can be used as a primary phone or as a partner to your existing iPhone or Android. It has a notification LED around the power button and a fingerprint scanner in the space bar. Reservations are open and the phone is due to ship later this year.View image in fullscreenThe Clicks Communicator and Power Keyboard channel the spirit of the BlackBerry.Composite: ClicksClicks already sells keyboard cases for the iPhone, Pixel and other devices for those that don’t want to replace their phone completely with a BlackBerry. But it also had a new slide-out keyboard Bluetooth that doubles as a magnetic wireless charging battery pack on show at CES.

But between the usual stable of celebrity retrospectives, music documentaries and the ongoing work to record the atrocities in Gaza, the documentary slate for 2026 already seems both full and promising. From the assassination attempt on Salman Rushdie to AI, a Billie Jean King retrospective toElon Musk, here are 10 of the most hotly anticipated documentaries in 2026.Knife: The Attempted Murder of Salman RushdieIn recent years, the Sundance film festival has become the premier destination for buzzy and/or prestige documentaries – three of the last five Oscar wins have gone to films that premiered in Utah, and the festival is now routinely alight with major celebrity retrospectives. Potentially combining both at the festival this year is Knife: The Attempted Murder of Salman Rushdie, film-maker Alex Gibney’s nonfiction adaptation of the writer’s bestselling memoir, which detailed the 2022 onstage assassination attempt that cost him his vision in one eye. The film reportedly combines never-before-seen footage of the Indian-born, British-raised writer’s recovery, filmed by his wife (of 11 months, at the time)Rachel Eliza Griffiths, as well as interviews and excerpts from his work, including the fatwa for his death issued by Iran’s Ayatollah Khomeini in 1989.Alex Gibney’s MuskSpeaking of Gibney, we’re still waiting for the prolific documentarian’s take onElon Musk, which has been in production on and off for years. (Presumably the first half of last year, when the tech billionaire-turned-unelected White House CEO torched the federal government via his meme-coined “Department of Government Efficiency”, was an on period.) Gibney, who has directed critical evaluations of the Church of Scientology, Elizabeth Holmes and Enron, among others, is no stranger to shifty, complex characters; his Musk film promises to provide a “definitive and unvarnished examination” of the erratic entrepreneur, with participation of those formerly in his orbit (though, somewhat contentiously, not Musk himself). The last public update on the project was in August 2025, when Bleecker Street acquired the rights for a theatrical release in the US at a still-unannounced date.The History of ConcreteView image in fullscreenA still from The History of Concrete.Photograph: John WilsonAny fan of HBO’sHow To With John Wilson– which is, for my money, the single best TV show made about New York this decade – will know that the following sentence is a perfect logline: “After attending a workshop on how to write and sell a Hallmark movie, film-maker John Wilson tries to use the same formula to sell a documentary about concrete.” The droll documentarian’s idiosyncratic style, sly observational humor and frankly genius eye for the gritty magic in urban life have made meditations on scaffolding, waste collection and wine stores into must-see television; his feature-length documentary debut on the history of concrete is thus one of the must-see premieres at Sundance later this month.OzThe Wicked press tour may finally be winding down, but there’s still no escaping Oz in 2026. After the runaway success of the two-part film adaptation of the Broadway musical, a new documentary will go behind the scenes of the movie that inspired it all. Oz, produced by Leonardo DiCaprio and Danny Strong, among others, will revisit the production of the 1939 classic, which, according to the film’s logline, “tested the limits of its creators”, including director Victor Fleming and star Judy Garland. Though Oz will, of course, feature plenty of archival footage from the groundbreaking production process, this will be no plain history doc; re-enactment filming (of whom? For what?) reportedly took place last year, just after a new digitized version of the original played at the Sphere in Las Vegas.Billie Eilish: Hit Me Hard and Soft: The Tour (Live in 3D)Coming in hot for the “most unlikely duo” award isJames Cameron, master of the cinematic epic, and gen Z icon Billie Eilish. Why did the famed director take a break from the slow-rolling world of Avatar to film the singer’s Hit Me Hard and Soft concert tour? The answer, it seems, was the chance to use fancy cameras – “no one’s shot a concert film on this scale before … We’re using tech that’s never been used before”, says Cameron in the recently released trailer for the 3D theatrical event billed as “an innovative new concert experience” starting 20 March. Jury is still out on how “innovative” the 3D feels … but based on the trailer, I will happily watch many minutes of Cameron and Eilish, two massive stars of very different solar systems, attempt to work together.The AI DocDaniel Roher, director of the Oscar-winning film Navalny, on the late Russian opposition leader, puts himself at the center of his next film, which enters the vast cinematic minefield known as artificial intelligence. Conveniently called The AI Doc (subtitle: Or How I Became an Apocaloptimist), the film, which premieres at Sundance with a theatrical release to follow in March, assumes Roher’s perspective as he explores “the existential dangers and stunning promise of this technology that humanity has created” while on the cusp of becoming a father. Co-directed by Charlie Tyrell and produced by Everything Everywhere All At Once co-director Daniel Kwan, The AI Doc will attempt to thread a fine needle, spending time with experts on both sides of the doom/promise spectrum.Once Upon a Time in HarlemView image in fullscreenA still from Once Upon a Time in Harlem.Photograph: William Greaves ProductionsOne evening in 1972, the genre-defying film-maker William Greaves convened a dinner party at Duke Ellington’s New York townhouse. The guests were the remaining luminaries of the Harlem Renaissance: influential Black artists, musicians, librarians, poets, actors, teachers and critics whose work shaped the jazz age; the occasion was posterity, as Greaves recorded more than three hours of conviviality and conversation among old friends, many of whom had not seen each other in 50 years. The cinema verité footage, newly restored and arranged by Greaves’s son David, who was a camera operator that day, promises a fly-on-the-wall portal into one of the 20th century’s most significant and vital cultural movements.Give Me the Ball!Few female athletes have been as trailblazing or as influential asBillie Jean King. Give Me the Ball!, which will premiere at Sundance, finally gives the tennis legend and queer icon her flowers, through archival materials and exclusive interviews. Directed by Liz Garbus and Elizabeth Wolff, the retrospective will delve into King’s battles on the court, including her infamous Battle of the Sexes with Bobby Riggs, and off it, as she fought for women’s equity in sports, as well as women’s and LGBTQ+ rights at large.Questlove’s Earth, Wind & FireView image in fullscreenMaurice White from Earth, Wind & Fire in Hamburg, Germany, in 1979.Photograph: Fotex/Rex/ShutterstockIn the past few years, the Roots member Amir “Questlove” Thompson has established himself as a vital, virtuoso director of music documentaries and a custodian of Black cultural history. His mesmeric debut filmThe Summer of Soul, whichvibrantly retoldthe story of the 1969 Harlem cultural festival (AKA the Black Woodstock), won the Oscar in 2022; last year’sSly Lives! AKA The Burden of Black Genius, brilliantly examined both the life of the trailblazing musician Sly Stone and the specific difficulties faced by Black artists. He returns this year with a still-untitled film on Earth, Wind & Fire, the genre-bending Chicago group founded in 1969 by Maurice White. Questlove reportedly gained access to the band’s video and recording archive, and has made the celebratory doc, which will premiere on HBO later this year, with the support of the band and White’s estate.Narnia! Dune! Charli xcx! The 2026 films Guardian writers are most excited aboutRead moreAmerican DoctorThe past year has seen a plethora ofexcellent nonfiction filmson Gaza and the larger fight for Palestinian freedom – among them, Oscar winnerNo Other Land,The Encampments,Coexistence, My Ass!andPut Your Soul on Your Hand and Walk. American Doctor, which documents three American physicians – Palestinian, Jewish and Zoroastrian – called to Gaza by a moral obligation to help those suffering, promises to be a similarly gut-wrenching watch. Following the doctors’ triage units in the wake of devastating attacks, the film offers a necessary reminder of the US’s role in the decimation of Gaza – and, according to the official description, a “path forward to engage on such a difficult issue with humanity and collective action”.Explore more on these topics2026 culture previewDocumentary filmsSalman RushdieElon MuskAlex GibneyBillie Jean KingBillie EilishfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The longlists, which are an intermediate stage on the way to the final nominations with each category determined by different mixes of membership voting and jury selection, suggest that some progress is being made.In the directors list, which Bafta mandated must include 50% women, the longlist has found room for Chloé Zhao(Hamnet), Katherine Bigelow (A House of Dynamite), Lynne Ramsay (Die My Love), Hikari (Rental Family) and Kaouther Ben Hania (The Voice of Hind Rajab). Including Ryan Coogler (Sinners), the list contains four people of colour; Bafta however, does not appear to have targets for this. Juke-joint horror Sinners has performed strongly overall, in joint second place having secured 14 longlist entries.The acting longlists appear, however, to be performing less well in terms of diversity, with seven people of colour out of 40 longlistees included. Places have been found for Cynthia Erivo (Wicked: For Good), who was excluded fromthe Actors (formerly Screen Actors Guild) awards nominees, alongside Chase Infiniti (One Battle After Another) and Tessa Thompson (Hedda) in the best actress list, while Sinners’ Michael B Jordan, Wunmi Mosaku and Delroy Lindo, and Teyana Taylor (One Battle After Another) are included elsewhere.In 2025 Bafta said it had achieved its five-year targetof 20% of members from minority ethnic groups, 12% deaf, disabled and neurodivergent people and 10% LGB+. However it had not achieved its target of 50% female membership, saying 43% identified as women.In total longlist entries for the 2026 awards, Paul Thomas Anderson’s One Battle After Another is currently best placed; starring Leonardo DiCaprio in a loose adaptation of Thomas Pynchon’s novel Vineland; it appears 16 times, in contention for awards including best picture, best director for Anderson, and best actor and actress for DiCaprio and Infiniti.Also well represented on the longlist are Shakespearean grief drama Hamnet andSinners, which have each secured 14 entries. Hamnet, directed by Zhao and starring Paul Mescal and Jessie Buckley, is included on the list for best picture, outstanding British film, best director for Zhao and best actor and actress for Mescal and Buckley. Sinners, likewise, is on the list for best picture, best director for Coogler, and best actor for Michael B Jordan.Other strong performers include Marty Supreme (13 entries, including Timothée Chalamet for best actor), and Bugonia and Frankenstein on 12 each. The longlist would appear to confirm Wicked: For Good’s faltering awards season momentum; despite its commercial success, the film is well down the field with only eight, though these do include Erivo and Ariana Grande for best actress and supporting actress respectively.The final nominations are announced on 27 January, and the award winners will be announced on 22 February ata ceremony at London’s Royal Festival Hall hosted by actor Alan Cumming.Explore more on these topicsFilmBaftasRaceSinnersWomenAwards and prizesnewsShareReuse this content"

In the last few weeks we’ve had three almost completely pointless short trailers online, with another reportedly playing in cinemas ahead of Avatar: Fire and Ash. First there wasCaptain America cradling his baby, thenThor praying to his dear old dead omnipotent dad. This week we got ourfirst proper look at the classic X-Men lineup in the new film, and there are suggestions that an encounter between the Fantastic Four’s The Thing and half of Wakanda is imminent.Something weird is clearly happening. These aren’t teaser trailers in any meaningful sense, because these half-cocked, chord-drenched promotional entries tell us absolutely nothing about what is to come. Assembled fandom wants to know who Doctor Doom is in the new movie, and why he looks exactly like Robert Downey Jr’s Iron Man (because if this is just stunt-casting there are going to be walkouts). We want to know how all the Fantastic Four and X-Men have suddenly turned up in the main Marvel timeline, when the last 17 years of these movies made no mention of them whatsoever. And we’d really like it not to just be explained away by … “the multiverse”.But instead of telling us this, the Doomsday marketing team are giving us strange little promo reels designed – it appears – to function as proof that theMarvelblockbuster machinery still works. These are marginally better than that awful film about chairs that revealed who would be cast in the movie, but not by much.What we do know is that Chris Evans’ Cap is back, but he comes with a whole lot of additional parental baggage. We are also aware that Chris Hemsworth’s Thor is somehow still struggling to live up to Odin’s expectations, even though Anthony Hopkins’ Allfather died three movies ago. As of this week’s online mini-trailer, it looks as though the X-Men have been through some sort of horrific apocalyptic experience in which half of them were knocked off by Sentinels (again). Meanwhile there is absolutely nothing new in the revelation that Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart remain the most marketable versions of Magneto and Professor X, despite having a combined age of 171. In the new X-Men promo, there’s no sense of mission or objective, just the darkling implication that something very bad has already happened. Like the other trailers, it isn’t an introduction so much as a headcount: the cinematic equivalent of checking who is still alive after a disaster. Reports suggest the next of these promo fragments will involve Ebon Moss-Bachrach’s The Thing meeting the Wakandans.Avengers: Doomsday trailer – as the hype builds, has Marvel got lost in the multiverse?Read moreThere is little point in actively searching for new promos online, though. Do that and you’ll be rewarded with a slurry of AI-generated “fan trailers”. It’s as if curiosity itself is being punished. The reality is that engaging with these early glimpses of Doomsday – our first sustained contact with the film beyondthat moment in Fantastic Four when the supervillain briefly babysits Franklin Richards– has been like watching a stage magician whose routine consists of shuffling the cards, adjusting the lights and chatting to the crowd, all while very pointedly not doing the trick.Doom will presumably be the apex figure who ties it all together, explains the arrival of all these mutant interlopers from other universes and finally turns this elaborate exercise in brand reassurance into something resembling a story. If not, this risks becoming a very long, boring movie about traumatised demigods spending their final waking aeons apologising profusely to assorted family members – or possibly meeting slightly different versions of themselves, and waiting patiently for Downey Jr to explain why he came back evil.Explore more on these topicsFilmWeek in geekAvengers: DoomsdayX-MenChris EvansChris HemsworthRobert Downey JrMarvelcommentShareReuse this content"

You absolutely marvel at her in this darker second outingRachel AroestiFri 9 Jan 2026 03.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 9 Jan 2026 03.16 ESTShareThe problem with havingErin Dohertystar in your TV drama is that it makes it extremely difficult to tell whether it’s any good or not. The 33-year-old is more than an impressive actor – she is a magnetic presence, able to sell the idea that sheactuallyisher character in a way few others can (a particularly impressive feat considering her breakthrough was playing Princess Anne in The Crown). As such, Doherty’s participation in a series can elevate the premise, plot and script in a slightly confusing way. Watching the first few episodes of Steven Knight’s late-Victorian thrillerA Thousand Blows, I wasn’t sure whether I was genuinely enjoying the programme or simply marvelling at Doherty’s effervescent turn as wily, tough-as-boots pickpocketing queen Mary Carr.Series two makes it easier to spot the difference. While the first outing suffered from its share of heavy-handed exposition, the tale of an East End boxer (played by Doherty’s Adolescence co-star Stephen Graham) whose local dominance is undone by a smart Jamaican fighter (Malachi Kirby) was propulsive and slick, and the presence of the Forty Elephants – a real all-female crime syndicate – was giddily novel. The rivalry between Henry “Sugar” Goodson (old school, bare-knuckle, chip-on-both-shoulders, mildly deranged) and Hezekiah Moscow (young, fun, good-hearted, and willing to cash in on the gentrified west London boxing scene) was a framework that allowed room for commentary on colonialism, racism, tradition and class. Throw in Mary and her mischievous colleagues and you also had a compelling exploration of female empowerment, poverty and the psychology of risk and reward.This time round, the action is less punchy and amusing, and more just really, really depressing. Admittedly, we did leave things on a three-pronged downer last time: Hezekiah was essentially a pariah, having inadvertently killed white New York boxing champ Buster Williams in the ring; Sugar was desolate, having beaten his brother Edward “Treacle” Goodson (James Nelson-Joyce) to a pulp for a perceived slight; and Mary was persona non grata, having led the Elephants on a perilous wild goose chase after some worthless silver-plated tat and been rejected by Hezekiah after he realised she knew more than she’d let on about his best friend’s murder.Still, things can always be worse. And in the series two opener, they are. Sugar is now a drunken down-and-out, rolling across the Wapping cobbles. Hezekiah is reduced to fighting on the barge-based underground boxing scene in front of openly racist crowds. And Mary is at the beck and call of her ruthless mother Jane (Susan Lynch), who is in turn at the beck and call of her brutal boss Indigo Jeremy (a deeply unsettling Robert Glenister). It’s all very grim.But you can’t keep a morally ambivalent woman down, and soon Mary is back to her old tricks; a bank heist here, a bait and switch there. In lieu of a neat storyline involving Sugar and Hezekiah, it’s Mary’s planned robbery of a Caravaggio with a mesmerist named Sophie Lyons, one of her father’s New York associates, that forms the narrative backbone of this series, and persuades her dispersed band of lady thieves to reunite.‘I wouldn’t answer Stephen Graham’s calls’: Erin Doherty on dreams, danger and ghosting Adolescence’s creatorRead moreHezekiah’s comeback takes a little longer. He spends much of this series unhappily training the puny Prince Albert Victor in the art of boxing before returning to the ring himself. Yet the Goodson brothers aren’t so resilient: with the formerly sensible Treacle transformed by the head injury Sugar inflicted, the pair tag team between patriarchal problem-solving and alcoholic mania – it’s honestly hard to keep up with the frequency Sugar boards and disembarks the wagon.Ostensibly, there is plenty of action – various villains are after our trio of (also villainous) protagonists, and people are hurt along the way – but it doesn’t feel as if much is at stake. At times, Sugar’s aimless bewilderment seems to seep into the bones of the show itself. Hezekiah’s quest to establish himself in Britain while haunted by the violence he witnessed in Jamaica gave series one depth and direction – yet so profound is the boxer’s disillusionment that now even his wins feel hollow. And while Mary can still execute a cunning plan, her joy in bettering her betters also crumbles. Instead we get glimpses of what haunts her: an unhappy childhood; the prospect of an impoverished future and a lonely death. Doherty takes these fleeting insights and turns them into a psychodrama that leaves a lasting impression. But that says more about her talent than the quality of this muddled second outing.A Thousand Blows is on Disney+ now.Explore more on these topicsHistorical drama (TV)TV reviewTelevisionStephen GrahamDramareviewsShareReuse this content"

In 1985, when season one of Wood’s sketch show As Seen on TV aired on BBC2, there were sniffs of doubt that a woman could front a comedy programme, let alone a northern woman. How wrong they were. Clips from the show, featuring Wood, Julie Walters and Celia Imrie, are a hoot: high on a tipsy energy, the performers are all on the edge of collapsing into giggles.View image in fullscreenDawn French and Jennifer Saunders in Becoming Victoria Wood.Photograph: Publicity imageFor those who grew up with Wood as a national treasure, BecomingVictoria Woodwill be a revelation. Her standup routines in the 1980s blazed a trail, with jokes about tampons and cellulite. She had a lonely childhood, was ignored by her mother and was shy and self-conscious about her weight. (Later press coverage fixating on her size was vile.) She didn’t feel clever or good-looking enough but she had a fierce streak of ambition that seemed to come from nowhere.She poked fun of herself in her routines, and her comedy was never unkind; she was instinctively on the side of the underdog. The actor Maxine Peake, who got her break on Wood’s sitcom Dinnerladies, says audiences felt seen by her. “We’re all in it together, but some of us are on the telly,” is how Wood put it.Dawn French and Jennifer Saunders are among the other famous pals interviewed here, alongside friends from university. Wood herself appears on the voiceover, in snippets from interviews prior to herdeath from cancer in 2016 aged 62, which give the film an intimacy that is tenderly moving in places.Becoming Victoria Wood is in UK cinemas from 9 January, and on U&GOLD in February.This article was amended on 9 January 2026 to correct the name ofJulie Walters.Explore more on these topicsDocumentary filmsVictoria WoodTelevisionJulie WaltersCelia ImriereviewsShareReuse this content"

As half of Let’s Eat Grandma, the Norwich native started out making freaky synth-folk the arch syrupiness of which chimed with the then-nascent hyperpop scene: I, Gemini, the duo’s 2016 debut, was outsiderish juvenilia of the most thrilling variety. For its follow-up, I’m All Ears, Hollingworth and her bandmate, Rosa Walton, sharpened their songwriting skills while holding tight to their eccentricities; the result was an album of sensational futurist pop. By 2022’s Two Ribbons, they were slipping into slightly more subdued, conventional territory – albeit retaining enough idiosyncratic sonic detailing to maintain their place at the edge.View image in fullscreenThe artwork for Quicksand Heart.So it takes a moment to adjust to the overt familiarity of Hollingworth’s first solo venture. Like Two Ribbons, it reflects on grief (she lost her partner in 2019) and the temporary disintegration of her lifelong friendship with Walton, except this time the introspection is set to knowingly nostalgic 1980s new wave. When the choruses don’t sparkle, Quicksand Heart can feel like plodding through the past, but the moment Hollingworth lands on an irresistible melody – see: Every Ounce of Me, whose bittersweet bounce bridges the gap between Olivia Rodrigo and the Waterboys – the effect is transcendent. The record peaks with the archetypally perfect powerpop number Appetite and the genre-bending Do You Still Believe in Me? in which Hollingworth patchworks together breakbeats, vertiginously swooping vocals, squealing hair metal bombast and shoegazey dissonance, reminding us of her singular powers in the process.Explore more on these topicsMusicLet's Eat GrandmaPop and rockalbum reviewsShareReuse this content"

In recent years, diaspora artists such as Egyptian producer Abdullah Miniawy, singer Nadah El Shazly and Lebanese singer-songwriter Mayssa Jallad have each released records that combine the Arabic musical tradition of maqam and its slippery melodies with granular electronic sound design, rumbling bass and metallic drum programming to create a dramatic new proposition.View image in fullscreenThe artwork for WahjBeirut-born and Amsterdam-based composer Toni Geitani is the latest to contribute to this growing scene with his masterfully produced second album Wahj (“radiance” in Arabic). Working as a visual artist and sound designer, Geitani is well versed in creating imaginative soundscapes for films such as 2024 sci-fi Radius Collapse, as well as referencing the shadowy nocturnal hiss of producers such as Burial on his dabke-sampling 2018 debut album Al Roujoou Ilal Qamar. On Wahj, he harnesses soaring layali vocalisations, reverb-laden drums and analogue synths to leave a cinematic impression.Opener Hal sets a plaintive tone with a yearning cello solo from Nia Ralinova and Geitani’s melismatic vocals meandering over the slow, thrumming notes of a synthesiser. Its gentle mood is soon shattered, however, by the thundering drums and doomy synths of following numbers Ya Sah and La, the blast beat cacophony of Tuyoor and the industrial techno distortions of Fawqa al Ghaym. With its bellowing vocals and clattering percussive motif, Ya Aman and some similar fare can veer into Hans Zimmer-style heightened melodrama. But Geitani otherwise keeps a deft handle on his world-building, ensuring that threads of unease keep listeners guessing. Highlight Ruwaydan Ruwaydan tempers a pleasant jazz swing groove with an unexpected beat-switch and piercing ney flute line, while closing track Madda Mudadda builds from calming ambience into a crushing chaos of static and whispered melody. Geitani revels in this state of dark tension, creating an album that challenges us to find beauty in a ruinous sound.Also out this monthTuareg groupImarhanrelease their latest album, Essam (City Slang). Moving beyond the psychedelic guitars and yearning vocals of Tuareg assouf (desert blues) pioneers Tinariwen, Essam sees Imarhan including an electronic thump on tracks such as the earworming Derhan N’Oulhine and dancefloor-focused drum programming on Okcheur. Palestinian rapperTamer Nafar’s first English-language album In the Name of the Father, the Imam & John Lennon (Levantine Music) channels everything from a James Brown funk swagger on Rock It Like a Palestinian to 808 trap bass on Nana, delivering a brash yet tonally uneven set of tracks. Brazilian jazz groupGrupo Um’s Nineteen Seventy Seven (Far Out Recordings) is a rare gem of a rediscovery. Comprised of members from Hermeto Pascoal’s mid-70s São Paulo band, the quintet’s previously lost second album is a crate-diggers’ delight of propulsive funk-jazz fusion, analogue synths and soaring horns.Explore more on these topicsMusicGlobal album of the monthExperimental musicreviewsShareReuse this content"

The 1935 song in which he captured the idea, a lilting tango, forms the lodestar ofKatie Bray’s voyage through Weill’s chameleonic songwriting career, undertaken alongside the pianist William Vann, accordionist Murray Grainger and double bassist Marianne Schofield, the latter moonlighting from the Hermes Experiment.First, we hear a haunting, unaccompanied musing on the Youkali melody, then more of these punctuate the programme until we reach the song in full at the end. The journey takes in numbers in German, French and English – some familiar, some not – including a couple of songs written for the Huckleberry Finn musical Weill was working on at the time of his death.View image in fullscreenThe artwork for In Search of Youkali: Songs of Kurt Weill.Photograph: ChandosBray and Vann have been developing this programme together for years, and it shows in their easy fluency; the other two instruments are used tellingly, painting in subtle rather than primary colours. As for Bray, she is outstanding. From the deliciously acerbic Barbarasong to the bleakly controlled emotion in Je ne t’aime pas, her singing is a demonstration of how an elevated, “trained” voice can sound wonderfully communicative and natural in this music.Allow content provided by a third party?This article includes content hosted onembed.music.apple.com.

I didn’t learn to read in the first years of school and became entrenched in illiteracy until my grandmother, a retired primary school teacher, intervened. I loved the Swallows and Amazons series, and especially Swallowdale in which a shipwreck is redeemed and the adults provide exactly the right support when the children mess up.My favourite book growing upThe Little House on the Prairie series by Laura Ingalls Wilder, whose politics I now find obviously objectionable. I often tell students that what you don’t get is what gets you, and I’m sure the obsession with rugged independence and the repression of foundational violence did me no good, but I liked the landscapes and the combination of domesticity and adventure.The book that changed me as a teenagerTeenagers are easily led. I saw myself in some of the plain, clever girls of Victorian fiction, reinforcing the 1990s message that cleverness was unattractive and attractiveness was stupid. Young women shouldn’t be allowed to read the mid-century canon until they’ve learned critical thinking; the Beat poets, Updike, Amis et al taught me to see women and the world through the eyes of white men, and also to admire an excellent sentence. I suppose both were useful in their way.The writer who changed my mindAll books change my mind, that’s what they are for. Recently Christina Sharpe’s Ordinary Notes altered the way I understand much of the world around me.The book that made me want to be a writerI don’t think it was a book. Before I could write, my party trick was storytelling. Sometimes other parents would call the house late at night to have my parents bring me to the phone and admit to my sleepless little friends that the ghost stories I’d told earlier weren’t true.Theauthor I came back toI’ve just rediscovered Barbara Pym. When I first read her, I was so determined not to become a valiantly cheerful and shabby middle-aged English woman of limited means that I didn’t want to know if they had inner lives. I wouldn’t say I’m now particularly cheerful, valiantly or otherwise, but apart from that – well, let’s just say she’s a brilliant novelist and I was wrong.The book I rereadMost books worth reading are worth rereading. I revisit Austen, Charlotte Brontë, George Eliot, noticing how their teenaged heroines and wise or bitter older women look different as I age. Other lodestars include Janet Frame’s autobiography, everything written by Miriam Toews, Bill Reid’s essays on art. And we should not forget the books of staying alive either: Meera Sodha’s and Anna Jones’s cookbooks fall open at the right pages and Felix Ford’s and Kate Davies’ knitting books bring happy hours and favourite jumpers.The book I could never read againI never liked Wuthering Heights as much as Jane Eyre, and these days I can’t see around the eroticised abuse, not that there isn’t some of that in Jane Eyre too. Exemplary narrative structure all the same.The book I discovered later in lifeDiscovering books is like discovering landscapes; they were already there. I love it when writers reach me in translation decades after they were published: Magda Szabo, Alba De Céspedes, Azar Nafisi.The book I am currently readingI am a polyamorous reader: Helen Garner’s How to End a Story; Gun-Britt Sundström’s Engagement; Kathleen Jamie’s Selected Poems.Ripeness by Sarah Moss is published by Picador.

This poignant and perceptive coming-of-age story, about two strangers who become star-crossed lovers, is a powerful portrait of the lived realities of immigrants in Britain, and of love as home, hope and destiny.Newly arrived in England following an arranged marriage with British-Indian Rajiv, Mira feels increasingly out of place as she finds out that Rajiv holds secrets and loves someone else. On the eponymous Belgrave Road in Leicester, entire days go by “without sight of an English person”, and Mira feels “disappointed that England wasn’t as foreign or as mysterious as she had hoped”. She takes English classes, finds companionship in her mother-in-law and fills her days with household chores, but nothing shifts her deep loneliness.Tahliil is an asylum seeker from Somalia, who, together with his sister, Sumayya, joins their mother in Leicester. He works as an at-home carer and at a cash-and-carry for cash-in-hand while he waits for the Home Office to grant his request for asylum. With a chequered past and an uncertain future, he feels untethered to and untrusting of the world around him. That is, until he sees Mira, who has started working as a cook at the neighbouring sweet shop.With Belgrave Road, the debut author proves that he can sustain a well-crafted and plotted novel over 350 pagesWhat follows is a love story that is tender and true, fragile and arguably forbidden: “In the space of a few syllables, the world began to contract around them.” In a classic will they, won’t they tale that keeps the reader on tenterhooks, the novel dwells on the unknown: the precariousness of their individual futures and of course their future together, “how unprepared he was, how unprepared they both were, for their own happiness”.In the face of such uncertainty, and through Mira and Tahliil’s in-laws and parents – who have endured that often elusive experience called life – Chauhan cleverly shows the stark contrasts in beliefs between generations. Mira’s own mother believes “the body to be a vessel of truth – every feeling, every struggle woven into its meat, its bones”. Now, as Mira looks at her mother-in-law, who suffers abuse at her husband’s hands, she wonders whether those words hold true, or whether “the body was as prone to deceit as everything else”. Tahliil, too, questions his mother’s words when she says: “Sometimes you have to wait. What is meant to be yours will always be yours.”And although Chauhan rehearses some familiar narratives about south Asian men and arranged marriages, he smashes one of the deepest-set stereotypes in south Asian stories: that of the evil, wicked mother-in-law. Mira’s deep bond with hersaasuis an intergenerational portrait of two south Asian women navigating the trials and tribulations of immigrant and family life. Ultimately, what emerges between them is a strong sisterhood and a fierce duty of care towards each other. Small gestures of love – oiling each other’s hair, making food – turn into radical acts of protection and liberation in a household where the men make their presence felt with a heavy hand or rough tongue, so much so that when Mira contemplates abandoning her marriage, it’s this loss that we prematurely mourn.Chauhan’s short fiction has already been acclaimed, and with Belgrave Road, the debut author proves that he can also sustain a well-crafted and plotted novel over 350 pages. This story of love beyond borders and immigrants without anchor points (“Each time a person moves country, they leave a part of themselves behind. We end up homeless. Belonging nowhere”) is full of heart and heartbreak, and defiantly explores the destinies we write for ourselves.At one point, Tahliil’s father tells him “that the past was like a piece of string, stitched to the inside of a person’s heart. One could never be entirely free of it.” Belgrave Road shows us that, sometimes, the promise of a future is all it takes to fight the ghosts of one’s past.Belgrave Road by Manish Chauhan is published by Faber (£16.99).

So it is with Kate Owens’ Cooking With Kathryn, in which a woman from America’s Bible belt struggles to keep up appearances as she hosts, for the first time, her late mom’s community cooking show. Owens was nominated for the best newcomer award at Edinburgh fringe for this one, and you can see why. She’s a teasing and charismatic presence here, playing a type – woman on the edge, her panic barely concealed by too much makeup and a flashing smile – that audiences will instantly recognise.Maybe she’s too recognisable: the show’s argument, that Christian zealotry subjugates women, is nothing if not familiar, and Owens discloses Kathryn’s particular crisis (her tyrannical mom; her lovelessness) very explicitly right from the get-go. But if the terrain feels well trodden, Owens brings it to sparkling life, as the daughter flailing to become the home-maker of her late mom’s dreams. The cookery workshops descend into slapstick disaster, via an erotic egg-beating skit and a hastily improvised tinfoil bandage. Proceedings are given a psychotically needy edge when Kathryn’s supposed sweetheart is discovered sitting in the front row.‘I’d never told the same joke twice!’: the explosive rise of Ayoade Bamgboye, Edinburgh’s best new comedianRead moreThen the show takes a gross-out turn, as our host must concoct and consume the unlovely “biblical brew” handed down by generations of Kathryns before her. She turns instead to her preferred tipple, cueing up some fine drunken acting by Owens in a performance that doesn’t stint on broad physical comedy.Perhaps the last 10 minutes don’t give the show quite the climax it deserves, as Kathryn sings a so-so song about her deviations from the path of Christian chastity, and her mother is summoned from the grave to issue a too neat absolution. But there’s been lots to enjoy along the way: Owens’ deft clownish touch keeps every sequence pregnant with possibility, right up to the “deflowering ceremony” involving Kathryn, two plucky punters and an ominous bedsheet. I would say she has the audience in the palm of her hand here, but as her cookery efforts demonstrate, Kathryn’s hands are a precarious place to be.AtSoho theatre, London, until 10 JanuaryExplore more on these topicsComedySoho theatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

But if those are the scenes that make it on to Christmas cards, this is more suited to the January blues – a disabused recognition of winter’s toughness. Van de Velde paints a dreary and biting afternoon. Isolated figures trudge on an icy road and tree trunks twist eerily in the bleak melancholy light. Even a game on the ice looks dispirited, and the house nearby seems dead and icy rather than offering a warm fire. The chilly realism has a modern sadness that makes you think of later north European artists such as Van Gogh and Munch.The National Gallery, LondonSign up to the Art Weekly newsletterIf you don’t already receive our regular roundup of art and design news via email,please sign up here.Get in touchIf you have any questions or comments about any of our newsletters please emailnewsletters@theguardian.comExplore more on these topicsArt and designArt Weekly newsletterPaintingPhotographyArtExhibitionsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

This is partly because Greenland was one of those films in which Gerard Butler runs around looking as if he’s desperately trying to hold in a whopper of a fart. However, releasing a film about Americans focusing all their effort on Greenland at this precise moment in time feels a little on the nose.Greenland review – Gerard Butler v comet in solid disaster thrillerRead moreAlso, and hopefully this isn’t a spoiler, but it’s weird to make Greenland 2 when the entire world was destroyed at the end of Greenland 1. In that film, you will remember, Butler and his family had to get to Greenland because the planet was about to be pummelled by meteors.But hey, at least we can add the Greenland series to the long list of films that revel in destroying notable global landmarks. The trailer for the second one alone contains impressive shots of a half blown up Sydney Opera House and the Eiffel Tower listing over like a big banana.Depending on your point of view, this is either brilliant or depressing. For some, seeing a landmark get the snot kicked out of it by an extinction-level event is a decades-old cinematic mainstay. For others, it might start to feel a little bit tiresome. Really? The Eiffel Tower? Again?Some new researchby, fittingly, the insurance company MS Amlin, compiles the landmarks that get destroyed most often in movies. If it proves anything at all, it’s that Hollywood has a very shallow imagination.Prior to the Greenland films, for instance, the Eiffel Tower has been destroyed in Armageddon, Mars Attacks! Team America: World Police, Category 7: The End of the World, Aftermath: Population Zero, GI Joe: The Rise of Cobra and Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs. And, while not part of the MS Amlin list, it’s worth pointing out that the Sydney Opera House has previously been destroyed in X-Men: Apocalypse, Godzilla: Final Wars and Mega Shark vs Mecha Shark.View image in fullscreenBig Ben and Parliament destroyed in Reign of Fire.Photograph: ReutersHowever, these are by no means the most destroyed landmarks on the planet. Big Ben has got it at least nine times previously, in films such as Reign of Fire, V for Vendetta, London has Fallen, Flood, Gorgo and Tom & Jerry: The Fast and the Furry. And the Golden Gate Bridge has been wrecked at least 13 times, in films including Superman, San Andreas, Terminator: Genisys, Pacific Rim, Mega Shark vs Giant Octopus and It Came from Beneath the Sea.Way out in front, though, is the Statue of Liberty, which has been targeted in (deep breath): The Last War, Planet of the Apes, National Lampoon’s European Vacation, Superman IV: The Quest for Peace, Batman Forever, Independence Day, Mars Attacks, Deep Impact, Aftershock: Earthquake in New York, Artificial Intelligence, The Day After Tomorrow, Category 7: The End of the World, Tom and Jerry: The Fast & the Furry, Superman II, Transformers, Cloverfield, NYC: Tornado Terror, 2012 and GI Joe: The Rise of Cobra.This teaches us two things. The first is that we’ve all clearly been sleeping on Tom & Jerry: The Fast and the Furry. The second is that the film-makers of the world desperately need to find new landmarks to explode.View image in fullscreenClive Owen and Clare-Hope Ashitey in Children of Men, 2006.Photograph: AJ Pics/AlamyIt has been done in the past. When Harry O Hoyt chose to destroy something with a dinosaur in 1925, for example, he settled on the Blue Posts pub in Soho. Or, when Alfonso Cuarón decided to depict a real-life location to show untold depths of destruction in Children of Men, he opted for Bexhill-on-Sea. And where did Marvel choose to stage its most spectacular ever superhero-on-superhero battle when it came to filming Captain America: Civil War? That’s right, Leipzig airport.We need more of this, frankly. The movies can no longer rely on blowing up the same tired old landmarks. Let’s have a bit of invention. The next time aliens invade, let’s have them train their firepower onthe Spam Museumin Austin, Minnesota. If an out-of-control foreign government decides to train its nuclear arsenal on Europe, then let it aim its missiles at that tiny statue of the urinating boy in Brussels. We’ve seen meteors hit Earth a million times before, but have any of them ever taken out theCleethorpes Coast Light Railway? No, and this is precisely why cinema is dying.Explore more on these topicsFilm industryAction and adventure filmsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

So in this week’s newsletter we’re launching a new regular feature, Origin stories, where we’ll look at how the Guardian first covered some now very familiar pop culture figures or institutions. And you’ll find out who the tyke above is, from a 1973 photoshoot, at the end.To the archives!The BeatlesView image in fullscreenCavern Club boys … the Beatles in 1963.Photograph: Hulton Archive/Getty ImagesThe Guardian, regrettably, wasn’t at the Cavern or the clubs of Hamburg for an on-the-ground report of the Fabs’ early years. Instead, the first appearance that we can find is in an article about therise of “coffee dance clubs”, basement venues in Manchester where a “metropolitan mixture of artist, Continental girls who could be students, but may just be au pair, and young manual workers having a fairly inexpensive night on the town” would dance till they dropped (though apparently not drink much coffee). “Most of the clubs have twist or jazz groups, the Beatles for instance, or Bee Bumble and the Stingers, playing on some nights,” is all the mention that John, Paul, George and Ringo get. This was in January 1963, right as Please Please Me was climbing the charts: by the end of the year Beatlemania had truly hit.Marilyn MonroeView image in fullscreen‘Irresistible’, eventually … Marilyn Monroe circa 1951.Photograph: Michael Ochs Archives/Getty ImagesNorma Jeane’s first Guardian mention is just as inauspicious as the Beatles’, a brief mention in a short review of early 50s psychological thriller Don’t Bother to Knock. “The film makes a slow start and does not succeed in ending up as anything very special,” was the verdict of the critic. Things hardly improved with the review of her next leading role, in Niagara: “Miss Monroe has been compared with the late Jean Harlow: here she only proves that little roles suit her best.” The Guardian would eventually be convinced of Marilyn’s charms. By the time of Some Like it Hot in 1959, she was being described as “irresistible”.EastEndersView image in fullscreenWalford calling … EastEnders is born in 1985.Photograph: BBC Pictures Archives“Albert Square will soon be as familiar a national landmark as Coronation Street, and rather more up to date, the BBC hopes,” opened the Guardian article in October 1984 about the announcement of the Beeb’s new soap. Not a bad prediction! Four months later, EastEnders began on BBC One. Hugh Hebert’s opening night review for the paper was maybe a little sniffy (“It wasn’t exactly like First Looking into Chapman’s Homer or turning to page one of War and Peace”), but overall cautiously positive: “It’s pretty much as expected, Coronation Street with added abrasives and a cockney accent, and at that level it’s a good professional stab at the task: and it looks a lot more realistic than Granada’s apparently endless saga.” Forty years later, both keep trundling on.NintendoView image in fullscreenPixel perfect … 1981’s Donkey Kong.Photograph: video game screenshotThe first mention that we could find of the planet-straddling gaming company couldn’t be more dismissive. “The next inevitable advance of those puerile video games has duly arrived in Japan – the pocket game and watch combined,” sniffed a brief entry on a new Nintendo product in the tech column What’s New in 1980. The Japanese firm’s next mention would come four years later, right in the middle of the home-gaming boom, in a piece by the Guardian’s pipe-smoking tech journoJack Schofieldabout plagiarism among video game companies. “Micro Power’s Acorn BBC Game Killer Gorilla closely resembles the Nintendo Game Donkey Kong, licensed to Atari. And there are numerous similar games for other machines … unless the existence of Kongo Kong, Wally Kong, Killer Kong, Dinkey Kong, Krazy Kong, and Donkey King is just an astonishing coincidence.”Claudia WinklemanWe’ve saved the best one for last. You might have thought that the first mention of The Traitors’ presenter/chief tormentor would have come in the 90s, when she was starting out on TV. But no, it actually came decades earlier, when Winkleman, as a toddler, appeared in a photoshoot for a 1973 piece on children’s clothes. Sporting a lively string-bowed smock (“embroidered Indian smocks and Kurtas lends itself well to small-fry fashion”, the piece suggests) and stripy bell-bottom trousers, Winkleman was already a fashion icon – though the trademark fingerless gloves and severe fringe were still to come.---If you want to dig further into the archive yourself,support the Guardian by signing up for Digital plusand get access to the full 200-year archive.To read the complete version of this newsletterplease subscribeto receive The Guide in your inbox every FridayExplore more on these topicsCultureThe Guide newsletternewslettersShareReuse this content"

No small compliment given that the film is more than seven hours long.Tarr, who has died aged 70, earned the reverence of cinephiles on the basis of a handful of austere, poetic and painstakingly slow black-and-white films including Damnation (1987),Werckmeister Harmonies(2000) and his swansongThe Turin Horse(2011).Simple narratives set in remote Hungarian communities were rendered knotty with psychological depth, a sensitivity to loss and desolation, and a near-constant air of foreboding. An acute, multilayered use of sound contributed to his skill at locating the epic and nightmarish in the quotidian. The White Review magazine compared him to Bruegel in his fêting of everyday life.Tarr was known chiefly for his preference for long unbroken takes; Sátántangó, for instance, begins with an eight-minute shot of cows trudging through mud. It might have lasted even longer if only film stock was not capped at around 11 minutes per reel – “The worst form of censorship,” he lamented.In an age of accelerated editing and enfeebled attention spans, he was unfashionable to say the least. The average length of a shot in Sátántangó is two-and-a-half minutes; even The Turin Horse, a mere foal at 146 minutes, contains only 30 shots.View image in fullscreenWerckmeister Harmonies, 2000.Photograph: Courtesy CurzonHis films followed “the logic of life”, with all the repetition, frustration and even boredom this implied. In Sátántangó, which tells of isolated villagers hatching a criminal plan while maddeningly unable to escape their miserable surroundings, recurring scenes of dismal revelry create a powerful sense of oppression and futility.Tarr insisted that he thought only of the film in hand while he was working, rather than any wider political or theoretical resonances. His goal, he said, was “to talk about a kind of eternity … That’s why you never see any cars or anything in my movies … I understand you have to pay your bills today, but your life – it has to be a little bit cosmic, not this kind of bang bang bang.”He conceded, though, that there were warnings about populism ingrained in pictures such as Sátántangó and Werckmeister Harmonies, which both concern the spell cast over villagers by a sinister figure. A fierce opponent of the Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orbán, Tarr labelled the Hungarian regime “the shame of our country” and accused it of “a political war against intellectuals”.Spotty distribution and an off-putting but undeserved reputation for inordinate length (aside from Sátántangó, none of his films exceeded three hours) were among the obstacles that stood between Tarr and the sort of art-film royalty status enjoyed by many of his favourite directors, such as Andrei Tarkovsky, Rainer Werner Fassbinder or his own countrymanMiklós Jancsó.Unlike those auteurs, he achieved no crossover successes, failed to penetrate the cultural consciousness, and influenced only the occasional film-maker, such as Gus Van Sant, whose experimental odysseyGerry(2002), starring Matt Damon and Casey Affleck as friends lost in Death Valley, included a thank you to Tarr in its end credits.View image in fullscreenThe Man from London, with Tilda Swinton, 2007.Photograph: Moviestore Collection Ltd/AlamyTarr’s reputation for dourness and solemnity was far from the whole story. “My opinion is that we were doing comedies,” he said. “You can laugh a lot.”That went some way toward explaining the arch dialogue in his 2007 filmThe Man from London. (“May I go up to my room?” “As you wish. But your overcoat stays here.”) Or the picture’s bar scene, which ends, for no apparent reason, with an elderly man perching a snooker ball on the bridge of his nose while a fellow drinker balances a chair precariously over the first man’s head.Tarr was born in Pécs, Hungary, and raised in Budapest by parents who both worked in theatre: his father, also called Béla, designed sets, while his mother, Mari, was a prompter. He was briefly a child actor before beginning at the age of 16 to shoot socially attuned documentary shorts. One of these, about a family living in a squat, landed the emerging film-maker in trouble with the police, who evicted the family and arrested him.He worked as a labourer, a caretaker and a receptionist, then fell into the orbit of the Béla Belázs studio, which funded his debut feature, Family Nest (1979), made when he was 22. Boasting non-professional actors,vérité-style camerawork and a blunt critique of communist policies, this slice of social realism gave little indication of the formidable style that would characterise his later work. His next two films, The Outsider (1981) and The Prefab People (1982), continued in this vein.A 1982 TV version of Macbeth hinted that formalist concerns were increasingly on his mind. Shot on video and running for just over an hour in total, the adaptation was split into two shots. The first lasted five minutes, the second 57.Though Almanac of Fall (1984) was filmed in colour and trafficked partly in realism and domesticity (it was compared by the critic Jonathan Rosenbaum to Strindberg and Cassavetes), it showed the aesthetic fastidiousness of this self-confessed perfectionist and autocrat beginning to exert itself.View image in fullscreenThe farmer (János Derzsi) and his daughter (Erika Bók) in The Turin Horse, 2011.Photograph: Photo 12/AlamyIt was with Damnation, his film about a recluse besotted with a cabaret singer, that the vital elements of the mature Tarr first aligned: black-and-white cinematography, a screenplay by the Nobel prize-winning writerLászló Krasznahorkai(who wrote thenovelsfrom which Sátántangó and Werckmeister Harmonies were adapted), extended takes and inclement weather.His arthouse reputation was so exalted after Sátántangó and Werckmeister Harmonies that it was only a matter of time before he worked with Tilda Swinton. She starred in The Man from London, adapted from Georges Simenon’s crime novel. Production was interrupted by the death of its producer,Humbert Balsan, which sent Tarr into a depression. The resulting film seemed less assured, and was received rather more coolly than usual.He returned to form with the Nietzsche-inspired The Turin Horse, which charts the declining fortunes of a farmer and his adult daughter after their horse refuses to budge from its stable. Their solitude intensifies until they are staring into a barren well, or facing each other silently across a dark room. The picture was steeped in rustic, ageless imagery. I Used to Be a Filmmaker, a 2013 documentary about its making, amusingly revealed that dramatic visual effects were achieved by positioning a wind machine and a helicopter just out of frame.That documentary also included testimony by collaborators, one of whom noted Tarr’s ability to inspire loyalty in his cast and crew – “to gather people with very different personalities and march them together down the path of his crazy monomania”.Many of his films were made with his editor and first wife Ágnes Hranitzsky (sometimes credited as co-director); the cinematographer Fred Kelemen, who later established his own directing career; and the composer Míhaly Víg, who also starred in Sátántangó as the charlatan and con-man Irimiás.View image in fullscreenDamnation, 1988, which has a screenplay by the Nobel prize-winning writer László Krasznahorkai.Photograph: TCD/Prod.DB/AlamyAfter retiring from directing, he made shorts, produced other people’s features, including the Icelandic folk horrorLamb(2021) and the forthcoming queer drama Places Half Empty (2026), and ran film.factory, a Sarajevo film school.Interviewed by the Guardian in 2024, hedescribedfilm-making as a “drug” and confessed he was “still a junkie”. He also sounded an unsentimental note about his decision to retire. “The work is done,” he said, “and you can take it or leave it.”A new generation of cinephiles, craving more serious and exacting pleasures than those offered by the instant gratification of scrolling, binge-watching and multi-screening, seem increasingly to be choosing to take it. In Sight & Sound magazine’s 2022 poll of critics and film-makers to find the greatest films of all time, Sátántangó was placed at No 78, level with work by Charlie Chaplin andJean-Luc Godard.Tarr’s marriage to Hranitzsky ended in divorce. He is survived by his second wife, the art curator Amila Ramovic.Béla Tarr, film director, born 21 July 1955; died 6 January 2026Explore more on these topicsFilmFilm adaptationsobituariesShareReuse this content"

Now she’s determined to use success to bring more working-class voices  into comedyFri 9 Jan 2026 04.00 ESTShareJade Franks was scrubbing loos while her peers were playing polo. A working-class student at Cambridge, living a double life as a cleaner alongside full-time studies, she has parlayed her experience into her winningly titled playEat the Rich (But Maybe Not Me Mates x). An early, buzzy hit at the Edinburgh festival fringe, the comic skewering of the Oxbridge elite sold out its initial run, added extra shows and won multiple awards, including a sought-after Fringe First. With a London run and regional tour about to kick off, Eat the Rich now follows in the footsteps of Fleabag and Baby Reindeer in being developed for TV, with a bidding war seeing the show currently under development with Netflix and Adolescence director Philip Barantini’s indie company It’s All Made Up Productions. But Franks is a grafter, and she’s only just getting started.“I was always really ambitious,” says Franks, in her lush scouse accent, wearing thick cat-eye glasses. “I don’t think I was fully aware of class until it was stopping me from getting where I wanted.” Fictionalising her own life, Eat the Rich undercuts Franks’s effortless charm with rage at wealth inequality. Tracing her first term, the arcane rituals and alien environments get her into regular pickles simply because she doesn’t understand the state of play: dinners are suddenly conducted in Latin; money-oozing peers mimic her accent; and the grated cheddar she brings to a party is swiftly rejected from the cheese board.Bubbling beneath the daily absurdities is Franks’s fear of her job being discovered, which breaks the university’s rule against working during term-time. In reality, it was only just before finals that Franks eventually learned about the bursaries that allow financially struggling students not to have to work alongside their studies. She had spent the last three years secretly employed as a cleaner, as in the show, as well as working for a punt boat tour guide company, hiding her face while out on the rivers for fear of being caught. “I wasn’t good enough to do the tours,” she laughs, “so I was in the cash office and moving the boats,” she splays her hands, showing off her long pointed, patterned acrylics, “with nails like these!”Franks grew up in Wallasey, Wirral. None of her family were involved in theatre. “I’m just an attention seeker,” she deadpans. “I went to local drama classes in the church hall, while my mates were getting drunk in the park.” She got into drama school for sixth form, but even with the scholarship they offered, she couldn’t afford to go. After getting her A-levels, she applied again, getting acccepted by Lamda and later Rada, but once again couldn’t afford to take up the offers. “That lit the fire in me,” she says, “and that only became worse when I got to Cambridge.”View image in fullscreenJade Franks in Eat the Rich (but maybe not me mates x).Photograph: Holly RevellWhile the autobiographical show makes use of artistic licence, the classist encounters are all real. In the play, Franks’s sister comes down to visit and is refused from a college dinner by a sniffy professor for what she’s wearing. “That was completely true,” Franks says. Finding her email of complaint over the incident, Franks was taken aback by how apologetic her tone was. “It’s mad to see how much I’ve changed. Now, I wouldn’t stand for that. I’m so much more secure in myself about how you should be treated and why people are treating you that way.” How does her sister feel? “She’s thrilled she gets her own section,” Franks grins. “She was like: ‘Why did you change my name and not your name? I want everyone to know.’”Taking inspiration from the razor-sharp work of Michaela Coel, and always knowing she wanted it to eventually be a TV show, Franks started developing Eat the Rich in her third year of uni. At that point, she wasn’t getting cast beyond small roles (“I’d never be a Juliet”), so she started working up her story as a standup set.Comedyfelt like the right path for it.“I wasn’t watering down any of the fury or the politics,” she says. “I was just sneaking it in the back door.” After graduating, she worked as an education assistant at London’s Royal Court theatre, where she met much of the Eat the Rich team: director Tatenda Shamiso, dramaturg Ellie Fulcher and producer Jasmyn Fisher-Ryner. Being made redundant after a change of artistic director “gave me a kick up the ass”, Franks says, to give her own show a go.But she didn’t have the cash to just make it happen. “There’s no way to go to the fringe if you don’t have parents that can pay for it,” says Franks, “or savings! People have savings in their early 20s. Who?” She moved back home with her parents. “I had literally no money and my mental health was not great. I decided to go sober, which changed my life.”Even if we didn’t do the show, it wouldn’t help – I was already in loads of debtMuch of the final script was written in her head while invigilating student exams in the summer, keeping one eye on ensuring the kids weren’t cheating, then racing out of the hall to tap out ideas on her phone. “It was a period of my family being quite worried about me,” she says, “and then,” with the show’s success, “being like: Oh thank God.”But the road was bumpy, and the show very nearly didn’t happen. The support of a private investor fell apart shortly before the fringe, and by then, Franks had put all the costs on a credit card. “So even if we didn’t do the show, it wouldn’t help, because I was already in loads of debt.” She and Shamiso made a video explaining the situation, and the response online was phenomenal, with some cash sent from old school friends and hefty amounts from generous (and rich) Cambridge pals, plus the support of working-class artists who championed the team – “before they even knew if the show was good yet!” – such as Big Boys comedianJack Rooke, who Franks calls “a guardian angel of this industry”.And yet. Despite Eat the Rich being a huge success at the fringe, already overcoming a multitude of barriers, it didn’t break even. When Franks had done the fringe as a student, she’d been “brainwashed by the mentality that we’re all gonna work ourselves to the bone, not get paid, and get the flu”. Her producer wouldn’t stand for that. The team paid themselves fairly and stayed in accommodation that meant they didn’t all have to share a bed, rat-king style. But because of the wild way theatre works, that meant no profit. Every step of the way, Franks kept coming up against the barriers preventing people like her from being able to make art that didn’t shred their health and require the safety blanket of family money. “Fringe should be a place where people can fail,” she says, “but you can’t afford to. I couldn’t afford to.”Fleabag and Baby Reindeer superproducer Francesca Moody: ‘The next best play can come from anywhere’Read moreHer desire to alter the unjust model of the industry spreads further than the shows she makes. Beyond Eat the Rich, Franks is a freelance creative consultant for theatre, drawing in more diverse audiences and making people feel welcome. Far from an add-on, this is essential, especially as theatre moves towards dynamic pricing, making it even harder for less well-off audiences to attend. TV deals are famously fickle, but if the Netflix series comes off, and she makes “loads of money”, Franks is determined to use her success to give others a leg-up. She is “overwhelmed and excited” about working with fellow scouser Barantini. “It was crazy,” she says of the post-fringe attention, and the masses of meetings she had with TV producers, “being able to choose. I think everyone understood why working with Phil would feel like home. But it’s early days.”What would she do with the money, all being well? “At the moment, my outreach stuff on the West End is just me with my massive spreadsheet,” Franks says. “I’d love to set that up as a business and have a team. Get every commercial theatre to sign up to a scheme that I am,” – she laughs as she finds the right word – “landlord of, where you have to have an allocation of good seats for £10 that my team gets to the right people.” She has big ideas for the fringe, too: to make it a space where people can try, and fail, without fear of losing it all.Having fought her way through the elite, inequality-ridden landscapes of Cambridge and UK theatre, the urge to do something about it all, to smash down the doors keeping some people out, is bone-deep. “I can’t change the system by doing a silly little one woman show,” Franks says. But that won’t stop her trying.Eat the Rich (But Maybe Not Me Mates x) isatSoho theatre, London, 12 to 31 January; Liverpool Everyman, 16 to 18 April; and Bristol Old Vic, 28 April to 2 May.Explore more on these topicsComedyOxbridge and elitismAccess to universityfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Instead, it’s what is inside that counts.So-called analogue bags, filled with activities such as crosswords, knitting, novels and journals, have become the unexpected accessory of the season.They are being championed by millennials and gen Z as a way to reduce screen time. Similar to aprep bag, the idea is that the bag or basket should contain the essentials needed to remain offline for as long as possible. One user describes it as a “toy box for your attention span”.David Sax, the author ofThe Revenge of Analog, approves of the trend. “The idea that we can all just get into a lotus pose and fall into a state of meditative bliss is wildly unrealistic for the vast majority of us,” he says. “Our phones have everything you could ever ask for, so you need an alternative to hand in order to fill that void.”The term was coined bySierra Campbell, a 31-year-old content creator based in California. “My biggest fear is that I’ll lie on my deathbed and regret how much time I spent on phone,” she says in a TikTok video in which she first suggests the concept.The idea has – somewhat paradoxically – become hugely popular on social media, with users posting videos talking through the contents of their analogue bags and sharing tips on what to fill them with. Some refer to them as their “stop scrolling” bags.There are analogue wicker baskets for evenings on the sofa, bags for long journeys and even some for romantic weekends away. Suggestions include doing a joint wordsearch rather than playing Wordle individually.Campbell’sJanuary analogue bag video– featuring a subscription to the New Yorker magazine, gel pens and a sketchbook – has been viewed more than 200,000 times in five days.The trend forms part of a wider backlash against a culture of doomscrolling and the pressure to always be online. According to Ofcom, the UK telecoms regulator, the average adult in Great Britainchecks their phone every 12 minutes. A 2022 survey by USwitch found that the average daily time among UK adults averaged five hours, in addition to screen-related work tasks.View image in fullscreenThe analogue bag offers a way to reclaim attention and minimise screen use.Photograph: LumiNola/Getty ImagesAnalogue bags sit alongside a resurgence in analogue technologies such asvinyl records,physical magazinesandpoint-and-shoot cameras. Offline, in-person activities – including“cosy hobbies”such as pottery classes, crochet circles and evendinner parties– are also on the rise.Campbell says the catalyst for the analogue bag, which has reduced her screen time from seven hours a day to three, came from reading Charles Duhigg’sThe Power of Habit. In the book, Duhigg outlines three components of a habit: cue, routine and reward.Rather than trying to eliminate a bad habit, he argues that it is more effective to keep the cue and reward while changing the routine. For Campbell, this meant reaching for a bag of screen-free activities instead of her phone.“If you go to your phone for news, put a newspaper in your bag,” Campbell says. “If it’s for entertainment, try a good book. For creative inspiration, sketching tools or knitting. It’s just like physical fitness – whatever activity you’ll actually do is the best one to include.”Rather than a brief digital detox, the analogue bag trend suggests people are attempting to change their relationship with screens for the long term.Pete Etchells, a professor of psychology and science communication at Bath Spa University and author of Unlocked: The Real Science of Screen Time, argues that rather than being addicted to our phones, we have simplyformed habits around their use. He hopes the rise of analogue bags is “a shift in how people understand their relationship with technology”.“We do have agency and control over what we do with our time,” Etchells says. “And if you are not happy with how you use your phone and how you use social media, it’s great that people are starting to think about what the [options] look like – and how we can make access easier to those.”Explore more on these topicsHandbagsAccessoriesSocial mediaSmartphonesMobile phones (Technology)Mobile phones (Money)TelecomsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It shows the unwavering support she gave me when he was bornEmma BeddingtonFri 9 Jan 2026 07.00 ESTShareThis picture of my mother, me and my eldest son, Theo, was taken the morning after he was born in May 2002, in University College Hospital, London.There are a lot of things I love about it. I love the fact my mother is exquisitely dressed – she’s wearing her pearls! She always looked very elegant at this time in her life and enjoyed clothes (we bought that suit on a day out together). I love the composition too – our three dark heads, faces in profile and the way our three hands are aligned. I love the miracle of my son’s intricate little shell of an ear, the nose (his dad’s) and lips (mine) still visible now in his 23-year-old face.There are other things you can’t see that I love about it too. My mother and father – long separated but still close – had raced each other in deadly earnest down the corridor and across the ward to get to our bedside first and meet their first grandchild; she won, of course. That makes me laugh, but also makes me feel fiercely loved. I also can’t quite see, but absolutely remember, the full body relief I felt when she arrived. I had an easy birth, but it was followed by a rough, restless night in a ward full of babies who tag-teamed their screaming. I recall staggering, leaking alarmingly, to the loo, and alternating between trying to feed this angry, hairy enigma and haggardly eyeballing a lifetime of responsibility in the odd moments he slept. Then there she was: the cavalry. This picture marks probably the first moment I fully exhaled in 12 hours.I love the way we’re both looking, together, at this astonishing new arrival, like he’s a shared endeavour we’re undertaking. And he was: she was there for me and my partner constantly for the first year of Theo’s life, holding me up when I couldn’t cope (often – I’ve never cried so much) and celebrating when I could, spending hours on the phone to me when she wasn’t spending nights in the crappy spare bed in our flat. She changed trains, missed meetings and made excuses to stick around, even though, as that outfit hints, she had a big, serious job directing a research unit. She took the minor baby wrangling setbacks that felt like life and death to me (he won’t eat! He won’t sleep! He’s got a rash!) and reframed them as low-stakes shared puzzles to be tirelessly chatted through. In another one of my favourite pictures, sitting in my eyeline by my desk, she’s in her dressing gown after staying over, with a beaming Theo, maybe six months old, on her knee. She looks completely content: she enjoyed him intensely and helped me enjoy him too. With her around, I learned to see him as he was – a funny, delightful mystery and entirely himself.My absolute favourite thing about this picture, though, is her arm around my shoulder. She died 18 months later; I still feel that arm, every day.Explore more on these topicsFamilyMy favourite family photoChildbirthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.The UK weather doesn’t always play ball, though, so for those who don’t want a dire forecast to result in a missed workout, indoor training replicates the exercise (if not the fresh air).The best exercise bikes are not only fantastic for burning a few calories without donning all the outdoor gear, but they can also help you nail training goals if you’re a more serious rider. With many letting you connect your phone or laptop to make the most of online training tools, it’s never been easier or more enjoyable to work out from your home.I tested 12 exercise bikes, including the sort you might find in a commercial gym, along with more dedicated riding simulators and recumbent models for those who find it tricky to sit hunched forward for any length of time. The resulting list features those that I think performed best.While I’ve tried to appeal to a wide range of budgets, it’s difficult to recommend much under the £500 mark because the build quality of these cheaper models is often not worth the investment.At a glanceBest exercise bike overall:Peloton Bike+£1,899 at One PelotonBest budget exercise bike for beginners:Horizon 3.0SC indoor cycle£569.99 at Johnson FitnessBest compact exercise bike:Wattbike Proton£1,575 at WattbikeBest gym-quality exercise bike:Technogym bike£3,620 at TechnogymBest recumbent exercise bike:LifeFitness RS3 LifeCycle£2,095 at John LewisWhy you should trust meWhile I no longer compete in official cycling events, I still consider myself a keen cyclist, often heading out with friends on a gravel bike, even if those rides now end in a warm pub, rather than a timed finish line. But when the weather isn’t playing ball, I’ll get stuck into a home- or gym-based exercise bike session to keep fit and stay in shape for when cycling season comes back around again.Having tested exercise equipment for numerous publications, I’m always one to get stuck in and test a product for as long as possible. With exercise bikes, this meant getting plenty of hands-on experience, no matter how sweaty it made me.How I testedView image in fullscreenWheels on fire: some bikes were tested in dedicated workout spaces.Photograph: Leon Poultney/The GuardianExercise bikes are bulky items that typically require an element of setup or construction. To make testing so many of them viable, I either borrowed a pre-assembled machine for one or two weeks or tested the bikes in a dedicated boutique or workout space.During each test, I used any workout modes that were available, syncing a smartphone or laptop to take advantage of third-party software or online classes, if these were offered. The machines were judged on their build quality, features, ease of setup and storage (some companies offer premium white glove deliveries), as well as the overall adjustability or suitability for numerous members of the household.After slipping into a pair of fetching cycling shoes, I assessed noise levels with a smartphone-based decibel meter, and made more subjective assessments on the general ride feel, comfort and the overall quality of the workout experience.The best exercise bikes in 2026View image in fullscreen‘Unmatched when it comes to live and on-demand classes’: the Peloton Bike+.Photograph: Leon Poultney/The GuardianBest exercise bike overall:Peloton Bike+PelotonBike+from£1,899£1,899 at Peloton£1,899 at John LewisWhat we loveA wide range of engaging workouts that somehow feel funWhat we don’t loveThe monthly subscription cost is hard to swallow, given the initial outlayPhotograph: Leon Poultney/The Guardian£1,899 at Peloton£1,899 at John LewisMany rivals have attempted to imitate Peloton, but few have managed to nail its overall experience. Above all, the brand is unmatched when it comes to live and on-demand classes, offering so many options – from a quick 15-minute spin class to hardcore sportive training, and all led by motivating instructors and accompanied by thumping soundtracks.The Bike+ is the premium one of the brand’s two exercise bikes and has a 23.8in (huge!) high-definition display, which can be rotated for workouts that involve movements off the machine. There’s also an automatic resistance knob that adjusts to match the levels recommended by instructors during classes.It’s expensive, with a £45-a-month “all access” membership fee on top, but for engaging, interactive workouts pitched at a wide range of users, nothing else comes close.Why we love itAlthough the Bike+ isn’t as aesthetically pleasing as some of its rivals, it’s comfortable, easy to adjust and not too imposing in any room. It also has wheels, so it is relatively easy to tip on its end and move around.The touchscreen on the Bike+ is of excellent quality and the sound from its built-in speakers is impressive, but it’s the array of classes that makes Peloton so alluring. Unlike many rivals, which can feel prescribed, mundane and overly technical, Peloton somehow makes a gruelling 45-minute spin session feel enjoyable.The weighted flywheel and belt-drive system are quiet enough to not disturb others in the household, although hardcore road cyclists will probably balk at the Bike+ for its lack of cycling realism and the bouncy, frenetic spin-class nature of many of its workouts.It doesn’t play nicely with third-party cycling apps – such as Zwift, Rouvy and TrainerRoad – either, so, if that’s important to you, look at the Wattbike Proton below instead.It’s a shame that …it doesn’t feel as realistic as some rivals, and there’s a monthly fee to access the classes and featuresDimensions:56 x 137 x 152cm (WLH)Weight:65kgDrivetrain:belt-drive with magnetic, digital resistance adjustmentSimulated grade:N/AConnectivity:Bluetooth 5, ANT+, wifi (2.4GHz and 5GHz)Folding:noNoise level:about 30dBMaximum user weight:135kgBuilt-in entertainment:yes, 23.8in rotating HD touchscreen with Peloton classes, Netflix, Disney+ and morePelotonBike+from£1,899£1,899 at Peloton£1,899 at John LewisWhat we loveA wide range of engaging workouts that somehow feel funWhat we don’t loveThe monthly subscription cost is hard to swallow, given the initial outlayBest budget exercise bike for beginners:Horizon 3.0SC Indoor CycleHorizon3.0SC Indoor Cyclefrom£569.99£569.99 at Johnson Fitness£569.99 at AmazonWhat we loveWell built and capable, despite the low cost of entryWhat we don’t loveLimited built-in workouts, and you’ll need your own screenPhotograph: Leon Poultney/The Guardian£569.99 at Johnson Fitness£569.99 at AmazonAt the time of writing, the Horizon 3.0SC Indoor Cycle cost £569.99, making it one of the cheapest exercise bikes I tested. But it certainly doesn’t feel cheap or any less capable than many of the other exercise bikes I poured sweat upon.The 3.0SC has an ultra-smooth, front-mounted flywheel that uses electronically adjustable magnetic resistance to provide 32 effort levels. All of this is controlled via a funky and futuristic-looking digital dial that responds quickly to inputs – great for jumping out of the saddle during high-intensity efforts.Although this is predominantly designed for use in spin classes, its ergonomically cushioned seat and easy-adjust handlebars make it a comfortable spot to pedal away the hours. Oh, and it’s whisper-quiet too, registering just 32dBduring my testing.It may not be the sort of thing I’d use to train for an upcoming cycling sportive, but it’s a well-priced tool for hitting daily fitness goals.Why we love itThe 3.0SC looks great. It even blasts out eight vibrant colours from its flywheel, depending on the RPM and amount of effort you are putting in, adding a bit of Tron-like sci-fi to any room.And aside from its relatively compact proportions and lightweight build, the bike is also well connected, playing nicely with Zwift, Kinomap and other third-party fitness apps. There are more realistic-feeling bikes out there, but if you swap out the pedals for a dedicated clipless system, it’s a fairly convincing road bike. Space between the cranks, for example, is as narrow as possible, making it ride like a genuine road machine.If you’re looking for on-demand fitness classes, you can find these via Horizon’s freeatZoneworkout app. Pair your phone or tablet with the bike, mount it to the secure plastic holder at the front of the bars, and you’re good to go. For a free service, there’s an impressive amount of content, and it’ll track your progress over time.It’s a shame that…there isn’t an integrated display, meaning you’ll have to bring a tablet or smartphone for any instructor-led workouts.Dimensions: 52 x 107 x 120cm (WLH)Weight:36kgDrivetrain: belt drive with ECB (eddy current) magnetic, electronic resistance (32 levels)Simulated grade:N/AConnectivity:Bluetooth 5 (FTMS compatible for app integration)Folding:no (but features transport wheels)Noise level:about 32dBMaximum user weight:100kgBuilt-in entertainment:no built-in screen; includes tablet holder and syncs with training appsHorizon3.0SC Indoor Cyclefrom£569.99£569.99 at Johnson Fitness£569.99 at AmazonWhat we loveWell built and capable, despite the low cost of entryWhat we don’t loveLimited built-in workouts, and you’ll need your own screenBest compact exercise bike:Wattbike ProtonWattbikeProtonfrom£1,575£1,575 at Wattbike£1,795 at DecathlonWhat we loveA realistic feel and easily customisable between family membersWhat we don’t loveYou’ll need to bring your own video entertainment/inspiration£1,575 at Wattbike£1,795 at DecathlonWattbike is probably best known for its original red, white and blackAir bikemachines, which can be found in gyms and health clubs up and down the country. The company has since ventured into home-workout territory, and the Proton sits somewhere in the middle of its range, offering a lightweight, compact footprint and support for popular third-party training apps, including Zwift and TrainingPeaks.Racy looks and confusing workout programmes may risk putting off more casual users, but the Proton is designed to appeal to all of the family – comfortably adjusting for those between 4ft 6in and 6ft 6in tall. It’s not as quiet as some of its rivals, but the Proton feels realistic to ride and even has an auto-adjusting ergometer mode (ERG), so it can simulate gradients and gear changes without you having to lift a finger.Why we love itWattbike has done an admirable job in retaining a realistic bike feel on such a lightweight and compact machine, with a fully adjustable seat post, saddle and handlebars that make it easy to set up to your requirements. I was able to quickly swap the standard toe-cage pedals for someShimano clipless ones,which improved my performance and gave me greater control over pedal stroke. Most exercise bikes will allow you to swap the pedals, which takes about five minutes if you have the correct spanner or hex key. Adding cleats and pedals allows you to don a dedicated cycling shoe, which provides better power transfer between the legs and pedals compared with basic adjustable toe cages.Wattbike’s background in working with pro athletes is evident from the Wattbike Hub app, which offers real-time feedback on pedal stroke and efficiency, among other nerdy data fields. The app has been tweaked to appeal to the more casual fitness fanatic, but it’s far from friendly to beginners, and you won’t find the same interactivity you would with a Peloton class. It’s more a case of following graphs and on-screen warnings about form than watching live demos from a bubbly personal trainer.However, there are still plenty of workouts aimed at improving overall health rather than targeting highly trained athletes. And, if you like, you can always mount your iPad in the dedicated holder and binge television or complete a virtual workout session of your choice: the Proton’s Bluetooth FTMS technology means it will work with most third-party apps,such as Zwift, TrainerRoad and Rouvy.It’s a shame that …the app isn’t slicker and with more to entice and retain a novice.Dimensions:57 x 102 x 127cm (WLH)Weight:48kgDrivetrain:chain drive with electromagnetic resistanceMaximum power output:1,800WSimulated grade:up to +25% inclineConnectivity:ANT+ FE-C, Bluetooth (FTMS compatible for app integration)Folding:no; includes front transport wheels for ease of movementNoise level:about 40dBMaximum user weight:135kgBuilt-in entertainment: no built-in screen; includes tablet holderWattbikeProtonfrom£1,575£1,575 at Wattbike£1,795 at DecathlonWhat we loveA realistic feel and easily customisable between family membersWhat we don’t loveYou’ll need to bring your own video entertainment/inspirationBest gym-quality exercise bike:Technogym BikeTechnogymBike£3,620£3,620 at TechnogymWhat we loveA superb performer with wide support and built-in appsWhat we don’t loveIt costs a fortune upfront, plus the subscription costPhotograph: Leon Poultney/The Guardian£3,620 at TechnogymTechnogym has been steadily raising the bar when it comes to smart fitness equipment, with a growing line of connected kit that aims to bring the personal trainer experience to your own home.Clearly designed to take on the likes of Peloton, the Technogym Bike is a stylish machine with a 22in high-definition touchscreen that allows access to a raft of Technogym’s live and on-demand content.Its compact, svelte frame looks and feels as if it’s aimed at more serious cyclists than Peloton’s offering, and the ride experience is smoother and slightly more natural than its rival. There’s plenty of adjustability for different-size riders, while the included double-sided pedals allow for use with trainers or SPD cycling shoes (a clipless shoe system).The built-in screen is crisp and easy to navigate, granting access to entertainment apps, including YouTube and Netflix. It rotates to allow for off-bike sessions, too. However, it’s among the most expensive models I tested, and there’s a furthermembership fee, starting at £8.99 a month. Ouch.Why we love itThe riding experience is comfortable without straying too far from a realistic simulation, while the powerful flywheel offers punishing levels of resistance. Technogym has live classes, as with Peloton, but it also appeals to the more hardcore athlete with dedicated training programmes geared towards those with ambitions of tackling the Col de Turini.If you’re seeking the best in terms of design and build quality – and your bank balance permits the luxury – you’ll be happy with this bike. It’s a handsome, well-built machine that straddles the line between a dedicated cycling trainer and a spin bike well.It also works with most third-party training apps and syncs up neatly with Apple Fitness and Apple Watch via a quick-tap NFC panel. For those totally dedicated to Lycra,Technogym offers an even more expensive Ride model, which feels built to compete with Wattbike and Wahoo’s most serious offerings.It’s a shame that …it costs so much, and then Technogym charges yet more for a monthly membership.Dimensions:59 x 121 x 138cm (WLH)Weight:67kgDrivetrain:belt drive with magnetic resistance (20 levels)Simulated grade:not specifiedConnectivity:supports streaming via external device (eg Chromecast, Fire TV Stick); Apple Watch pairing; Technogym Live integration and third-party appsFolding:noNoise level:about 30dBMaximum user weight:160kgBuilt-in entertainment:yes, rotating display with ability to stream apps (TV shows, movies, games, etc) via smartphone, tablet or laptopTechnogymBike£3,620£3,620 at TechnogymWhat we loveA superb performer with wide support and built-in appsWhat we don’t loveIt costs a fortune upfront, plus the subscription costBest recumbent exercise bike:LifeFitness RS3 LifeCycleLifeFitnessRS3 LifeCyclefrom£2,095£2,095 at John Lewis£2,295 at FitshopWhat we loveComfortable and ergonomic for those who need a more relaxed workoutWhat we don’t loveThe console is tricky to use, and there’s no built-in multimedia£2,095 at John Lewis£2,295 at FitshopRecumbent bikes are great for those who experience back pain, struggle with past injuries or simply find it daunting or uncomfortable to be perched atop a traditional exercise bike for any length of time. You can achieve the same, low-impact cardio workout while enjoying a more relaxed seating position that takes the pressure off the lower back, leg joints and neck.LifeFitness is a reputable brand that supplies commercial gym equipment and kit more suited for use at home, with the RS3 sitting between the two. For the money, you get a comfortable, ergonomically fitted seat with backrest, 20 levels of resistance and a step-through design that makes it easy to get on and off. There’s also plenty of adjustment in the seat to get the perfect workout position.Although larger than many more traditional exercise bikes, it can be lifted and moved because of its transport wheels.Why we love itMore seasoned riders will probably find a recumbent bike a little too laidback, since it’s difficult to transfer maximum power through the cranks from the more relaxed seating position. That said, it’s not really designed for smashing PBs – it’s best placed for longer, low-intensity steady-state cardio sessions.It links to Rouvy, Zwift and a bunch of other third-party fitness apps, but the digital offering is otherwise basic, with a handful of built-in and customisable workouts direct from the console. Users can also pair an Apple or Samsung Galaxy Watch for heart-rate tracking and more.Some recumbent bikes can feel decidedly budget, but that’s not the case here.

Heck, the bike even simulates several electronically assisted gearing group sets from Shimano and Campagnolo, mimicking the way the cogs feel when shifting under load.It’s a wonderfully quiet, smooth and powerful machine that works perfectly with dedicated cycling training apps.

It has a comfy padded seat, oversized self-balancing pedals and a unique handlebar design that allows for multiple hand positions. Despite the upright positioning, the ride feel is realistic, and there are 30 levels of resistance to contend with.It’s expensive, given that the XUR digital console isn’t as goodas those from Technogym, Peloton and NordicTrack, but this is a solid, reliable and comfortable bit of kit from one of the biggest names in commercial gym equipment.It didn’t make the final cut because …it’s an expensive bike with a less impressive digital offering than cheaper rivals.Dimensions:63 x 122 x 143cm (WLH);weight:60kg;drivetrain:Exact Force induction brake (electronically adjustable resistance);simulated grade:N/A;connectivity:wifi (entertainment apps, software updates), Bluetooth (FTMS compatible for app integration, HR monitor, headphones), HDMI port, USB (media and charging);folding:no, includes transport wheels;noise level:about 28dB;maximum user weight:159kg;built-in entertainment:yes, 22in HD touchscreen with apps including Netflix, YouTube and Spotify, web browser, social media, plus tablet/HDMI mirroringMatrixU50£3,779£3,779 at Johnson FitnessWhat we loveIncredibly realistic feel and great build qualityWhat we don’t lovePricey, considering its digital offering is a little weakWhat you need to knowView image in fullscreenLook for a connected bike with an integrated screen and app compatibility if you want to be entertained while riding.Photograph: Leon Poultney/The GuardianHow much should I spend?Exercise bikes vary wildly in price, with the cheapest models often taking the form of basic upright or spin bikes that focus purely on pedalling, and the most expensive offering large HD touchscreens, automatic resistance adjustments and fully integrated training platforms.Budget models typically start at £250-£400, but often lack the build quality and adjustability needed for long-term use. At the other end of the spectrum, premium connected bikes – such as those from Peloton, Technogym and NordicTrack – can set you back £2,000 or more, and often require monthly subscriptions on top for interactive classes.For most riders, a budget of between £600 and £1,200 is a good place to start for solid build quality, smooth resistance and decent connectivity features without straying into commercial-gym territory.How much room do you need?Even the most compact exercise bikes take up space, with the smallest options measuring about 55 x 120 x 130cm (WLH). While that’s less floor space than atreadmillorcross trainer, you’ll still need clearance around the bike for safe mounting and dismounting, as well as enough ceiling height to remain comfortable when standing on the pedals.Recumbent bikes, which offer a chair-like riding position, often require more floor space, while upright and indoor cycles are more compact. It might be tempting to look at folding exercise bikes, but they can often be flimsy and offer weak pedal resistance.What features should I lookfor?The most important thing is the resistance system: magnetic resistance is smoother, quieter and requires less maintenance than older friction-based systems found on traditional studio spin bikes. Belt-drive systems are also preferable to chain-driven units for their silent, low-maintenance operation.Adjustability is another key factor – a bike with multiple saddle and handlebar positions will ensure better ergonomics and comfort over long sessions, and it will also fit more members of the household.For those who want to stay entertained, connected bikes with integrated screens and app compatibility (Zwift, Peloton, iFit, etc) can make training more engaging. Heart-rate monitoring and Bluetooth/ANT+ connectivity are also useful for tracking progress.Finally, noise levels are worth considering, especially if you live in a flat or plan to exercise when everyone else is sleeping. Modern magnetic systems are whisper-quiet, making them perfect for shared living spaces.Leon Poultney has been a consumer technology and automotive journalist for longer than he cares to divulge.

The filling makes good use of any dried fruit lingering still from Christmas, and is brightened with lemon and bound with nutty tahini. As the apples bake, they turn yielding and fragrant, while the sesame oat topping crisps to a golden crown. Serve warm with a splash of cream, yoghurt or ice-cream (dairy or otherwise), and you have comfort that feels wholesome and indulgent.Baked apples with lemon and tahiniIf need be, you can make these vegan and/or dairy-free with a few simple tweaks.Prep5 minCook1 hr 15 minServes63 largegrannysmith apples200ml apple juiceDouble cream, yoghurt or vanilla ice-cream(dairy or otherwise), to serveFor the filling70g dried fruit(any combination of raisins, figs, apricots, dates), cut into roughly the size of raisins25g shelled pecans, chopped25g light or dark brown sugar30g tahini½ tsp ground cinnamonFinely grated zest of 1 small lemon1tbsp lemon juice⅛ tsp flaky sea saltFor the oat and sesame crisp25g oats15g sesame seeds1tbspolive oil, or melted coconut oil1tbsp maple syrup⅛ tsp flaky sea saltCut the apples in half and, using a teaspoon, scoop out the cores to make a cavity about 3cm wide. Arrange the apples cut side up in a snug-fitting baking dish, then pour over half the apple juice, allowing the excess to pool around the base of the fruit.Heat the oven to 210C (190C fan)/410F/gas 6½. To make the filling, mix all the ingredients in a small bowl and toss until evenly combined. Spoon about a tablespoon of filling into each apple cavity, gently pressing it in to help it stick. Cover the dish with tinfoil, then bake for 30 minutes.Meanwhile, mix all the oat and sesame crisp ingredients in a small bowl.After the 30 minutes are up, remove the foil cover and spoon the sesame mixture over the apples. Pour the remaining apple juice into the base of the dish, then turn down the oven to 200C (180C fan)/350F/gas 4 and return the dish uncovered to the oven for another 30 minutes, or until the apples are tender and the topping is golden. If the topping browns too quickly, loosely cover again with the foil.Remove the apples from the oven, leave to cool slightly, then serve with cream, yoghurt or vanilla ice-cream.Explore more on these topicsFoodThe sweet spotDessertFruitWinter food and drinkBakingVegan food and drinkVegetarian food and drinkrecipesShareReuse this content"

Sign up hereChloe Mac DonnellFri 9 Jan 2026 02.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 9 Jan 2026 02.05 ESTShareFor more than 25 years, Pantone, which describes itself as “the global authority for colour communication and inspiration”, has attempted to prophesy the year ahead by choosing its specific colour.For 2026, it is hedging its bets on something calledcloud dancer.While it’s highly unlikely that the next 12 months can be neatly summarised by one colour before the year has even kicked off (Pantone’s announcement took place in December), it still garners headlines because, in a way, Pantone’s decision does reflect on some level what is happening in the zeitgeist – or, at least, what is expected to happen. After the economic crash in 2009 camemimosa, a “warm and engaging” shade of yellow said to represent hope and optimism (it rang true with a mimosa-coloured sofa becoming a must-have and everyone taking up daily affirmations). In 2016, there was the blending ofserenity and rose quartz– AKA the ubiquitous millennial pink – while last year’smocha mousseis the reason you are seeing brown everywhere.Pantone describes cloud dancer as “a billowy white imbued with serenity”, which serves as “a symbol of calming influence in a society rediscovering the value of quiet reflection”. It’s basically white, but not Hollywood veneer white. A sort of off-white. If you follow Molly-Mae Hague, or any other influencer with a home that resembles a clinical setting, you’ll already be familiar with it. Yet, against a background of rising white nationalism and theculling of diversity, equity and inclusion programmes in the US and UK– not to mention vibrant colours making a massive comeback on the catwalks after the death of quiet luxury–critics quickly called it “Pantone-deaf”. In an interview withthe Washington Post, Pantone’s vice-president, Laurie Pressman, defended the choice, saying: “Skin tones did not factor into this.” This only further fuelled division with a flurry of pieces on “wokeism”.Nonetheless, Pantone is standing firm behind its decision, launching collaborations with Motorola, Post-it, and evenPlay-Doh.So, what does it all mean, and why now? Here, three colour experts and cultural commentators weigh in.‘It feels like a eugenics-y move’Nicole Ocran, writer, podcaster and co-author ofThe Half of It – Exploring the Mixed Race Experience“There’s been so much around the clean-girl aesthetic, quiet luxury, tradwives and the idea of purity, that my immediate reaction when I saw the announcement was, ‘Whoa, this feels very deliberate.’ I couldn’t help but think of theSydney Sweeney jeans campaign. It feels like a eugenics-y move. It’s impossible to separate politics from fashion.“There is a pushback against ‘wokeism’ and the idea of, ‘Oh, it’s just a colour, there’s nothing more to it.’ But Pantone are trend forecasting. So to say they didn’t look into it deeper is strange. They assign meaning to things that feel frivolous.“The name suggests you are up in the clouds with not a care in the world. Again, this really lends itself to a particular type of person who can feel that way. I would totally love to just vibe out and not have to worry about anything. But given the way things are moving, it’s really scary and it’s really concerning.“We’re all being told that we need to look a very specific way and that this specific style is the most aesthetically pleasing. For me, it feels like a stripping back of any individuality. And that’s really depressing to think about.”‘Itdoesn’t bring anything new’Paddy O’Donnell, international brand ambassador forFarrow & Ball,and freelance interior consultant“Our bestselling paints are always white, so it’s a bit of a non-story. Most people default to using white when decorating. It’s their comfort zone, as they are terrified of using colour. If you spoke to any other paint manufacturer, they’d probably all say their bestselling colours are off-whites. So it kind of doesn’t bring anything new to our discussion.“Cloud dancer is not awhitewhite, it’s a nuanced white. If we were looking for an equivalent on the Farrow & Ball colour card, it would sit somewhere between strong white and ammonite – it’s warmish, rather than anything too sharp and too clean. It’s a really good white, a really useful white for trims and ceilings.“[Trend-wise] I’m seeing a huge surge towards lilacs. The idea is really terrifying, but think of it like a bunch of Dutch pink tulips. It’s a slightly sharp, pale terracotta, which leans towards apricot and blush. We’ve had loads of chestnuts and tobaccos, too. I love a dark cacao brown, and a dark cacao brown in full gloss is so sexy. Brown is the best neutral in the world because every colour family works with it. Be careful with yellows, because it goes into banana territory, but pinks work with it, reds work with it, blues work with it, greens work with it. It’s just unbelievably chic.”View image in fullscreenThe white stuff … the world as seen in cloud dancer.Photograph: Pantone‘A white supremacist dog-whistle’Gabrielle Minoli, writer and content creator@saltlacroix“We’ve clocked cloud dancer as a white supremacist dog-whistle, and none of these descriptors do anything to help their case. Every justification has sounded more loaded than the next. If anything, I was a bit surprised by the name and how flippant it sounds. The concept of ‘cloud dancing’ is very unserious, but I suppose it reflects how we’re more comfortable dancing around pressing societal issues and ‘isms’ or ignoring them, rather than facing them head-on.“It reminds me of two-ply toilet paper – three-ply if we’re being generous. It’s the uncanny veneers of a Fox News broadcaster. It’s the threatening silence of a suburb that has driven out anyone with a skin tone deeper than beige.“Curiously, Pantone’s positioning of cloud dancer also reads as a nod to generative AI. They’ve called it a blank slate, and a shade that ‘opens the door to increased imagination and innovation’. This is eerily similar to language used to persuade us to buy into AI tools that actually chip away at our creativity and critical thinking. In that way, cloud dancer reminds me of out of touch big tech executives ready to wipe their own slate clean of pesky human employees and the burden of paying them.”‘It’s incredibly neutral’Jules Standish,colour consultant and author ofHow Not to Wear Black“When I am working with a client, I will always talk about white at the end of their analysis once I know whether they’ve got a golden or a blue base – whether they are warm or cool.“Cloud dancer is neither warm nor cool, so it’s incredibly neutral. It’s very hard in colour analysis to find a colour that is entirely neutral, particularly when you’re looking at shades of white.“If I had to say one season it is going to look best on, it would probably be summer. A brilliant white looks fantastic on winters as they have cool tones. For autumns or spring, I would suggest ivory creams and buttery whites.“The thing about white in colour analysis is if it’s the wrong shade for you, it can make you look like you’re in a hospital bed. Even if you have a warm skin tone, a brilliant white can make the skin look very ashy and very blotchy. I often say to people, if you want a sick day at work, if a bright white is not in your season, wear it and someone will look at you and go, ‘Please don’t come in today.’”To read the complete version of this newsletter – complete with this week’s trending topics in The Measure and your wardrobe dilemmas solved –subscribe to receive Fashion Statementin your inbox every Thursday.Explore more on these topicsFashionFashion Statement newsletterDesignnewslettersShareReuse this content"

I was getting stuck into a dumpling cooking class in one of the most vegan-friendly cities in the world. Makinggyozain Tokyo, perhaps? Wontons in Singapore? Potstickers in Taipei?In fact, I was preparingpierogiin Warsaw. Friends who associate Polish cuisine with stews and sausages were surprised to hear it, but vegan food has proliferated across the country over the past 20 years. Happy Cow, the veteran vegan restaurant guide, now consistentlyranks Warsaw in its top cities globally– last year it was in 11th place, ahead of Bangkok, San Francisco and Copenhagen.Poland may be best known for its meat dishes, but fungi and vegetables such as potatoes, cabbage, beetroot and cucumbers have long been central to its food culture. Agnieszka Skrodzka, a Warsaw tour guide specialising in plant-based food, says it is far easier to avoid meat than mushrooms – as she found out when she recently developed a mushroom allergy. As Karol Adamiak, a chef from Warsaw,wrote in the Guardian last year: “Veganism represents a return to Poland’s peasant roots, and a more conscious and healthy way of eating.”I was inspired to visit Poland after I wrote aboutholidaying as a veganlast summer, and several readers recommended the country. One sang the praises of Gdańsk, and I was also tempted by Kraków, but Happy Cow’sfindingswere hard to argue with: Warsaw has an impressive 34 vegan restaurants, rising to 80 if you include vegetarian restaurants with vegan options, and another 200-odd “vegan-friendly” places.View image in fullscreenPeerless pierogi, the dumpling that is emblematic of Polish cuisineChallenge accepted: my sister and I set about eating as much as humanly possible in three days. We started with vegan versions of traditional Polish dishes, including huge plates of pierogi with spinach and tofu (£7) and potato pancakes with crispy oyster mushrooms (£8) atVege Miasto, the oldest vegan restaurant in the city. Comfort food such as soy schnitzel with mash and beetroot (£8) atVeganda, and Silesian potato dumplings with soy meat, gravy and fried onions (£8) atLokal Vegan Bistro, helped us cope with the bitter cold of a Warsaw winter.Then we went global. First, a colourful meze platter for two (£17.50) atFalla, a Middle Eastern-inspired restaurant that also has branches in Gdynia, Poznań, Wrocław and Katowice. Next, brimming bowls of noodle soup (£10) atVegan Ramen Shop, which has three outlets across the city. Our favourite variety was the tan-tan men: a creamy, spicy broth made from tahini, chilli oil, black vinegar and Sichuan peppercorns. We also scoffed a mound of spaghetti “carbonara” with vegan bacon and artichokes (£8) at Lokal, and a classic crispy tofu burger (£9) at Veganda. Finally, we squeezed in brunch atBistro Jaskółka– I sampledshakshukawith tofu scramble and my sister heroically worked her way through the fry-up (both about £7).There were many other highly recommended restaurants we simply couldn’t fit in, either due to our schedule or our bellies – I was particularly disappointed not to try a platter of plant-based sushi atVegan Sushi Bar.Even our hotel,Puro Stare Miasto, had three vegan dishes on the à la carte breakfast menu; I loved the porridge with forest fruit compote, olive oil and herbs.

We visited somerevitalised former industrial spaces, such as theNorblin Factoryand theWarsaw Brewery, now full of cafes, restaurants and shops. At theMuseum of Modern Art, we saw a fascinating exhibition called The Woman Question, featuring 150 female artists from Artemisia Gentileschi to Cindy Sherman (until 3 May).And, of course, we learned to make our own pierogi.Pierogi & Moreruns cooking classes that cater to all; our group consisted of us two vegans, three vegetarians and five meat-eaters. We all made a simple flour and water dough, then added our own fillings: the vegan ones contained mashed potato and beans, and chickpeas and lentils, with various herbs and spices. The most challenging part, and the most satisfying, was attempting different ways of sealing and folding them. We started with classic half-moons with crimped edges, and moved on to more complex shapes, such as mini cornish pasties with a pleated “crust”, and ring-shaped tortellini.A train tour of Europe’s cool northern capitals: from London to Vilnius, via Berlin and WarsawRead moreThe only potential downside was the communal taste-test afterwards: as every vegan knows, everyone wants to try yours, but you can’t try theirs. In our case, it was for the best: this was just elevenses and we had lunch scheduled afterwards. The couple of pierogi I did gulp down, topped with slow-cooked onions, were delicious.Is Warsaw really one of the most vegan-friendly cities in the world? In my brief experience, yes – and I live in the top-ranked city (London) and have visited seven ofthe top 10. The food is also far more affordable than in most of the other highly rated cities.By the end of our vegan eating odyssey, much like the dumplings, we were stuffed. But in for a penny … We grabbed a takeout box of pastries fromBaja, a vegan patisserie, to sustain us on the journey home. It turns out there’s always room for a Lotus Biscoff doughnut.The trip was provided by theWarsaw Tourism Office.

Synaesthesia has given me an extraordinary ability for languagesKim Elms, a speech pathologist, shares her experience as an auditory-visual synaestheteRead more stories of synaesthesia inthe way I feelseriesAs told toKatie StrickFri 9 Jan 2026 09.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 9 Jan 2026 21.11 ESTShareCar journeys with my partner are a nightmare. He’s an ex-DJ so he likes to crank the music up, but for me this means seeing static images and flashes of light in my mind’s eye while I’m trying to drive. It’s hard to describe exactly what I see when I hear sound. But it’s almost like the sound waves you’d see if you watched an audio recording on a screen, or these little neurons connecting and space nebulas exploding in front of me.I’m 44 now and only realised I had auditory-visual synaesthesia in my 30s. What I did know was that I seemed to have an extraordinary ability for linguistics. In school I studied Japanese and did really well without trying because I could literally see the words and sounds presented as images in front of me, making them easy to remember. At university I majored in Spanish, Korean and Indonesian and it was no effort at all. I then joined the air force as an intelligence officer because I didn’t want to become a teacher or translator. I walked away from the language aptitude test thinking I’d either messed it up or that it had been the easiest thing I’d ever done in my life. No one’s ever managed to get every answer right, they said when the results came back. But I hadn’t even tried. It just came naturally.I taste words. ‘Bob’ is like a milk chocolate Easter egg on my tongueRead moreThe first time I heard the word synaesthesia was when I decided to work in speech pathology after leaving the military. I started learning about autism spectrum disorder and various forms of neurodivergence, and read about this phenomenon called synaesthesia, in which stimulation of one sense leads to automatic experiences in a second sense. I didn’t make any connection to my own experiences but began reading a book about a man who could learn languages in a matter of hours. Still, I didn’t make the connection. I just thought it was interesting.It wasn’t until I started doing speech-to-text computational linguistic work that I started really thinking about the fact that I was seeing these shapes when I heard sounds or phonemes. I found a Facebook group full of people who saw sounds too, though they all saw sounds as colours whereas mine are all black and white shapes. The only time I see colour is when I hear high-frequency sounds, which start as bright white then move through the scale of yellows to oranges to reds. I’ve always been able to pass hearing tests at ridiculously quiet decibels because I see the pure tones as different coloured flashes.View image in fullscreen‘My brain feels busy pretty much constantly thanks to the noisy world we live in.’Photograph: Blake Sharp-Wiggins/The GuardianOne day I was working as an assistant transcribing Indigenous creole languages for Wollongong University when my supervisor put me in touch with the head linguist for Apple. She was looking for someone really good with phonetics, who would be free to go to Japan for 90 days to work on a new speech-to-text project. On day one of the job I found out I’d been chosen to work on Siri.I spent a lot of time in headphones over those next 90 days, as they recorded Australian voices and I sat in. I loved it and I’ve loved pretty much every work-day since. I’ve done speech-to-text projects for Tom Tom GPS and Bank of America, and a lot of my day-to-day work now is as a speech pathologist, helping children and adults to communicate and swallow better.I’m not worried about the rise of AI because language is incredibly nuanced and robots simply aren’t good enough to pick up those subtleties. I can break down thewestern Sydney Lebanese accentin an instant. I wouldn’t trust AI to do it.My form of synaesthesia comes with its challenges. I wear a lot of earplugs to block out the sound around me, and my brain feels busy pretty much constantly thanks to the noisy world we live in. Running to music is my favourite way to switch off. It’s the only time I don’t see sound and my brain is quiet.All of that said, I wouldn’t change my synaesthesia for a second. I could lose my sight and cut my arms off, but if I couldn’t work with words and sounds it would destroy me. I feel so lucky that I found this field of work when I did, and I’ll keep going until I’m 80 if I can. It feels like my reason for being – myikigai, they call it in Japanese. I’d do it for free if I didn’t have bills to pay.Anina Rich, a cognitive neuroscientist and chair ofthe Synaesthesia Research Group at Macquarie University, assisted in reporting this seriesExplore more on these topicsAustralian lifestyleThe way I feelPsychologyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I didn’t set out to dig graves for a living – it’s nobody’s childhood dream – but working as a contract gardener for the council in Oxfordshire, I did some work tending cemeteries, and eventually I was offered a job digging graves.I found it quite daunting at first. I was responsible for digging the plots and being on hand during the funeral service, as well as filling in the grave. It felt like a huge responsibility. I’d recently lost my nan and I’d sit and watch the funerals with a lump in my throat. From the beginning, I treated every grave as though it were for a member of my own family. For the first time, I felt like my job really mattered.I eventually set up my own business and was asked to take on gravedigging for a natural burial ground calledLeedam. It is made up of 40 acres of meadow and woodland. Instead of headstones, we plant trees, so the deceased can return to nature. It’s so peaceful and beautiful in every season. I understand why people want to spend eternity there.I feel truly lucky that I get to play such an important role at the end of somebody’s life. Sometimes I get to meet the family before a funeral and find out about the person who has died. I like to think of them when I’m digging their final resting place. It sounds cheesy, but I see it as putting them to bed for the last time. Most of the hole has to be dug by machine as the ground is hard, but I jump in and do the finishing touches by hand. I fill the bottom of the grave with freshly cut grass, or a bed of leaves, depending on the season, so it doesn’t look too stark.When my time comes, I want to be buried at the natural burial ground. I like the idea of my body fuelling the growth of a treeI’ve buried more than 1,000 people over the last 20 years. Some funerals are particularly memorable, such as the one for a Star Wars fan who had a troupe of actors dressed as stormtroopers leading his funeral procession. Another time, I helped a woman backfill the grave of her three-year-old son who had died suddenly. I didn’t think she would go through with it. But she told me, “I’ve looked after this little boy for three years; I can’t walk away now.” We talked about her son as we shovelled the dirt together. She’s probably the bravest person I’ve ever met.I’ve buried a friend, and one day I’ll bury my wonderful mum, too, although hopefully not any time soon. She says she wants to be buried in Leedam so she can keep an eye on me at work once she’s gone. I think about it from time to time, and how it will be devastating, but I’d never let anyone else do it. It’s a job I have to do myself.Last September, I was named gravedigger of the year at the Good Funeral awards. It’s actually the second time I’ve been awarded the title – the last time in 2014. I shed a little tear on both occasions. It’s so humbling to think you’ve made a difference to people in a job like this. Despite what some may think, the atmosphere at the awards ceremony is quite jovial; people who work in the funeral industry usually have a good sense of humour. We all care deeply about what we do, though, so it can get quite competitive.Experience: I stopped a man from crashing our planeRead moreWhen my time comes, I also want to be buried at the ground where I work. It sounds like the ultimate busman’s holiday, but I feel as though I am part of the history of the place, and I like the idea of my body fuelling the growth of a tree. I don’t want anyone to feel obliged to come and tend a concrete slab for me and leave a bunch of flowers wrapped in cellophane.When I tell people what I do for a living, they often say my job must make me morbid, but I think the opposite is true; I truly appreciate life. I’ve sat through enough funerals to know that plenty of people go to bed and don’t wake up the next day. Our time here is limited. I tell my loved ones that I love them every day, and try to live my life to the fullest. I’ve been bungee jumping and skydiving. The way I see it, we’re only here on this beautiful planet for a short visit, so I’m determined to make the most of it.As told to Heather MainDo you have an experience to share?

All but the evergreens are barren and bare. Yet there is an approach to year-round growing that, in the depths of winter, feels all the more miraculous. Microgreens are not a “type” of plant, but a method of growing leafy crops which doesn’t require much space or effort – and, importantly for now, can be done indoors – in order to achieve an unseasonably fresh burst of flavour on your dinner plate.Any plant that is edible from top-to-toe can be grown as a microgreen. From salad leaves like lettuce and sorrel to herbs such as basil, dill, coriander and fennel, plus all the brassicas from the very delicious mustard greens and rocket to the far less spicy broccoli and kale. Also on the fuller side of the flavour profile are nasturtiums and sunflowers, which produce juicy shoots with a nutty flavour. Peas also produce a substantial shoot with pretty leaves and tendrils. Amaranth, carrot and perilla are other edible plants I am eager to try.As you’re not expecting these crops to reach maturity, low light levels aren’t much of an issueMicrogreens are grown in containers, sown densely and harvested when young. As the intention is to eat the crop well before it needs space to reach its full size, lots of plants can be raised in modestly sized trays. In fact, recycled punnets work well. Add compost until your seed tray or punnet is two thirds full (although I’d be tempted to go a bit deeper for crops with larger seeds such as peas or sunflowers) and tamp down to create a firm but not compacted bed. Spread a generous single layer of seeds on to the compost and cover with a fine layer of compost no deeper than the size of the seed itself. In the case of tiny seeds such as amaranth this will only be a smattering. Water well using a can with a fine rose so you don’t disrupt all your careful work. Alternatively, you can cover your seeds with a wet piece of kitchen towel and they’ll germinate under there.Winter is the ideal time to give your gardening tools some TLC. Here’s my step-by-step guideRead moreThen place your trays somewhere bright – like a windowsill – and wait a couple of weeks while the seeds germinate and start to grow. As you’re not expecting these crops to reach maturity, low light levels aren’t much of an issue; even a leggy microgreen is worth eating. You can use grow lights if you have them.Harvest your microgreens with a very sharp pair of snips to avoid snagging and dragging these tiny plants and risking an addition of compost to your winter salad or sandwich. Most of the plants I’ve suggested above will provide a single harvest, but peas and nasturtiums should produce an extra flush or two if you allow them to continue to grow, then selectively pick the tips and leaves instead of cutting them off at the base.Explore more on these topicsGardening adviceGardensfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In 1961, there was snow cover on an average of 23 days a year at the institute’s weather station at De Bilt, near Utrecht; now, it is just three days a year.Wiebe Wieling is a former chair of theElfstedentocht(11 cities tour) Association, which tries to organise an outdoor ice skating race on natural ice across 11 Friesian cities if the ice is thick enough, something that has not happened since 1997.He said: “We just don’t have the winters that we had in the 20th century. It’s not only my frustration. It’s a Dutch frustration. It’s a climate frustration.”So when snow does come, like it did this week, some worry that Dutch people have forgotten how to cope with it.“Yesterday, I was walking along an important cycle route to various schools in Rotterdam,” an environmental consultant, Vincent Luyendijk, saidon social media, sharing photos of children forced into the middle of traffic. “I was blue in the face with frustration.”View image in fullscreenCyclists in the snow in Rotterdam.Photograph: ANP/ShutterstockThe national Fietsersbond cycling union is researching the situation after reports of “a lot of inconvenience” from snow-filled lanes in some areas. In Hilversum, some of the union’s members were livid.“We saw that bike lanes were in such a state that you really don’t dare to get on your bike,” a volunteer, Marjolein van Dillen,told Dutch media. “While the road was clean, there was a whole ridge of snow, pushed to one side on the bike lane.”View image in fullscreenHeavy snowfall on the A2 motorway during the morning rush hour in Utrecht.Photograph: ANP/ShutterstockThis week, according to the motor trade association Bovag, cars have been skidding off the roads partly because drivers failed to put on their winter tyres in October. The national airline, KLM, had to rush a truck to Germany to get 100,000 litres of de-icing fluid after it ran out, the spokesperson Elvira van der Vis said. ProRail, the rail infrastructure operator, spent much time explaining to angry commuters why trains kept being delayed –while Switzerland was managing just fine.View image in fullscreenA train arrives at Arnhem Central station after an IT outage at NS (Dutch Railways).Photograph: ANP/ShutterstockRico Luman, a senior economist on transport, logistics and automotive at ING, said a calculation of the economic cost of this failure would come later. “Ice days have come down from, let’s say, 10 to three on average a year and that’s part of the problem,” he said. “It’s simply not worth it to invest massively in all those contingency elements to avoid disruptions. But this time it may be different. The damage is piling up and it’s not over yet.”TheKNMI has modelledthat without global heating the current average snow cover of 5cm would have been 9cm – with some areas getting 22cm.“Our normal conditions would imply westerly winds with relatively mild temperatures because of the nearby North Sea,” said the climate scientist Hylke de Vries.“The Netherlands has never been a country where lots of snow was the norm, but of course with climate change, these cases where temperatures are low enough for snow decrease quite considerably. So when it happens, then everybody is surprised.”It is even more important to prioritise active mobility, according to Meredith Glaser, the chief executive of the Urban Cycling Institute. “We know that climate change doesn’t just mean warmer – it means more extreme and unpredictable weather,” she said. “These very intense cold snaps and snowfall mean that we need to make sure that our mobility networks are resilient.Snowdoesn’t necessarily stop people from cycling. But, of course, poor maintenance does. So the city needs to make sure that these main routes are safe and cleared.”Some continue to brave the icy roads, hoping they will not be the last generation to do so. “Funny to see how stubbornly Dutch people (including myself) keep their habit of cycling to work, even in this weather,” wrote Fonger Ypma on LinkedIn alongside a selfie taken at his snow-covered office in Delft.Ypma, the founder of a projectto thicken Arctic ice, said: “I see the spirit around me, but the younger generation is not so used to it. It fades away quite quickly if the [snowy] weather doesn’t occur any more.”Explore more on these topicsNetherlandsSnowEurope weatherEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

He now faces criminal charges in New York federal court, including “narco-terrorism conspiracy” for allegedly providing “law enforcement cover and logistical support” to major drug trafficking groups.While the two events are apparently unrelated, the shake-up in Caracas could eventually affect Catatumbo, given the well-established links between the ELN, which operates in both countries, and some elements of the Venezuelan National Guard.View image in fullscreenAerial view of Cúcuta near to the Venezuelan border in Colombia.Photograph: Schneyder Mendoza/AFP/Getty Images“We don’t understand about those things,” Alberto, in his thirties, said as his son slumped in the seat beside him, watching cartoons on a mobile phone. “We just know things in our region are bad. We couldn’t stay.”The Cúcuta city government had registered the arrival of 2,048 displaced people from Catatumbo since 22 December and expects more in the coming days. Residents of the region say many of their neighbours have fled to the city of Ocaña. At the start of 2025, more than 60,000 people were forcibly displaced from the region by combat and selective killings.mapThis time around, both groups are reportedly using armed drones to target their enemies and anyone suspected of collaborating with them. “People tell me they are nervous working their fields, constantly on the lookout for the drones,” said Eliana Zafra, a member of the Permanent Committee on Human Rights in Cúcuta.View image in fullscreenNational Liberation Army (ELN) rebels stand guard at an undisclosed location in the Catatumbo region.Photograph: STRINGER/AFP via Getty ImagesJuliana, a 50-year-old farmer from a village known as Filo Gringo (Gringo’s Edge) in the municipality of El Tarra, said the humming of the drones kept her and her husband on edge.

A few days later members of the Farc dissident group ordered her to leave her parcel of land immediately.“I didn’t even have time to pack some clothes,” she said at the ombudsman’s office in Cúcuta next to a door marked with a makeshift sign that read “Victims.”Juliana, who also asked that her real name not be used, said that since the US raid in Caracas, Venezuela’s National Guard troops on the other side of the border would not allow civilians to cross into the neighbouring country.View image in fullscreenRaspachines, the name given to coca leaf collectors, work in a plantation in Catatumbo.Photograph: Raúl Arboleda/AFP/Getty ImagesBut Javier Flores, a security analyst who monitors the region for the Ideas for Peace thinktank in Bogotá, said he doubted there would be any immediate shift in criminal border dynamics.“Everything changed, but it has remained the same,” he said, noting that the majority of Maduro’s government team is still in place, with his vice-president, Delcy Rodríguez,stepping in as interim president, with Trump’s blessing.“They [the ELN] have clear communication with [Venezuelan] officialdom, and that officialdom is still in place,” Flores said.In mid-December the ELN ordered civilians in areas under its control to stay home for three days to carry out military exercises in response to “intervention” threats fromDonald Trump.View image in fullscreenThe Catatumbo region is home to the largest area of illegal coca leaf crops in the world, making it a hub for organised crime.Photograph: Raúl Arboleda/AFP/Getty ImagesWith a force of about 6,000 combatants, the ELN ispresent in more than a fifth of Colombia’s more than 1,100 municipalities, according to Insight Crime. Its presence in neighbouring Venezuela spans eight of the country’s 24 states, the thinktank found in a recent report.Though it claims to be driven by leftist, nationalist ideology, the ELN is deeply involved in the drug trade and has become one of the region’s most powerful organised crime groups. While inColombiait is considered an insurgent group, its support for the Maduro government has led some analysts to call it a paramilitary force there. InSight Crime, an organised crime research centre, says that the Venezuelan ELN provides territorial, social, and political control in return for access to criminal rents from illegal mining, drug trafficking and cross-border trade.The ELN has taken part in failed peace negotiations with Colombia’s last five governments. Two years of talks with the government of the current president, Gustavo Petro – Colombia’s first-ever leftist leader – were suspended after the rebels intensified armed attacks in parts of the country.View image in fullscreenGraffiti on a wall demanding Colombia’s president Gustavo Petro comply to Catatumbo ELN.Photograph: STRINGER/AFP/Getty ImagesHowever, peace talks with the broader 2,500 strong dissident group that includes the 33rd Front, known colloquially as “Calarcá’s dissidence” for the nom de guerre of its leader, continue. In November the government announced a partial agreement that includes a temporary zone of concentration in Catatumbo.“The 33rd Front has strengthened with the negotiations, and what we see now is them trying to retake control of Catatumbo,” said Flores.He said that if the US decides to pressure the leadership in Caracas to crack down on ELN presence in Venezuela, it might drive its fighters back over the border, making an already volatile region even more dangerous.“Whatever happens, this won’t be good for the civilian population of Catatumbo,” said Zafra. “The conflict is going to intensify even more.”Explore more on these topicsColombiaUS attack on VenezuelaVenezuelaAmericasDonald TrumpfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Since then however, Trump has continued to assert that he is in fact “in charge”.Saturday’s operation in Caracas has been described by some as a violation of international law, but in his conversation with the Times, Trump said, “I don’t need international law.”When asked if there were any limits on his powers on the world stage, Trump said: “Yeah, there is one thing. My own morality. My own mind.”Trump said he was “getting along very well” withinterim president Delcy Rodríguez, adding that the US would be taking the country’s oil and “giving money to Venezuela, which they desperately need”.2.Seize Greenland or preserve the Nato alliance?Trump has spent the days since the attack on Venezuelarenewing his push for the US to acquire Greenlandand has not ruled out using military force to take it. He has framed the issue as one of national security, but when pushed by White House correspondent David E Sanger on why he hasn’t chosen to simply reopen bases and send troops to Greenland under the terms of a decades-old treaty, Trump insisted the territory must be part of the US.“I think that ownership gives you a thing that you can’t do with … a lease or a treaty,” the president said, adding “that’s what I feel is psychologically needed for success.”When asked by the Times whether obtaining Greenland or preserving the Nato alliance was more important, Trump declined to answer. He did however acknowledge that it “may be a choice” between the two options.Greenland was formerly ruled by Denmark – which still controls its foreign and security policies – and both countries are members of Nato. However in his interview on Wednesday, Trump said that alliance was essentially useless without the US.“I think we’ll always get along with Europe, but I want them to shape up … If you look at Nato, Russia I can tell you is not at all concerned with any other country but us,” he said.3.Taiwan is safe, for now ...When asked whether his actions in Venezuela may set a precedent for China to invade Taiwan, Trump said he saw no similarities between the two scenarios.“You didn’t have drugs pouring into China … You didn’t have the jails of Taiwan opened up and the people pouring into China,” Trump said, describing Venezuela as a “real threat”.In the days after the attack on Venezuela, commentators in China leapt on the operation as anexample of how an assault on Taiwancould play out. Leaders in the UK and Europe have also suggested China may be emboldened by Trump’s actions.The president, however, appeared sanguine about such a threat. He said it was up to Chinese leader Xi Jinping what China does in Taiwan, but added he would be “very unhappy” with a change in the status quo.”China views democratically governed Taiwan as its own – despite the rejection of such an idea by most Taiwanese people. Beijing has said it could use military force to take Taiwan, but the US president said he didn’t believe that Xi would make such a move during his term of power.“He may do it after we have a different president, but I don’t think he’s going to do it with me as president,” Trump said.4.Nuclear arms control treaty with Russia can lapseTrump indicated he would allow the last US-Russia strategic arms control treaty to expire, and did not say whether he would accept an offer made by Vladimir Putin in September last year for both sides to voluntarily maintain the limits on nuclear weapons deployments, once it ends.“If it expires, it expires,” Trump said of the 2010 New Start accord, which is set to end in February. “We’ll just do a better agreement.”Arms control advocates fear the world’s two biggest nuclear powers will begin deploying strategic warheads beyond the pact’s limits after it expires. Thomas Countryman, a former top state department arms control official, said there were “plenty of advocates in the Trump administration … for doing exactly that.”Trump has however said in the past that he would like to maintain the limits set out in the treaty after it expires. Theagreement limits the US and Russiato deploying no more than 1,550 warheads on 700 delivery vehicles – missiles, bombers and submarines.Under its current terms, New Start cannot be extended – the treaty allowed one extension and Putin and then president Joe Biden agreed to roll it over for five years in 2021.Trump told the Times that China, which has the world’s fastest-growing strategic nuclear force, should be included in a treaty that replaces New Start.5.Trump at his most casual, candid and conspiratorialThe Times reported that throughout the nearly two-hour interview Trump “tried on afull range of the personashe has used for decades in public life”, describing him as a “complainer”, a “father figure” and a “gracious host,” dispensing Diet Cokes at the push of a button.Transcripts and clips of the interviewreleased by the Times showed a president eager to embrace the freedom he wields as a leader untethered from many of the conventions that kept his predecessors in check.He candidly described his worldview, and when an aide emerged with a note informing him that “Colombian President Gustavo Petro is calling for you,” Trump put a “conspiratorial” finger to his lips to silence the group, and began the call in full view of the journalists interviewing him.Even when taking questions on his health, a topic that in the past has angered the president, Trump appeared calm, the Times said. When asked whether he had taken weight-loss drugs like Ozempic, Trump appeared to make joke, saying “I probably should.”With ReutersExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpVenezuelaTrump administrationUS politicsUS attack on VenezuelaUS foreign policyChinaexplainersShareReuse this content"

Almameh Gibba, an MP and one of the plaintiffs, tabled a bill to decriminalise FGM that wasrejected by the country’s parliamentin 2024.Activists and lawyers see this as the latest move in a backlash against women’s rights that is eroding gender protections across the world.Fatou Baldeh, founder of the Gambian rights organisationWomen in Liberation & Leadership, said: “FGM is a strong manifestation of violence against women that harms their physical and psychological health.“If this issue is still being [debated at a national level], it shows us that women’s rights are really regressing. This is not an isolated issue – it’s part of aglobal regression on women’s rights.”The Gambia has one of thehighest rates of FGMin the world. Almost three-quarters of women between 15 and 49have undergonethe practice and nearly two-thirds of them were cut before the age of five.View image in fullscreenMembers of the Gambian parliament debating whether to reverse the ban on FGM at the parliament in the capital, Banjul, in 2024.Photograph: Malick Njie/ReutersFGM involves the partial or total removal of the external female genitalia, which can have serious long-term health consequences, including infertility. It is generally carried out without anaesthesia by untrained “cutters” using non-sterile instruments such as knives, razor blades or pieces of glass, and girls are usually forcibly restrained.The practice is considered to be a grave violation of human rights and in 2012 theUN passed a resolutionto ban it. Although is still practised in about30 countries in Africa and Asia, FGM has no medical basis and is performed solely for cultural or religious reasons.View image in fullscreenAbdoulie Fatty, a leading imam who supports FGM.Photograph: Zohra Bensemra/ReutersUnder the current law in the Gambia, a cutter faces up to three years in prison, a fine of 50,000 dalasi (£500), or both. Where FGM leads to death, the perpetrator could face life imprisonment.Although criminalised in 2015, the law went unenforced until the first convictions took place in 2023. Three women were ordered to pay a fine or spend a year in prison for carrying out FGM on eight children. The convictionssparked a backlashagainst the ban, which led the country to the brink of repealing it.After the bill to overturn the law criminalising FGM was rejected, a coalition led by Gibba launched a case with the supreme court claiming that the law violated Gambians’ constitutional rights to cultural and religious freedoms.The court has heard from two witnesses so far, Abdoulie Fatty, a prominent Muslim leader, claimed in December that female circumcision, though not mutilation,was part of Islam and was not harmful.When asked what he said to the families of two people who died from the practice, he replied: “We are Muslims and if someone dies, it’s God’s will.”He said that the benefit of the practice was to reduce women’s sexual desire, which could be a problem for men.MPs in the Gambia vote to uphold ban on female genital mutilationRead moreAlso due to give evidence is Fuambai Sia Nyoko Ahmadu, a dual US-Sierra Leonean citizen and founder of a pro-FGM organisation, GambianWomenare Free to Choose.In December, she co-wrote an article, Harms of the current global anti-FGM campaign, for theBMJ Journal of Medical Ethics. The piece argued that “a ubiquitous ‘standard tale’ obscures the diversity of practices, meanings and experiences among those affected” by cutting.Representing the plaintiffs is Lamin J Darboe, a UK-trained lawyer with dual British-Gambian citizenship; hehas announced a bid to run for the presidencyin the country’s elections in December.View image in fullscreenPeople drive past a poster in Banjul calling for an end to female genital mutilation. The Gambia has one of the world’s highest rates of FGM.Photograph: Zohra Bensemra/ReutersIt comes after a ruling against Sierra Leone in July by the Economic Community of West African States (Ecowas) court of justice, which described FGM as “one of the worst forms of violence against women” which“meets the threshold for torture”.The president of Sierra Leone, Julius Maada Bio, is the current chair of Ecowas. Weeks after the ruling, he signed into law the Child Rights Act 2025, which did not ban FGM.“It speaks volumes that he refused to act on the ruling,” said Baldeh. “Within the region we have all these beautiful protocols and treaties protecting women and girls, which are all against FGM, yet nothing is being done.”Five key moments in the assault on the rights of women and girls in 2025Read moreAlso in Sierra Leone, there has been significant opposition to a bill on safe motherhood, which led to proposed amendments that restrict access to safe abortion.It is widely seen as part of a new wave of attacks on women’s rights worldwide. InAfghanistan, the Taliban is eroding any rights women had before the militant Islamists seized power; in the US,restrictions on access to abortion and contraception services are increasing, and in Iran,women are key targets of the regime.According to areport by Equality Now, new legislative proposals in Bolivia and Uruguay threaten to weaken protections against sexual violence.“Civil society organisations face increasing pressure under repressive laws, such as in India and Kyrgyzstan, while government bodies responsible for advancing women’s rights are being dismantled in South Korea and Argentina,” said the report.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

Earlier this week, the president suggested production in Venezuela could be boosted within 18 months.Trump plans to use Venezuela’s huge crude reserves ‘to cut US oil price to $50 a barrel’Read more“We’re going to be extracting numbers in terms of oil like few people have seen,” he said on Friday, emphasizing that the US stands to benefit from lower energy prices. “Venezuela is going to be very successful, and the people of the United States are going to be big beneficiaries.”Notably, Trump said the investment would be coming from the oil companies, not the federal government. Earlier in the week, he had suggested that the US taxpayer might fund their investments.“The plan is for them to spend, meaning our giant oil companies will be spending at least $100bn of their money, not the government’s money,” Trump said. “They don’t need government money, but they need government protection and government security.”Trump warned the assembled executives that, if they aren’t interested in rebuilding efforts: “I got 25 people that aren’t here today that are willing to take your place.”While he offered them “total safety”, the president also suggested some of the oil firms present did not need the US government’s help. “These are people that drill oil in some pretty rough places,” he said. “I could say a couple of those places make Venezuela look like a picnic.”In brief remarks, oil executives – for many, the first public statements since Maduro’s capture – expressed willingness to rebuild Venezuela’s oil infrastructure with the US government’s reassurances.Chevron “has been a part of Venezuela’s past, we are certainly committed to its present, and we very much look forward as a proud American company to help it build a better future”, said Mark Nelson, vice-chair of Chevron, currently the only US major that regularly exports Venezuelan oil.Nelson said the company currently had 3,000 employees across four different joint ventures in Venezuela and that it had the capacity to “increase our liftings from those joint ventures 100% essentially, effective immediately”.Darren Woods, Exxon’s chief executive, said the company expected “significant changes” to Venezuela’s legal and commercial landscapes in order for the company to reinvest in the country. “Today it’s uninvestable,” he said.“We’re confident that with this administration and President Trump, working hand in hand with the Venezuelan government, that those changes can be put in place,” Woods said.The ConocoPhillips CEO, Ryan Lance, echoed the cautious optimism, saying that “there’s an opportunity to be quick, fast and restore the quality of what’s been lost in Venezuela over the last 25 years”.Lance also noted that ConocoPhillips is Venezuela’s largest non-sovereign credit holder, with the country holding $12bn in debt to the company. Though Trump assured the company that it will get its money back, “we’re going to start with an even plate”.“We’re not going to look at what people lost in the past, because that was their fault. That was a different president. We’re going to make a lot of money, but we’re not going to go back,” he said.Venezuela’s oil reserves are reputedly the world’s largest. While the country’s oil industry experienced a boom in the late 90s and early 2000s, the then Venezuelan president, Hugo Chávez, eventually reasserted state control over the industry in the mid-2000s. In the years since, oil production in the country has fallen drastically as its infrastructure aged and investment dried up.Though Maduro is being tried in US federal court on “narco-terrorism” charges, Trump has been very enthusiastic about Venezuela opening back up to the American oil industry. On Wednesday, the White House said that it planned tocontrolVenezuela’s oil “indefinitely” and that it would sell billions of dollars’ worth of recently seized crude oil.History from the last two decades has shown that foreign intervention can have an impact on a country’s oil output, but withmixed and unstableresults.Oil is experiencing aglobal surplus.

Because of this cooperation, I have cancelled the previously expected second Wave of Attacks, which looks like it will not be needed.”Trump did not elaborate on the alleged plan for fresh strikes but said the US navy armada in the Caribbean would remain, leaving Washington with the ability to attack Venezuela at short notice. “All ships will stay in place for safety and security purposes.”On Friday morning, US marines and navy sailorsseized a fifth oil tanker, the Olina, which was falsely flying the flag of the small south-east Asian country of Timor-Leste, in the Caribbean near Trinidad. The assault was launched from the aircraft carrier USS Gerald R Ford, which remains positioned off Venezuela’s coast.In a post on Truth Social later on Friday, Trump said the Olina was “on its way back to Venezuela”.At a meeting with American oil industry figures at the White House, Trump said the US would sell up to 50m barrels of Venezuelan oil and pick which firms could invest in the country.“One of the reasons you couldn’t go in [was] you had no guarantees, you had no security, but now you have total security,” Trump told the executives. “You’re dealing with us directly. You’re not dealing with Venezuela at all. We don’t want you to deal with Venezuela.”The Venezuelan government earlier said it had received a “delegation of diplomatic officials from the US Department of State who will carry out technical and logistical assessments inherent to the diplomatic function”, with a view to the “restoration of diplomatic missions in both countries”.The expectation is that the assessment will lead to the gradual reopening of the US embassy, which has had no diplomats since 2019, when the US and other countries declared Nicolás Maduro’s government illegitimate and recognised Juan Guaidó as interim president.“Likewise, a delegation of Venezuelan diplomats will be sent to the US to carry out the corresponding duties,” the regime added, while insisting on framing the move as part of its efforts to “address the consequences arising from the aggression and the kidnapping of the president of the republic and the first lady, as well as to pursue a working agenda of mutual interest”.On Thursday, Venezuelaannounced the releaseof an “important number” of detainees. About 24 hours later, however, human rights organisations were able to confirm only about a dozen releases and are pressing the regime to free all political prisoners, who they estimate number between 800 and 1,000.The Committee for the Freedom of Political Prisoners posted that it was stationed outside various prisons, where “institutional indifference persists”. “In many cases, officials claim to be unaware of release orders; in others, even while acknowledging the official announcements, they point to the alleged absence of release warrants,” the NGO said in a statement.The former opposition candidate Enrique Márquez was among those released from prison, according to an opposition statement. “It’s all over now,” Márquez said in a video taken by a local journalist who accompanied him and his wife, as well as another freed opposition member, Biagio Pilieri.Enrique Márquez and his wife after his release from prison in Venezuela.Photograph: Frederick Villegas/Márquez family/AFP/Getty ImagesSpain’s foreign ministry confirmed the release of five Spanish nationals, one of them a citizen with dual nationality, who it said were “preparing to travel to Spain with assistance from our embassy in Caracas”.On Thursday, Trump said he planned soon to meet the Venezuelan opposition leaderMaría Corina Machado.Since the US operation to capture Maduro on 3 January the future governance of the South American country has remained an open question, with Trump over the weekenddismissing the idea of working with Machado, saying “she doesn’t have the support within or the respect within the country”.But in a Fox News interview on Thursday, the US president said Machado was “coming in next week sometime”, adding: “I look forward to saying hello to her.”Asked whether he would acceptMachado’s Nobel peace prizeif she gave it to him, Trump said: “I’ve heard that she wants to do that. That’d be a great honour.”This will be Trump’s first meeting with Machado, who said this week that shehad not spoken to the US presidentsince she won the prize in October.Trump has not publicly made the same offer to Delcy Rodríguez, Venezuela’s interim president, although in aninterview with the New York Times on ThursdayTrump said the US was “getting along very well” with Rodríguez’s government and that they were “giving us everything that we feel is necessary”.From elation to frustration: Trump snub wrongfoots Venezuela’s oppositionRead moreOn Friday, the retired diplomat Edmundo González, who was chosen by Machado torun for president in 2024– and who, the opposition has shown by obtaining copies of the tally sheets, did in fact win the vote – said he had spoken by phone with Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, and told him that “democratic reconstruction in Venezuela depends on the explicit recognition of the electoral result of 28 July 2024”. González has beenliving in exile in Spainsince September.Colombia’s president, Gustavo Petro,said in an interview published on Friday by El Paísthat during a one-hour phone call with the US president this week, “Trump told me he was thinking about doing bad things in Colombia. The message was that they were already preparing something, planning it – a military operation.”Asked whether he feared suffering the same fate as Maduro, Petro said: “Undoubtedly. Nicolás Maduro, or any president in the world, can be removed if they do not align with certain interests.”Strikes on Colombian insurgent groups in Venezuela are apparently not off the table, however. On Thursday, Colombia’s interior minister said that during a call between Trump and Petro, the Colombian leader asked for US cooperation in combating fighters of the National Liberation Army (ELN), whose troops straddle the border.Petro asked if the US could help “hit the ELN hard on the border because when we attack they always end up in Venezuela and there have been times when Venezuela helped and other times it hasn’t”, he told local radio station Blu Radio. “They agreed to conduct joint operations against the ELN.”In recent days, Colombia’s defence minister, Pedro Sánchez, has taken to calling the 6,000-strong ELN a “cartel”. While the group was born as a leftist Cuba-inspired guerrilla force in the 1960s, it has since become deeply involved in Colombia’s drug trade.Trump told Fox News that it would take time for Venezuela to get to a place where it can hold elections.US strikes on alleged drug boatsin the eastern Pacific Ocean and Caribbean Sea have killed more than 100 people since they began in September. They formed part of a concerted pressure campaign on Maduro that culminated in his dramatic abduction by US forces.As part of that campaign, the US was understood to have conducted a strike on a docking area inside Venezuela, but land strikeswould mark a significant escalation, with suggestions they could target cartels in Mexico.“We are going to start now hitting land with regard to the cartels. The cartels are runningMexico,” Trump told the broadcaster Sean Hannity on Fox News.Sibylla Brodzinsky, Reuters and Agence France-Presse contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsUS attack on VenezuelaVenezuelaTrump administrationDonald TrumpAmericasUS politicsMaría Corina MachadonewsShareReuse this content"

Italy’s Giorgia Meloni, long seen as a key vote, backed it, allowing the landmark deal to be adopted under qualified majority voting rules.The European parliament must approve the deal to bring it into force, but as trade falls within the exclusive competence of the European Commission, its head, Ursula von der Leyen, is expected to travel toParaguayon Monday to formally sign the agreement.Von der Leyen said the EU had listened to farmers, describing the deal as a “win-win agreement” yielding a €50bn opportunity to EU exporters by 2040 and €9bn growth to Mercosur countries. She also vowed to step up import controls to ensure EU standards on meat and other farm produce imports were upheld.Supporters of the deal say it will help deepen the EU’s economic cooperation with the global south, where China is already seeking alliances in the wake of the disruption Donald Trump has caused to the international trade order.It will also help the EU wean itself off China for critical minerals and rare earths vital for the auto and tech sectors as these elements are abundant in the Mercosur countries.Brazil accounts for about 20% of the world’s reserves of graphite, nickel, manganese and rare earths. But it also holds 94% of global reserves of niobium, a metal used in the aerospace industry, while Argentina is the third largest producer of lithium, a material used in batteries in electric vehicles.“The deal is not only about economics. Latin America is a region of intense competition for influence between western countries and China. Failing to sign the EU-Mercosur free trade agreement risked pushing Latin American economies closer to Beijing’s orbit.“The conclusion of the deal also signals that Europeans are serious about diversifying their export markets away from the US,” said Agathe Demarais, senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations, a leading thinktank.Farmers in beef, poultry and grain sectors claim they arecollateral damage.“This will kill our agriculture in Poland,” Janusz Sampolski, a Polish farmer, told Agence France-Presse. “We will be dependent on supply chains from other countries,” he said, adding that it could threaten Poland’s food security “in the event of the threat of war”.The Climate Action Network said the deal was not only about tariffs and quotas but would “drive deforestation” and “worsen human rights conditions in some of the world’s most sensitive ecosystems” with incentives to farm more beef and soy and timber for paper in deforestation-prone areas.Explore more on these topicsEuropean UnionEuropeFrancePolandBelgiumArgentinaBrazilnewsShareReuse this content"

It is the fifth interdiction of such ships in recent weeks, separately from the series of previous US operations since the start of the fall to strikesuspected drug boatsoff the coast of Venezuela.The pre-dawn action against the oil tanker on Friday was carried out by US marines and navy sailors from the forces the US has built up in the Caribbean in recent months, according to US Southern Command,which declared“there is no safe haven for criminals” as it announced the seizure of the vessel. The assault was launched from the aircraft carrier the USS Gerald R Ford.The Trump administration has moved to control the distribution of Venezuela’s oil products globally after its ousting and capture of the Venezuelan president,Nicolás Maduro, less than a week ago from the capital city, Caracas, in a night-time raid which included airstrikes and US special forces deployed on the ground.Southern Commandalso postedunclassified footage on social media of a US helicopter landing on the vessel and armed US personnel conducting a search of the deck, with the military forces acting in support of the US Coast Guard, which was in charge of the operation under the auspices of its parent agency the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).The DHS secretary,Kristi Noem, on X said the shipwas seizedin international waters and added: “As another ‘ghost fleet’ tanker ship suspected of carrying embargoed oil, this vessel had departed Venezuela attempting to evade US forces … The ghost fleets will not outrun justice.”The Olina, according to public shipping database Equasis, was falsely flying the flag of the tiny south-east Asian nation ofTimor Leste.“The vessel’s AIS [location] tracker was last active 52 days ago in the Venezuelan EEZ, north-east of Curacao,” Vanguard, a British maritime risk management company, said separately.Trump claims he has cancelled second wave of attacks on VenezuelaRead more“The seizure follows a prolonged pursuit of tankers linked to sanctioned Venezuelan oil shipments in the region.”The Olina left Venezuela last week fully loaded with oil as part of a flotilla shortly after Maduro’s capture on 3 January, and the vessel was returning fully loaded to Venezuela after the US blockade of Venezuelan oil exports, the industry source said.US government records show that the Olina was sanctioned for moving Russian oil under its prior name, Minerva M, and flagged in Panama.While records show that the Olina is now flying the flag of Timor-Leste, it is also listed in the international shipping registry as having a false flag, meaning the registration it is claiming is not valid. In July, the owner and manager of the ship on its registration was changed to a company in Hong Kong.The US government said it was part of the so-calledshadow fleetof ships that sail with little regulation or known insurance.According to ship-tracking databases, the Olina last transmitted its location in November in the Caribbean, north of the Venezuelan coast. Since then, however, the ship has been running dark with its location beacon turned off.The ship has a listed cargo capacity of up to 890,000 barrels of oil, which at the current market price of about $60 a barrel would be about $53m.Venezuela’s government on Friday acknowledged that US diplomats had traveled to the South American country, and announced that it will send a delegation to the US but it did not say when.Officials said US diplomats were in Caracas to discuss reopening the country’s embassy.The government of interim president Delcy Rodriguez “has decided to initiate an exploratory diplomatic process with the government of the United States of America, aimed at re-establishing diplomatic missions in both countries,” foreign minister Yvan Gil said in a statement.John McNamara, the top US diplomat in neighbouring Colombia, and other personnel “traveled to Caracas to conduct an initial assessment for a potential phased resumption of operations,” a US official said on customary condition of anonymity.Reuters and the Associated Press contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsUS attack on VenezuelaVenezuelaAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

The ministry called the development “a positive step in the new phaseVenezuelais entering”.Spain’s foreign minister, José Manuel Albares, told the public broadcaster RNE that the dual national being released wasRocío San Miguel, a Spanish-Venezuelan lawyer, activist and human rights defender who was detained in February 2024 and accused by the regime of treason, conspiracy and terrorism in connection with an alleged plot to assassinate Maduro.Venezuela’s opposition leader, María Corina Machado, hailed the releases, saying they showed that “injustice” would not prevail in the country. “This is an important day because it shows what we have always known: that injustice will not last forever and that truth, although it be wounded, ends up finding its way,” she said in an audio message published on social media.It is unclear how many people are being freed. Human rights organisations working in the country estimate that Venezuela holds between 800 and 1,000 political prisoners, most of them detained for taking part in protests after the 2024 election, widely believed to have been stolen by Maduro.The head of Venezuela’s national assembly, Jorge Rodríguez, the brother of the acting president, Delcy Rodríguez, said the move was a “unilateral gesture to reaffirm our unbreakable decision to consolidate peace in the republic and peaceful coexistence among all”.As the news of the planned release broke, families of detainees rushed to prisons across the country, seeking information.Pedro Durán, 60, was among those hoping to reunite with his brother Franklin Durán as he waited outside a prison in the town of Guatire, about 43km (25 miles) outside Caracas. Durán said his brother was detained in 2021 on charges of trying to overthrow Maduro’s government – an accusation his family denies.Durán, who has been living in Spain, heard rumours on Wednesday that the government could release a number of detainees and immediately bought a plane ticket from Madrid to Caracas to find his brother.“I don’t have words to express the emotion I’m feeling,” Durán said. “We’re feeling a lot of hope ... We’re just waiting now.”Before Venezuela’s announcement, estimates suggested there were more than 40 foreign nationals detained in the country, including about 20 Spaniards and five US citizens, among them James Luckey-Lange, 28, who disappeared in December and was being held at military counterintelligence headquarters in Caracas.On Tuesday, Donald Trump said Venezuela had “a torture chamber in the middle of Caracas that they’re closing up”, without elaborating. In recent days, speculation has centred on the Helicoide de la Roca Tarpeya, an iconic structure inaugurated in 1956 as an avant garde shopping centre and later turned into a prison and torture site underChavismo.View image in fullscreenEl Helicoide de la Roca Tarpeya in Caracas, Venezuela.Photograph: Jesús Vargas/Getty ImagesMartha Tineo, the general coordinator of the NGO Justicia, Encuentro y Perdón (Justice, Encounter and Forgiveness, or JEP), which monitors political detentions in Venezuela, said she had confirmed that some sections of El Helicoide are being vacated.“But the Helicoide complex is vast. It not only houses the prison where political detainees are held, but also administrative offices of the Bolivarian National Police, and those are the areas that are being cleared … So we might assume that over the coming days – hopefully within a week, or however long it takes – we may indeed see the closure of that immense torture centre, but for now, that is not happening,” she added.JEP estimated that there were 1,017 political prisoners before Rodríguez’s announcement. By 10.30pm UK time on Thursday, the organisation had confirmed only “around eight or perhaps 10 political prisoners”, but said it would not disclose names to avoid raising anxiety among families who have been waiting for months – and in some cases years – for news of their loved ones.The announcement of the detainees’ release is being treated with caution by activists. In the days leading up to the US operation, the regime said it would release 187 people –99 on Christmas Dayand 88 on New Year’s Day – but organisations were able to independently verify the release of only a portion of that total.Although she has so far confirmed only a few releases, Tineo remains hopeful. “The information we have is that it is very likely that many releases will take place – or at least that is what has been said [by the regime],” she said, adding that the release process, which involves legal procedures, can take time, potentially days when dealing with large numbers of people.“That is why we have been calling for composure and calm, to keep us united in both hope and vigilance,” Tineo added.Alfredo Romero, the head of Foro Penal, an NGO that estimates there are still 806 political prisoners in Venezuela, posted that by early evening he had only been able to confirm five releases. “We expect the freedom of all political prisoners, not partial and conditional gestures,” he wrote, referring to the fact that many people freed in recent months were granted only conditional liberty, subject to precautionary measures such as travel bans, mandatory court appearances and restrictions on speaking to the media about their cases.At a press conference announcing the decision, Jorge Rodríguez – who many believe is now effectively running the country alongside his acting-president sister – said that “within a few minutes” the public would learn “the nature of the people who are receiving the benefit of release”, something that had still not happened hours later.He added: “In order to contribute and collaborate in the effort that all of us must make for national unity and peaceful coexistence, the Bolivarian government, together with the institutions of the state, has decided to free an important number of Venezuelan and foreign individuals, and these release processes are taking place from this very moment.“Consider this gesture by the Bolivarian government, with its broad intention of seeking peace, as the contribution that all of us must make so that our republic can continue its life in peace and in pursuit of prosperity.”Explore more on these topicsVenezuelaAmericasNicolás MaduronewsShareReuse this content"

The city was 42.9C at 3:40pm, with 44C recorded in suburbs including Laverton and Viewbank.Catastrophic and extreme fire danger ratings were in place throughout Victoria, with the entire state under a total fire ban. The central district, which includesMelbourne and Geelong, was approaching catastrophic with a fire danger rating of 99 (100 or more is considered catastrophic).Fires were expected to be “unpredictable, uncontrollable and fast-moving”, Victoria’s emergency management commissioner, Tim Wiebusch, said as the extreme heat combined with damaging winds and the risk of dry lightning.View image in fullscreenFirefighters, supported by aircraft and heavy machinery are strengthening containment lines around a fire burning within the Wadbilliga national park, approximately 20 km north-west of Cobargo, NSW.Photograph: NSW Rural Fire ServiceView image in fullscreenA fire burning east of the Princes Highway, 46km south of Eden, NSW.Photograph: NSW Rural Fire ServiceExtreme conditions extended across much of South Australia as well as the New South Wales Riverina.

Total fire bans were in place for those districts as well as the central ranges, greater Hunter and the far south coast.The City of Canterbury Bankstown, in western Sydney, was extending opening hours for its pools and libraries, with hotter temperatures expected in western suburbs.On Thursday, many places recorded their hottest January temperature on record, said Sarah Scully, a senior meteorologist at the bureau. They included Renmark, which reached 47.3C, and Loxton at 46.2C, both towns in SA’s Riverland, as well as Hopetoun (46.3C) in Victoria’s Mallee.Tarcoola, in SA’s far north, reached 48.2C on Thursday.There was little relief for people in heatwave affected areas after days of extreme daytime temperaturesturning into warm nights. Renmark’s minimum overnight was 30.9C.“People need to take action to stay cool, hydrated and stay indoors where possible,” Scully said.Q&AWhat happens to the body during a heatwave?ShowHeatwaves put intense stress on the body - particularly the cardiovascular system and kidneys. The heart has to work hard to deliver oxygen and nutrients to organs while also increasing blood flow to extremities. Cardiovascular collapse – the heart suddenly failing – is a main cause of heat-related death in Australia.Symptoms to watch out for:- Hot skin- Confusion- Weakness- Cramps- Dizziness- Vomiting- FaintingWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.In Victoria, a section of the Hume Highway remained closed, public land and parks were closed, and several regional train and coach services cancelled.

ABC radio presenters David Marr and Jonathan Green had confirmed their withdrawal.Others to quit the event included commentators Jane Caro and Peter FitzSimons, the co-founder of Cheek Media, Hannah Ferguson, the journalist and academic Peter Greste, First Nations academic and writer Prof Chelsea Watego,political analyst Amy Remeikis and economist, politician and author Yanis Varoufakis.Australian authors Bri Lee and Madeleine Gray said they would not participate unless the festival reversed its decision and reinstated Abdel-Fattah.Abdel-Fattah, a Macquarie University academic, was due to appear at the festival for the second time next month after hosting a number of panels and sessions in 2023.But in a statement released on Thursday, the festival board said it had formed the view that it“would not be culturally sensitiveto continue to program her at this unprecedented time so soon after Bondi”.The board said that while it did not suggest “in any way” that Abdel-Fattah or her writings had any connection with the tragedy at Bondi, the decision was made “given her past statements”.Adelaide festival dumps prominent academic Randa Abdel-Fattah over ‘cultural sensitivity’ concerns after Bondi attackRead moreAbdel-Fattah previously facedsustained criticismfrom the Coalition, some Jewish bodies and media outlets for controversial comments on Israel, including alleging Zionists had “no claim or right to cultural safety”.Co-founder of Cheek Media, Hannah Ferguson, described the board’s decision as “ censorship”.The former NSW premier and federal foreign affairs minister Bob Carr told Guardian Australia he would remain a speaker and supported the board’s decision.Despite being a vocal critic of Israel’s invasion of Gaza, Carr said he believed some of Abdel-Fattah’s previous statements had been counterproductive to the Palestinian cause. He said the board had made the right call.“The Adelaide writers’ festival has supported hearing Palestinian voices, its record on this is unimpeachable,” Carr said, adding that given the circumstances at Bondi, the board’s decision was not unreasonable.“The board should be supported, and people sympathetic to the Palestinian cause should continue to participate in [the festival].”The Iranian Australian Booker prize-nominee Shokoofeh Azar said she understood the reasoning behind the board’s decision and would still participate.“In recent months, the voices of supporters of Palestine have been clearly heard globally, but the voices of ordinary Israelis – not the government, but citizens – have been heard far less,” she told the Guardian.“I believe that if we truly care about justice and peace, we must allow all voices to be heard. Cultural spaces should be places for dialogue and for hearing multiple narratives, not for a single dominant voice.”Burial Rites author Hannah Kent described the decision to axe Abdel-Fattah as a “gross act of discrimination and censorship” as she announced her withdrawal in a social media post.Remeikis condemned the board’s “deliberate choice to silence a prominent Palestinian-Australian academic without offering any clear or convincing rationale”.Wright, who was co-curator of the 2025 Bendigo writers’ festival, which experienced a similar mass walkout, said she was “appalled” at what she described as the “wrong-headedness and short-sightedness of the Adelaide festival board’s decision”.“As a Jewish Australian, I am shocked and insulted that the board could exploit the tragedy of Bondi to weaponise its much-loved and respected literary festival,” she said.Public policy thinktank the Australia Institute on Thursday withdrew its sponsorship for the 2026 event, which it said in the past had “promoted bravery, freedom of expression and the exchange of ideas”.Speaking to ABC radio on Friday, Abdel-Fattah said the decision showed the “egregious and unabashed anti-Palestinian” views that she said had become normalised.It was an “obscene attempt to associate me with an atrocity … that it goes without saying that I had nothing to do with,” she said.“I cannot believe in 2026, that I, a Palestinian who has witnessed my people’s livestream genocide for two years, am now having to say publicly ‘I have nothing to do with the Bondi atrocities’.”Abdel-Fattah asked the festival to apologise, retract its statement and reinstate her invitation.Asked about the boycott, Abdel-Fattah said it was “heartening to see the wave and momentum that is built in solidarity”.“What makes this particularly egregious is the board would have known that this was going to happen,” she said.On Thursday, the academic said she was confident that the writing community and public would respond with “principle and integrity”.Last year, Abdel-Fattah was among more than 50 writers and hostswho pulled outof the Bendigo writers’ festival after it issued alast-minute code of conduct, including directions to “avoid language or topics that could be considered inflammatory, divisive, or disrespectful”.“In the end, the Adelaide writers’ festival will be left with panellists who demonise a Palestinian out of one side of their mouths while waxing lyrical about freedom of speech from the other,” she said.In 2023, the Adelaide writers’ week director, Louise Adler, resisted pressure towithdraw invitations to two Palestinian writersover their views on Ukraine and Israel.The Stella Prize-winning poet Evelyn Araluen was one of the first writers on Thursday to publicly withdraw from the lineup in support of Abdel-Fattah.The author of Dropbear and The Rot described the decision as a “betrayal” of the democratic ethos that has defined the festival.“Erasing Palestinians from public life in Australia won’t prevent antisemitism. Removing Palestinians from writers’ festivals won’t prevent antisemitism. I refuse to participate in this spectacle of censorship.”The festival board was contacted for comment.Explore more on these topicsAdelaide festivalSouth AustraliaAdelaideBondi beach terror attacknewsShareReuse this content"

And we’re not going to have Russia or China as a neighbor.”He added: “So we’re going to be doing something with Greenland, either the nice way or the more difficult way.”‘We are not for sale’: chair of Greenland’s top labor union rebukes Trump’s call for annexationRead moreTrump’s latest comments come amid escalating tensions between the US and its Nato allies, including Denmark, over his administration’s repeated attempts to take control of the largely autonomous Arctic territory. Trump’s posture has beenfirmly rejectedby Denmark and Greenland.Despite admonishments from Danish prime minister Mette Frederiksen, whorecently saidthat a US attack on Greenland would mean the end of “Nato and therefore post second world war security”, Trump has continued to insist that he supports the alliance.“If it weren’t for me, you wouldn’t have aNatoright now,” Trump said on Friday. “But we’re not going to allow Russia or China to occupy Greenland, and that’s what’s going to happen if we don’t.”Trump has long expressed interest in Greenland, first publiclyfloating the ideaof acquiring the territory in 2019 during his first presidency. The proposal met swift opposition from Danish and Greenlandic leaders.Trump revived the topic in recent weeks, particularly after theUS attack on Venezuelaand its capture of president Nicolás Maduro and his wife, an episode reflecting the White House’s increasingly emboldened posture. Trump said he needed Greenland“very badly”as a national security imperative.Meanwhile, Greenlanders have repeatedly expressed their refusal to be part of the US, with 85% of the populationrejectingthe idea, according to a 2025 poll. Polling shows only7% of Americanssupport the idea of a US military invasion of the territory.Greenland was not the only issue on Trump’s radar on Friday. He warned that the US would take action against the Iranian regime if it moves to violently suppress protesters as demonstrationscontinue to growacross the country.Describing Iran as being in “big trouble”, Trump said: “If they start killing people like they have in the past, we will get involved. We’ll be hitting them very hard where it hurts.”He added: “And again, I tell the Iranian leaders: ‘You’d better not start shooting, because we’ll start shooting too.’”Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpGreenlandDenmarkUS politicsEuropeNatoUS foreign policynewsShareReuse this content"

A national day of mourning was observed on Friday and a memorial ceremony attended by top European officials, including the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and his Italian counterpart, Sergio Mattarella, was held in a town close to Crans-Montana.Swiss authorities have confirmed thetotal death toll at 40, the majority in their teens and 20s – the youngest 14 – and mostly from Switzerland, France and Italy. Afurther 116 were injured, 83 of whom are still being treated in hospital for severe burns.Anger and dismay have meanwhile mounted as details on the cause of the fire and staggering lapses in safety procedures emerged.View image in fullscreenJacques and Jessica Moretti arrive for questioning  in Sion.Photograph: Ümit Bektaş/ReutersJacques and Jessica Moretti, the owners of the bar, areunder investigation for manslaughterthrough negligence. Mr Moretti was arrested and held in custody after the couple were questioned by prosecutors in Sion on Friday morning, a source told the Guardian.The couple, who bought the bar in 2015 before renovating it, have denied any wrongdoing and in a statement this week said they were “devastated and overwhelmed with grief” while promising “full cooperation” with the investigation.Authorities said the fire started in the bar’s crammed basement room after sparklers attached to champagne bottles wereheld too close to a ceilingbelieved to have been clad with soundproofing foam. A haunting image shared on social media showed a female server sitting on the shoulders of a male colleague holding a bottle with sparklers in each hand before the flames caught the ceiling. The woman was among those who died.The investigation is focusing on renovations made to the bar, the fire-extinguishing systems and escape routes, as well as the number of people in the building when the fire started.In an astonishing admission on Tuesday, Nicolas Féraud, the mayor of Crans-Montana, saidno safety inspections had been made on the premises since 2019. He could not explain why the annual inspections were not done despite the procedure being required by local law. “We’re profoundly sorry, and I know how hard that will be for the families,” Féraud said, adding that his administration wanted to show “full transparency”.‘It has hit us very hard’: grief grips Crans-Montana as police identify more victimsRead moreLawyers representing the families of those who died or were injured in the tragedy have accused investigators of not moving quickly enough to secure crucial evidence.As firefighters worked to extinguish the blaze, Romain Jordan and Ronald Asmar, lawyers with the Geneva-based firm Merkt, claimed that the bar’s owners appeared to have deactivated its Instagram and Facebook accounts, in the process “deleting pictures and videos that could have been useful to the investigation”. The Guardian has contacted the couple’s lawyers for comment.View image in fullscreenFirefighters and emergency responders form a circle after a tribute ceremony for the victims of the fire.Photograph: Maxime Schmid/AFP/Getty Images“This attitude should have alerted the prosecutors immediately,” added Jordan, who alongside Asmar was present during the Morettis’ questioning on Friday. He claimed authorities initially tried to keep lawyers representing families out of the hearing. “The authorities are only now starting to take the full measure of the investigation.”Jordan said that everyone, especially those living in the French-speaking part of Switzerland, had been “personally affected [by the tragedy] at some level or another”.“The first tier of this tragedy is seeing young lives ending in this way, or being hurt and bearing scars for ever,” he said. “Then you quickly understand that it perhaps happened because of human mistakes … and the worst thing is that the authorities were perhaps complacent. So all of these layers add up to an incomprehensible nightmare, making it difficult to accept.”He added: “The whole world is looking at us because, if it can happen in Switzerland, one of the richest countries in the world, where could it not happen? What led to this tragedy and how can we make sure that that it never happens anywhere else?”Authorities are already taking heed. As thousands of bars, restaurants and nightspots were checked in Crans-Montana and surrounding towns, new safety measures were announced in Vaud canton, where Lausanne is located.As normal life resumes after the Christmas and New Year holiday, the tragedy is still dominating conversations. “It’s definitely on everyone’s minds, and with all the other stuff happening all of a sudden in the world, people are overwhelmed,” said Ronnow.“But what has been super shocking for me and a lot of others is that, even though the attention has been on Le Constellation, it could easily have happened elsewhere. When I go to a nightclub it is really common to see bottles with sparklers. There’s now a big push to check safety regulations, but people are thinking: ‘It could have been me.’”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

Schools were closed and more than 700 sanitation workers deployed to clear streets in Hamburg.Outside the northern port city of Bremerhaven, three youths were taken into custody for throwing blocks of ice on to the motorway into incoming traffic. Police said several vehicles were hit but there were no reports of injuries.Authorities advised those who could stay at home to do so to avert accidents while telling motorists to fill up their tanks and place blankets and water in their vehicles in case they get stranded.Central and southern Germany, where temperatures were slightly higher, were bracing for freezing rain. Overnight three people were slightly injured in Baden-Württemberg state when a bus skidded on ice down a hillside.Berlin and the surrounding Brandenburg state, initially expected to be pummelled with ice and snow by Elli, appeared likely to be spared the worst of the storm. “We see no danger to life and limb,” a DWD spokesperson said, calling off a previous warning.Explore more on these topicsEurope weatherGermanyFranceEuropeSnownewsShareReuse this content"

Or a friendly young woman with flowing locks and a crown of braids?To Belgian art dealer Klaas Muller, an answer to that question mattered less than the fact that this particular take on the duck-rabbit optical illusion was painted by one Peter Paul Rubens.Three years ago, the Brussels-based former gallerist managed to effectively acquire not just one but two studies of heads by the Flemish baroque master in one painting, paying the “reasonable price” of less than €100,000 at an online auction.The auctioneer, which Muller would identify only as a “lesser-known auction house in northern Europe” for fear of encouraging too much future competition, had advertised the work as an undated study on paper by an anonymous master of the “Flemish school”.View image in fullscreenThe study of an old man was painted on a reused sheet of paper, and when turned over, the silhouette of a woman’s head appears through the model’s beard.Composite: Peter Paul Rubens/Klaas Muller/Brafa Art FairIn the recent past,studies by Rubenshave sold for between £500,000 and £1m or more.“I wasn’t sure it was a Rubens, I just knew it was very Rubens-esque, so it was still a gamble,” said Muller, who describes himself as a passionate admirer of the 1577-born artist and diplomat. “I have a library of books about him at home and look at them most evenings,” he told the Guardian. “It’s a bit of an addiction.”He felt more confident when the painting was delivered to his home. “It was very dirty, but the varnish had protected the painting very well and I could see that it was of extremely high quality.”But it was not until after the picture was studied for several months last year by the art historian Ben van Beneden, a former director of the Rubens House, that Muller started to feel confident he had acquired a genuine old master.“I think it’s very likely,” said van Beneden. “You have to be cautious because you are dealing with a painting that wasn’t made for the market but as a working material. But the craftsmanship is outstanding – it has a very lifelike quality.”The old man figure in the study appears in several of Rubens’ better-known paintings. “He is omnipresent and versatile,” wrote the Belgian newspaper De Standaard, which broke the news of the painting’s discovery this week.In The Raising of the Cross, a raised altarpiece in Antwerp Cathedral, the old man is depicted as Saint Amandus. InThe Adoration of the Magi, which hangs in the Prado museum in Madrid, he is a red-cloaked King Melchior. InThe Tribute Money, at the Legion of Honour museum in San Francisco, he is the Pharisee peeking out from behind Jesus.View image in fullscreenThe Adoration of the Magi, Peter Paul Rubens, 1609 and 1628-29, features the same model as a red-cloaked Melchoir.Photograph: Museo del PradoInspired by Italian painters, Rubens collated a series of different physiognomies he could use for larger paintings.He is known to have created a prototype study of the old man’s head that has since been lost. “Muller may indeed have found the prototype,” van Beneden said.Long-lost Rubens painting sells for $2.7m at auctionRead moreThe woman inside the old man’s beard, however, was painted first. Rather than trying to create an optical illusion, Rubens probablyreused the paperof an earlier painting and traced over it, Muller said.The painting hangs in Muller’s home and will go on display at the Brafa art fair in Brussels on 25 January. Even as a study, the art dealer said, it deserved as wide an audience as possible. He hoped that a museum would agree to take the painting on a long-term loan.Explore more on these topicsArtNetherlandsBelgiumPaintingEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Authorities look more vulnerable this time around because of the dire economic situation and the aftermath of last year’s conflict with Israel and the US.Trump, in an interview with Fox News on Thursday, suggested the supreme leader was preparing to flee Iran. “He’s looking to go somewhere. It’s getting very bad,” he said.On Friday night he warned Iran’s leaders that they “better not start shooting because we’ll start shooting too”.Graph showing Iran’s annual consumer price inflation rateThe head of Iran’s judiciary, Gholamhossein Mohseni Ejei, said consequences for demonstrators would be “decisive, maximum and without any legal leniency”.The leaders of France, Germany and the UK released a joint statement on Friday night urging Iran to exercise restraint.“We are deeply concerned about reports of violence by Iranian security forces and strongly condemn the killing of protesters,” they said. “The Iranian authorities have the responsibility to protect their own population and must allow for the freedom of expression and peaceful assembly without fear of reprisal. We urge the Iranian authorities to exercise restraint, to refrain from violence and to uphold the fundamental rights of Iran’s citizens.”An internet blackout introduced on Thursday has sharply reduced the amount of information flowing out of the country. The Iranian rights group Hengaw reported that a protest march after Friday prayers in Zahedan, where the Baloch minority predominates, was met with gunfire that wounded several people.Amnesty International said the “blanket internet shutdown” aims to “hide the true extent of the grave human rights violations and crimes under international law they are carrying out to crush” the protests.Norway-based NGO Iran Human Rights, raising a previous toll of 45 issued the day earlier, said at least 51 protesters, including nine children, have been killed by security forces and hundreds more injured.The US-based Human Rights Activists news agency said that at least 50 people have been killed in the violence surrounding protests, while more than 2,270 others have been detained.Videos from the protests on Thursday showed crowds of thousands of people marching through the streets of Tehran, setting fire to a building belonging to the Iranian state broadcasters and hoisting a flag bearing the lion and sun emblem – the flag of Iran before the 1979 revolution that brought the current regime to power.View image in fullscreenAli Khamenei speaking in Qom yesterday.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesReza Pahlavi, the exiled son of the late shah, who had called for the protests on Thursday night, made another call for demonstrations to take place at 8pm (1630 GMT) on Friday. He also called on Trump to help the protesters, saying Khamenei “wants to use this blackout to murder these young heroes”.Footage from Thursday showed protesters chanting in support of Pahlavi, including in Mashhad, Khamenei’s home town. Protesters who went out on Thursday night said they were met with violence – part of what rights groups are calling an already brutal crackdown.“They’re aiming for the eyes,” Maryam, a 25-year-old artist who was at protests in Tehran in the early hours of Friday, told the Guardian via text message. “The Faraja [uniformed police], the Basij [paramilitary militia] and even plainclothes kill squads are driving into the crowds with motorbikes. I don’t know how long the internet will be working but we are thousands on the streets and I fear I will wake up to hundreds of casualties.”Map of protests in TehranIranian state media acknowledged the protests for the first time on Friday, casting the unrest as violent riots instigated by “terrorist agents” of the US and Israel. State TV channels projected an air of normality, airing footage of pro-government demonstrations and saying life went on as usual for most Iranians.State media claimed Iran had caught agents from the Mossad, Israel’s intelligence agency, who had infiltrated protest movements. The Iranian-owned Press TV reported that an Israeli spy cell was planning a “false-flag killing operation aimed at blaming the state for civilian deaths”.Speaking in Beirut on Friday, the Iranian foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, echoed claims of overseas interference. “The protests that are happening in Iran of course are different from protests in other countries because of US and Israeli interventions in the protests,” he said. “You need to look at all the statements from the US and Israel to see how they are interfering.”Authorities cut off internet access in Iran at about 8pm local time on Thursday, about the same time as Pahlavi’s call for protests. Understanding exactly what was happening in Iran and the true size of protests was difficult, with data and phone lines down. Human rights groups said documenting human rights violations was also hampered by the shutdown.View image in fullscreenPeople gather on the streets during a protest in Mashhad, in a screen grab obtained from a social media video on Thursday.Photograph: Social media/ReutersStudents at a university in Tehran said they were trying to find a way to avoid the internet shutdown, relying on methods they developed during the war with Israel in the summer when authorities also shut down access.Hossein, a 22-year-old university student, said: “Since June we have been trying several ways to find these ‘secret tunnels’ that can route our messages outside the country. A group of us are able to still chat but I can see mobile lines are also getting disrupted.”Demonstrators appeared to respond to Pahlavi’s call on Thursday, with anti-government chants ringing out at 8pm, as well as calls for the exiled crown prince to return.One protester, Mehnaz, said she believed Pahlavi could assist with a transition to democracy. “We failed to unify under a strong opposition last time [2022] but we have learned our lessons,” said the 46-year-old. “We have to rally for him because we are desperate to survive.”Elements of the protest movement, largely leaderless until now, have rallied around the figure, though it was unclear if chants were mainly in support of the crown prince or of pre-1979 rule.“I am proud of each and every one of you who conquered the streets across Iran on Thursday night,” Pahlavi said in a post on X. “I know that despite the internet shutdown and communication, you won’t leave the streets. Make sure that victory is yours!”Graph showing Iran’s GDP growthPahlavi’s call for more demonstrations on Friday would be a further test of the exiled figure’s popularity and the staying power of protests in the face of the authorities’ crackdown.His organisation alleged that tens of thousands of security officers had signalled their intention to defect via a platform it had set up, and that the organisation had been inundated by requests from officers.‘In isolation, we’ll never flourish’: What Iranians think about the protests and an end to the Islamic RepublicRead moreHuman Rights Watch (HRW) and Amnesty International condemned what they said was authorities’ use of force and mass arbitrary arrests. HRW has documented the deaths of 28 protesters who were shot by security forces between 31 December and 3 January, with instances of authorities using rifles and shotguns loaded with metal pellets.“We have so far documented many of the harrowing patterns of human rights violations that authorities have repeatedly committed during the previous rounds of protest crackdowns, including in November 2019, and the Woman, Life, Freedom protests of 2022,” said Bahar Saba, a senior HRW researcher on Iran and Kuwait.The crackdown seemed only to harden the resolve of protesters, many of whom described scenes of defiance including rocks thrown at officers, forcing them to retreat.Ali, a 21-year-old student in Tehran, said via text message: “Fuck them! The cowards abandoned their vehicles and fled! We took over the streets tonight. We will burn their vans, the same that they use to drag our compatriots and kidnap our sisters from the streets. The country belongs to us!”Anger at the theocratic regime and its clerics seemed to boil over throughout the week. On Wednesday, crowds of men streamed into a Shia seminary in the city of Gonabad, beating staff with sticks and damaging the facility, according to the director of the seminary, Ismail Tavakoli.Another person said unarmed protesters were confronting riot police and throwing rocks in response to bullets fired by officers. “They are vulgar and are saying we are in bed with the Israelis and Americans,” said Farzad, a 37-year-old mobile shop owner in the city of Rasht in northern Iran. “They call us traitors. It’s them that have betrayed the very sense of being an Iranian.”With Agence France-PresseExplore more on these topicsIranAyatollah Ali KhameneiProtestMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

They described it as a referendum on his leadership and that the response showed he had won.Yet the issue of an alternative leadership for Iran remains unresolved. Many Iranians, eager to end the 47-year-long rule of the clerics, still view a return to monarchical rule with suspicion.On the international stage,Donald Trumphas yet to endorse Pahlavi.Pahlavi’s supporters, including on the foreign satellite channels, highlight the many calls for the return of the shah being heard in the crowds. However, just as Trump did not rush to back the candidacy of the Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado, the US president is being equally cautious about Pahlavi, apparently fearing the US may end up entangled in a civil war.The lack of a clear alternative leadership or even a single set of political demands by the protesters, apart from ending corruption, repression and inflation, has been a boon to Pahlavi since he at least has name recognition and has nurtured support for the monarchy for decades.Others inside Iran capable of leading the country to a secular future, such as Narges Mohammadi and Mostafa Tajzadeh, have been locked in jail sporadically for years.One Iranian described Iran as living in an era of no manifesto politics.mapPahlavi, calling on his supporters to take to the streets again on Friday, is due at an event in Mar-a-Lago, Florida, on Tuesday, but his team stressed he had not yet been granted a meeting with Trump, and the event, a Jerusalem prayer breakfast, was unconnected with the US president’s team.In a sign of Trump’s caution, the president has also avoided acting on his unspecific pledge to come to the aid of the Iranians if they were being attacked.Trump’s caution has led to reports the president may be exploring a deal with a breakaway group inside the government. Officials from Oman, traditional mediators between the US and Iran, are due in Tehran this weekend. Although desperation is setting in, there is no sign the panic that has swept parts of the government is forcing the supreme leader to rethink his determination to retain Iran’s uranium stockpile or aspirations to enrich uranium inside the country. For him it is a symbol of national sovereignty.But Trump may also be wary of a full embrace of Pahlavi since it is possible to misinterpret the calls for his return.In an internal analysis given to the Guardian, one Iranian said: “What is heard in the slogans today is not a call [to] return to the crown; it is an escape from a dead end. A society that has no way out retreats – not out of interest, but out of compulsion. This retreat is not a choice; it is the nervous reaction of a tired political body that no longer responds to prescriptions.map“For decades, society was told to ‘wait’. It waited. It was told ‘it will be fixed’. It wasn’t fixed. It was told ‘it can’t get worse, it’s enough’. It got worse. Then they said ‘we have no alternative’. And this was precisely the moment when the street created its own alternative; not with classical rationality, but with the instinct for survival.“The monarchist slogan is not a declaration of love for Pahlavi: it is a declaration of disgust for the Islamic Republic. It is a cry of ‘no’ when no ’yes’ is available … Everyone is stuck in the past or in empty promises. When the horizon is empty, society looks back because it sees nothing ahead.”The Iranian Writers’ Association also called for caution about “externally imposed solutions”.“Freedom certainly will not fall from the sky with bombs and missiles from predatory powers. Those who have risen up against the status quo while maintaining their independence from domestic and foreign exploiters,” the group said. “Neither wait for repetition of an imaginary past and its heralds, nor wait for fake reformers.”Pahlavi has long been disliked by the left in Iran. The Syndicate of Workers of Tehran and Suburbs Bus Company, one of the most prominent independent unions, said on Wednesday it opposed “the reproduction of old and authoritarian forms of power”.“The path to liberation of workers does not lie through the path of a leader carved above the people nor by relying on foreign powers,” it added.Either way, the current reformist Iranian leadership, struggling to understand the evaporation of the nationalism created by the 12-day war in June, has few solutions left. It can rally the people against what it claims are foreign malice and rioters. It can hope somehow the technocrats in the economics ministry and Central Bank have gathered the resources to stabilise the currency.Ahmad Naghibzadeh, emeritus professor of political science at the University of Tehran, warned the solutions may no longer be technocratic, but historic. He told Euronews: “In the end, there will be no choice but to repeat in Iran what happened in Europe, that is, they decided the dispute between religion and state in favour of the state.”Explore more on these topicsIranMiddle East and north AfricaDonald TrumpanalysisShareReuse this content"

Under the terms of the ceasefire, Kurdish militants were to leave the three contested neighbourhoods of Sheikh Maqsoud, Ashrafieh and Bani Zaid, where clashes were happening. They would be provided safe passage to the north-east of the country, which is controlled by the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), and be allowed to take light arms with them.In a statement, Kurdish councils that run the Sheikh Maqsoud and Ashrafiehdistricts of Aleppo said calls to leave were “a call to surrender” and that Kurdish forces would “defend their neighbourhoods”, accusing government forces of intense shelling.View image in fullscreenPeople flee the Sheikh Maqsoud neighborhood of Aleppo on Friday.Photograph: Ghaith Alsayed/APA resident of Aleppo said the fighting appeared to cease overnight and footage from within the contested neighbourhoods showed that gunfire, which was constant over the last few days, had stopped. Members of the government security forces posted videos showing clearing operations being conducted in some of the neighbourhoods, as well as videos of underground tunnels being inspected that the SDF have used to transport fighters and weapons beneath Aleppo.Relations between the Syrian government and the SDF, which holds about a third of Syria’s territory, have worsened in recent months. The two sides signed a deal for the SDF to be integrated into Syria’s new army by the end of last year, but negotiations to implement the agreement ground to a halt.The government in Damascus has styled the SDF as a separatist entity undermining the unity of the Syrian state, while the SDF has described the new government as “jihadists” and expressed fears about the safety of ethnic and religious minorities under its rule.Aleppo, where the SDF controlled a pocket of Kurdish-majority neighbourhoods otherwise surrounded by the Syrian government, had been a flashpoint for months. The latest round of fighting has deepened divisions between the two sides, with the SDF leader, Mazloum Abdi, saying that the last few days of conflict had undermined “the chances of reaching understandings”.The Syrian government also said in a statement that government control needed to be extended over the entirety of Syria, and the monopoly of violence remain with the state, to “preserve the unity of Syria”.View image in fullscreenResidents of Sheikh Maqsoud leave the area through a humanitarian corridor opened by the Syrian government on Friday.Photograph: Bilal Al-Hammoud/EPABoth sides have accused the other of committing war crimes over the past three days, with the SDF saying Damascus was guilty of ethnic cleansing and the crime of forced displacement by ordering civilians to leave their homes ahead of shelling. The government in Damascus claimed the SDF was using civilians as human shields and of sniping at people who attempted to leave the neighbourhoods via the humanitarian passages set up by the government.The SDF is backed by the US, which for years equipped and armed the Kurdish force in its fight against Islamic State in Syria. The US has tried to mediate a merger between the SDF and the new government in Damascus for months, but little has changed on the ground since the fall of President Bashar al-Assad last year.Turkey, one of Damascus’s key backers, views the SDF as an extension of the Kurdistan Workers’ party (PKK), a Kurdish separatist group with which it has fought a gruelling 40-year insurgency. Turkey has said it is ready to assist the Syrian government if it requests it.“The SDF’s insistence on protecting what it has at all costs is the biggest obstacle to achieving peace and stability in Syria,” the Turkish foreign minister, Hakan Fidan, said in a press conference on Thursday.The status of the SDF and the swathes of the country it holds remains a sticking point with Damascus, which is seeking to fully consolidate its control over Syria.Agence France-Presse and Reuters contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsSyriaKurdsMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

She has a page online where she sells her clothes and had arranged for a prominent influencer to run a major promotion for her. But because of the current situation, the influencer returned the money, and her sales and page activity came to a halt.Now she is left with money that has lost much of its value and winter fabrics she bought to make and sell clothes. With everything suspended, she has become very depressed, mostly staying at home and feeling unwell.View image in fullscreenMahsa*“I feel like I have to start all over again. Everything I worked for, all the effort I put in, is gone. I really don’t know what to do withthese dollar prices. Even if the market opens again, how are we supposed to buy fabric and sell it at these rates?“How can we even live? I love freedom. I want a day to come when there’s freedom in Iran. But I have no hope in these protests. Theprotests [after the death of Mahsa Amini] in 2022 were even biggerand nothing happened. I don’t think anything will change this time. I’m not in favour of war at all.”Even if Pahlavi sits at the top of Iran, he won’t be the one making decisionsMoien, clothing entrepreneurMahsa says she would be very happy if the regime fell and the government changed, but she has very little hope of this happening. She dreams of being able to build a comfortable life for herself. She and her family are facing financial difficulties now, and her father, in his 70s, is still working for a meagre salary, which deeply troubles her.“This uncertainty, this suspended state, is what bothers us the most. Nobody knows what’s going to happen.”Moien*, 40, clothing entrepreneurMoien designs and sews clothing, and owns a store selling suits and other apparel. He has been able to rent a space and sell his work, but says his position is extremely precarious and unstable.Now in his 40s, he feels the weight of a midlife crisis and is exhausted from running so hard only to feel that he has not truly achieved anything.View image in fullscreenMoienHe has been married for a couple of years and lives with his wife in a rented apartment. With the sharp fall in the rial against the dollar, market strikes and the shutdown of online shops, Moien says he is facing heavy losses, with a large stock of winter clothing past its prime sales period and no effective way to sell it.Iran is a country that has failed, says Moien. Even if the Islamic Republic were overthrown today, it would take at least 50 years to rebuild. And even then, it would not become an ideal country, just a normal, functioning one. He sees Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of the former shah whose return some are now seeking, as a mere figurehead.“Even if he [Pahlavi] sits at the top of Iran, he won’t be the one making decisions. He has never lived here, doesn’t understand the country, its crises or its politics. He’s not a strong politician. In my view, he’s just a puppet, and whatever they [US and Israel] tell him to do, he will comply.”When asked about the future, Moien says that he plans to emigrate in the next three years to live with his aunt, but wants to continue his fashion business in Iran. One of his worries is what will happen to domestic producers like him when the regime changes. Will they be crushed immediately? He fears they will be devastated before they can recover.I don’t think we’ll live to see freedom or improvement in Iran unless it’s in old ageSasha, sports coachMoien says his younger brother was recently summoned to the security prosecutor’s office for posting protest stories on Instagram, and his phone line had been cut. Having lost his parents, Moien is the only close family his brother has, and he pays his rent and living costs since his brother has never held a stable job and constantly faces financial difficulties.Sasha, 35, sports coachSasha grew up in a middle‑class family, but says he was never given substantial financial support. From childhood, he worked on his own, earning money mostly through sports and coaching. He says he has been unable to secure a home or a stable life for himself and is still unmarried. He sees no clear future for himself or his generation.“We’re basically written off. I don’t think we’ll live to see freedom or improvement in Iran unless it’s in old age, watching younger generations finally experience change.”View image in fullscreenSashaSasha says he hopes for the collapse of the Islamic Republic and the establishment of a democratic republic in Iran’s future.He believes in popular power, but says that unless the army stages a coup and weapons fall into the hands of the people, it is impossible to overcome the Revolutionary Guard, given the number of bases and arms depots they control.I have no hope in regime change through war or sudden collapse, and I don’t support it. The consequences would be terrifyingHasan, gold market traderBecause he works under the supervision of a sports federation, he cannot express his protest publicly or on social media. The federation has threatened that any member who shares content about the uprising will be expelled.Majid, 36, unemployedMajid says he worked hard from childhood doing an assortment of jobs before working in decorative stone mines and eventually selling stones himself. But his business collapsed as he could not keep up with inflation. “After Covid, everything fell apart, both my family life and the country’s economy.View image in fullscreenMajid“I have reached the conclusion that staying inactive and not working actually brings more benefits. And not just me, all my friends reached the same conclusion. Whether they have money or not, everyone has decided that in this situation, doing nothing is better. My friends don’t work any more. They just smoke.“What can I really do? I’ve wrecked myself. And I keep thinking: how is a young beginner, someone who wants to build a life, even supposed to start? After all these protests, the [cost of the] dollar and gold hit record highs.“My separation from my wife – if you look back at it – economic conditions were one of the reasons. We bought a house on instalments and couldn’t keep up with the payments. The government has created a situation where everyone wants to screw each other over just to survive.“I honestly see no clear future for Iran any more. Either the country gets sold off so the Islamic Republic leaves and then it’s finished that way. Or it stays and drives the country into absolute ruin. Either way, it’s ruined.“I’m not optimistic about anything. I’m just standing still, waiting to see what happens. After separating from my wife, I became depressed. The only thing keeping me alive is theatre rehearsals. It’s the only place where I can escape this numb depression.“My brothers, every one of them, are drug dealers. They’ve spent years in prison. I was the ‘good kid’ among them. I tried to make a living the right way and that turned out to be impossible too. My only wish is that one day Iran reconnects with global trade. Our kids are full of brilliance, full of talent, sharp and intelligent, but in isolation, they’ll never flourish.”Hasan, 29, gold market traderHasan works in the gold market inside Tehran’s Grand Bazaar, where theprotests first started in December. He says the bazaar merchants had been talking for a long time about striking and protesting as inflation drove prices ever-higher.“It’s true that as gold prices rise, the capital of some gold sellers increases, but their customers are disappearing, and they themselves oppose these price hikes. People’s purchasing power keeps falling. This uncertainty and lack of clarity exhausts me and fills me with despair, but I remain committed to the strikes and hope good things will happen.”View image in fullscreenHasan“I believe these protests and demonstrations will eventually create some change. They can be effective over time. I think these uprisings will happen repeatedly, in several phases, slowly, and each time there will be more defections.”I’m certain that by the end of January, the US will intervene, the Islamic Republic will fall, Pahlavi will come and everything will be perfectAshkan, unemployedHasan says the core of the Islamic Republic must be removed, but that the structures themselves should remain in place to prevent chaos. “Gradually, reforms and changes should take place within those structures and competent people should take over. Otherwise, I have no hope in regime change through war or sudden collapse, and I don’t support it. The consequences would be terrifying, and I’m not optimistic about that path. I prefer gradual reform.”Ashkan, 28, unemployedAshkan is 28 years old and lives alone in a house in northern Tehran. He is financially well-off; his father, who owns several well-known restaurants in one of Iran’s provinces, gives him a generous allowance every month. He says he used to work in the market, but now he doesn’t have a serious job and relies on his father’s money.View image in fullscreenAshkanHe says the Islamic Republic will be finished by the end of this month. “I’m certain that by the end of January, the US will intervene, the Islamic Republic will fall, Pahlavi will come and everything will be perfect.”When asked what his father thinks, Ashkan says: “He’s also praying for Pahlavi to come. He’s been saying for a long time that the Islamic Republic is doomed and that they will go.” He says his father’s businesses have not been affected by the strikes. “My father says that during these days the government had closed things, a lot of travellers came to our town, and actually, the food sold better than usual.”Farshad, 37,interior designerFarshad lives alone in a rented apartment and is single. He is under significant stress due to debts he has taken on for his work, explaining that he borrowed in dollars, and since then the exchange rate has doubled. He pays an extremely high rent, but says at his age, living with family is no longer an option.He says he does not think anything will change with protests, but says that if the Iranian president resigned and the US intervened militarily, the situation in the country would ultimately improve. There would be an initial economic shock and hardship, he says, but in the long run, reconnecting with global markets would make life better for everyone.“I’m not a supporter of Pahlavi. He says he will hold a referendum, but I don’t really believe it. Khomeini [the former supreme leader] used to say the same things. Still, I’ve reached the conclusion that even Pahlavi coming to power would be better than the current situation.”Farshad says university students have not yet entered the protests in a serious way. If they do, he believes the movement would become more progressive and move beyond Pahlavi being seen as the only option. In his view, the best possible scenario is for the protests to continue expanding, while the US and its allies strike at the forces and commanders of the Islamic Republic, allowing Iran and the protests themselves to fall into the hands of the people.View image in fullscreenFarshadEven if conditions remain difficult after a regime change, he wants to remain in Iran and be present for the transformations and upheavals.* Names have been changed and interviewees kept anonymous"

He has not seen them in person since autumn of that year.Photograph: HandoutAbudagga told the Guardian that when he read the Home Office’s latest judgment, “I felt my final hope of being reunited with my wife and children after more than three years had been lost. It was very, very hard.”His wife’s response on hearing the news was desperate. “She kept saying to me when I called: ‘It seems we will never meet again. Don’t make any more efforts to bring us to the UK because it seems the UK will never get us there. Just keep concentrating on your studies,’” he said.The Home Office letter also said consideration had been given as to whether his wife and children’s circumstances “outweigh the interests of national and border security” and – by rejecting his request – implied they did not.Abudagga said: “When I read that they link bringing my family to the UK with UK security, and suggest the children are better off in Gaza, I simply could not believe in British values and norms any more. I expected the British government cared about family life, about human rights.”In his latest request for the government to help, Abudagga asked the Home Office specifically to give a decision in principle on his family’s visa applications before his wife had attended a VAC.Crucially, had he succeeded in this request, he could then have approached the Foreign Office for help with evacuating them to a country where Marim could have attended a VAC. But the request was turned down.View image in fullscreenThe children and their mother are now living in a camp near the sea in Gaza.Photograph: SuppliedThe Home Office’s UK decision-making team stated that it was “not satisfied that their circumstances are sufficiently compelling for [us] to be able to deviate from our normal policy that requires your clients to attend a VAC prior to consideration of their applications”.It also stated that because Abudagga had said he would want eventually to return to Gaza if and when he had a home for his family there, his stay in the UK was therefore considered temporary. “Consequently it is appropriate for your minor clients to remain with their primary carer, their mother, until circumstances change,” it said.In language that has appalled supporters of Abudagga’s case, the Home Office said in its response to his lawyers that it accepted “that circumstances in Gaza are difficult and that due to displacement it may be more difficult to access certain necessities. It is also acknowledged that you have informed us that your clients are displaced from their home due to evacuation orders.”.However, it was “not satisfied” that there was sufficient evidence to show their case was urgent or that the family reunion could not be delayed “until it is safe to visit a VAC”.Legal sources dealing in such cases say there has been a noticeable toughening of Home Office responses over recent months as the government attempts to clamp down on immigration and asylum in response to the rise of Reform UK. Many cases involve Palestinians trapped in Gaza.Abudagga says his wife and children are living in terrible conditions, short of food, suffering from the winter cold and under constant fear of bombardment despite the fragile ceasefire. The Guardian haspreviously reportedon the trauma suffered by Talya, Karim and their mother as a result of Israeli bombardments, moving homes and constant hunger.View image in fullscreenThe family are living in terrible conditions, Abudagga says.Photograph: SuppliedMarim is now mourning her father, who died two weeks ago. “My wife is trying to do the daily duties of bringing food, securing the tent from the weather – it is very cold, very windy, very rainy – when her father passed away two weeks ago. The details are very, very hard,” Abudagga said.In asimilar caserecently highlighted by the Guardian, another PhD student was evacuated with her family to the UK, having been allowed to do her biometrics in Jordan. This raised Abudagga’s hope that his case would be looked on favourably. “This lady was allowed to get her fingerprints done in Jordan and the Home Office later allowed her family to join. The case is the same as mine,” Abudagga said.The Home Office was approached for comment and was asked whether it realised that it was impossible for Marim to reach a VAC in Gaza because there was not one.Abudagga’s local MP, Rebecca Long-Bailey, has written to the home secretary, Shabana Mahmood, to ask the Home Office to reconsider his case but it has stuck by its decision.Abudagga has now instructed the human rights firm Leigh Day to represent him in challenging the Home Office’s refusal.Sarah Crowe, a human rights lawyer at Leigh Day, said: “We will be writing to the Home Office to set out why their decision-making in this case is plainly unlawful. In line with the Home Office’s own policy, Bassem’s family should have their applications predetermined, which is an important step in reuniting the family.”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

Sultana revealed the new membership portal on X, urging supporters to “be a part of history”, and reassured her followers that the membership site was “safe and secure”, encouraging them to keep trying to sign up despite “issues due to such high traffic”.Later the same day, Corbyn issued an “urgent message” telling his followers on X to ignore the “unauthorised” site and said “legal advice is being taken”.After the referral to the ICO, the information watchdog advised Corbyn’s PJP, the data controller for Your Party, that it was not a matter for the ICO at this stage. The guidance, firstreported by the New Statesman, advised the PJP to consider going to Action Fraud, now known as Report Fraud, and the police to determine whether the issue constituted criminal activity.The advice noted that as “serious criminal activity may have occurred”, any police investigation would take primacy over one by the ICO at this stage.A spokesperson for the ICO said: “After reviewing the information provided, we have assessed that formal ICO involvement is not required at this time.”A source said the ICO’s advice regarding the police “should not be interpreted as a determination or conclusion in any direction” and it remained in contact with the parties involved.On Friday Sultana issued a statement which said the ICO had “dropped the case around theYour Partymembership portal”.Writing on X on Friday, Sultana said: “I always anticipated that this inquiry would conclude with no further action and I am pleased that everyone can now draw a line under the matter.”Sultana said she was looking forward to campaigning for a “Central Executive Committee (CEC) that breaks decisively from Labour right tactics, gives power to members and local branches, and helps build a mass movement for socialism”.She added: “I will continue working closely with Jeremy and comrades across the movement to build on our 60,000 members – the largest socialist party in the UK since the 1940s. Let’s get to work.”A source close to Sultana said the police were “likely to be even less interested in this matter” than the information commissioner. “Zarah remains focused on building a successful mass socialist party and will not be distracted by those who want this project to fail,” they said.Your Party declined to comment.Explore more on these topicsYour PartyZarah SultanaJeremy CorbynInformation commissionerParty fundingnewsShareReuse this content"

There were about 3,000 homes without power in the West Midlands, more than 1,000 in the East Midlands and about 240 inWales.View image in fullscreenWintry conditions in the west end of Aberdeen after heavy snowfall overnight.Photograph: Beth Edmonston/PADowning Street said support was being offered to homes left without power.A No 10 spokesperson said: “Around 0.21% of British customers are without power.

Comfort said they could not identify anything that was antisemitic or supportive of terrorism or violence.Abu-Sittah, who studied at the University of Glasgow and lives in London with his wife and three sons, had also reposted a tweet that said: “We congratulate our brothers in Hamas and our comrades in the Popular Front on the anniversary of their inception.”Hamas’s political wing became proscribed under the Terrorism Act in 2021. The tribunal said it did not have evidence as to when the tweets were posted other than that it was some time before 2023.The tribunal further found that the “ordinary reader” would see the tweet as a celebration of an anniversary and not as “material or moral aid” to terrorism.A second tweet by the medic spoke of “martyrs in the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine”, referring to a man who carried out the first operation using a suicide belt, in 1974, and a second man who died during fighting in 1973.Abu-Sittah said those with an understanding of the political context of the 1970s would see this post as only demonstrating “solidarity” with the Palestinian cause.Comfort said the tweet, read through the lens of an ordinary, reasonable Arabic reader, could not be seen as inciting or supporting violence or terrorism.The Kuwaiti-born medic said he had been racially profiled as “inherently violent” because he was a Palestinian and Arab, and accused the organisation UK Lawyers for Israel, which brought the matter to the attention of the GMC, of “trying to destroy my life”.After the hearing, he said: “My immediate thoughts are with my patients in Beirut, whom I was forced to leave in order to attend these proceedings. I have spent my entire medical career treating the victims of war and political violence. I was therefore deeply shocked to be accused of advocating violence. I do not, and have never, supported violence against civilians.“This complaint forms part of a broader lawfare strategy which aims to instrumentalise the regulatory processes to intimidate, silence and exhaust those who speak out against injustice in Palestine. This was the second complaint made against me to the GMC by UK Lawyers for Israel, and the 10th complaint made by them overall. The tribunal’s decision now stands in full view of the public.”A spokesperson for UK Lawyers for Israel said: “It is shocking that the tribunal has found it acceptable for doctors to commemorate acts of violence and pay tribute to terrorists. He has brought the profession into disrepute and Jewish patients are likely to be terrified of being treated by him.”Ros Emsley-Smith, representing the GMC, said Abu-Sittah had “overstepped the boundary of legitimate political speech and into the realms of misconduct”.The rector of Glasgow University is elected by students. Abu-Sittah is not a member of university staff and does not speak for the university.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

A public consultation would also examine alternative options, including a rise of 3.99% – although that increase would create a deficit of £4.1m.Opposition councillors in Kent accused Reform of betraying voters who had last year received leaflets from the party pledging to freeze or cut council tax.The draft budget is to be voted on at a full meeting next month. Reform still holds a significant majority in Kent, despite a series of defections and ejections of its own councillors.Bitter divisions among Reform councillors were laid bare byfootage leaked to the Guardian in October, which showed a chaotic internal meeting where members were told to “fucking suck it up” if they did not agree with decisions.Draft budget details – including the proposed increase – were published late on Thursday night after expectations they would come out earlier in the week.Linden Kemkaran, the leader of Kent county council, said the proposed draft budget reflected what she described as the “progress” made since Reform took over the council after last year’s local elections.“When this administration took office, the council was facing a very serious financial situation. KCC was saddled with more than £700m of debt, around £84,000 was being spent every day on interest alone, and pressures on vital services were continuing to grow.“Since then, we are on track to deliver £100m of savings and income, we have reprofiled almost £40m of future spending, and we have reduced the council’s debt by £67m,” she said.Kemkaran said details of the draft budget proposed a council tax increase of 3.99%, instead of the 5% figure anticipated when the current administration took office, and had been achieved while protecting frontline services.However, the opposition Liberal Democrat group on the council accused Reform of financial mismanagement and a “total betrayal” of election promises.Reform UK accused of ‘empty rhetoric’ over plan to hike council tax 5% in DerbyshireRead more“Despite campaigning on a platform of tax cuts, Reform’s budget will see the average Band D household pay roughly £67.47 more per year,” said the Liberal Democrat leader, Anthony Hook.“Reform stood for election promising to make savings and lower the burden on taxpayers. Today, that promise has been utterly broken. They are boasting about a nearly 4% increase instead of 5%, a difference of just 33p per week for the average Kent family. It is a poor outcome given the hype and promises made at the election and for the last nine months.”Alister Brady, a Labour member of the council, said: “Reform will try to deflect and mislead but the facts are clear. During the election they said they would cut council tax but in their first budget they have put council tax up and they will need to do that for every year of their three-year budget because of their overspending. They should be honest with the public.”There was also criticism from others who had originally been part of Kent’s ruling Reform group.Bill Barrett, one of a number who have set up as independents, said: “Kemkaran may be able to say she has kept council tax rises as low as possible, but that £10m less coming in from council tax means £10m of savings that have to now be found.“Alongside the fact we are drawing down on reserves again in this budget, I really do fear for services across Kent once we delve into the details of this draft budget.”Tony Travers, a visiting professor in the London School of Economics’ department of government, said: “Reform has been enduring a long and sharp learning experience in the last year about the realities of running council budgets that have been squeezed for the past 15 years.”But he added: “Frankly I am surprised that few, if any, have managed to achieve a figure significantly below 5% because it would have provided Farage with impressive political ammunition given their hopes of making further gains in local elections next year. Given that most of them are coming out with the maximum allowed increase it will be evidence, lest we need it, that there is no efficient ‘Reform way’ of filling a pothole.”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

ICE, however, had disputed this, asserting she is a Mexican citizen who entered the US unlawfully.According to Díaz Morales, ICE agents detained her near her home on 14 December while her family watched. She told the DC, Maryland and Virginia news outletWRC-TVthat she attempted to explain she was born in Maryland – but said authorities did not accept her explanation. She added that her faith and the hope of reuniting with her family helped her endure the detention.Díaz Morales said she lived in Mexico starting at age seven and returned to the US more than a year and a half ago. She believes confusion arose because she used her mother’s last name while living in Mexico, whereas US records list both her father’s and mother’s last names.Renee Nicole Good said ‘I’m not mad at you’ before ICE agent shot her, video showsRead moreFour days after her arrest, a Maryland federal district court judge issued anorder preventingthe government from deporting her while the court reviewed a petition filed by her attorneys challenging her detention.One of her lawyers, Victoria Slatton, told theWashington Postthat the government has not dismissed the case against Díaz Morales, meaning deportation proceedings could still move forward despite her release. But Slatton said she remains confident that her client’s citizenship has been proven.“She is a US citizen,” Slatton told the Post. “She was born here. I think that we’ve presented more than enough evidence, but we will continue to fight it until every single court accepts and acknowledges it.”Her attorneys say that Díaz Morales entered the US to escape cartel violence in 2023 without proper paperwork and was mistakenly processed as an immigrant, placing her into deportation proceedings. They say that classification was an error.The legal team said they submitted her US birth certificate along with additional documents they say establish her citizenship – but those materials were still insufficient to secure her release from ICE custody.“In my years now of being an immigration attorney, I have never had to go this far for a case,” attorney Zachary Pérez, who also represents Díaz Morales, told WRC-TV. “What we were finally able to get and what we worked on getting was a lengthy affidavit from a medical professional, a doctor who described why the birth certificate was authentic.”A spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security told the Guardian in a statement: “Dulce Consuelo Madrigal Diaz is NOT a US citizen – she is an illegal alien from Mexico. She did NOT provide a valid US birth certificate or any evidence in support of her claim that she is a US citizen.“On December 14, ICE arrested this illegal alien in Baltimore,Maryland. On October 20, 2023, when CBP encountered her near Lukeville, Arizona, Madrigal-Diaz claimed she was a citizen of Mexico and was born on October 18, 2003,” the statement added.Díaz Morales told WRC-TV that she holds dual citizenship with Mexico and is in the process of applying for a US passport. She also said she has an upcoming check-in with immigration officials and will attend it alongside her legal team.The issue of ICE targeting US citizens has been thrown into the international spotlight after a federal agentfatally shot a womanduring a large-scale immigration enforcement action in Minneapolis.

It was then shared by the White House’s officialRapid ResponseX account as well asJD Vance, with the vice-president writing in part that he agreed with the notion that Good’s death was “a tragedy” but accused the media of dishonestly covering the circumstances of her killing.In a statement to the Guardian, the Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin confirmed that the footage was authentic while claiming that Good “was impeding law enforcement and weaponized her vehicle in an attempt to kill or cause bodily harm to federal law enforcement” and the “officer was in fear of his own life”.“The American people can watch this video with their own eyes and ears and judge for themselves,” McLaughlin added.In the footage, Good is seen being approached while in the driver’s seat of a maroon Honda Pilot stopped across a roadway while a siren blares.“That’s fine, dude,” Good can be heard saying through an open driver’s window as the agent filming the video walks in front of her car, past her open windowand to her back license plate. She continues and appears to say: “I’m not mad at you.”The masked agent’s reflection then becomes visible on the side of the car and another person’s voice can be heard saying: “Hey – show your face, big boy.” That person appears to be Good’s wife, Rebecca Good, who is then seen holding her own cellphone and heard saying: “We don’t change our plates every morning, just so you know. It will be the same plate when you come talk to us later.”That person then mentions being a US citizen and adds: “You want to come at us? You want to come at us? I say go get yourself some lunch, big boy. Go ahead.” She then turns to get into the passenger seat of Good’s car when another masked officer can then be seen approaching the driver’s side of the SUV while saying: “Get out of the car. Out of the car. Get out of the fucking car. Get out of the car.”The agent filming the video has again walked in front of Good’s car from passenger side to driver’s side. Good briefly backs up and drives forward while turning to her right as the woman with her says: “Drive, baby, drive.” The agent’s phone then abruptly points skyward, and he can be heard saying: “Whoa!”That moment of the clip is consistent with another video in circulation that shows the agent get slightly brushed by the car, which is moving so slowly that the officer is able to easily retain his balance.Gunshots then erupt without the officer putting the phone down. A voice says, “Fucking bitch,” as Good’s car briefly comes into view while it drives away. A loud crash is then heard.A dog can be seen in the back seat of Good’s SUV during the video. The animal was reportedly unhurt.The ICE agent who killed Good, an American mother of three, has beenidentifiedas Jonathan E Ross. Ross, a 10-year veteran of the special response team of ICE’s enforcement and removal operation, was taking part in an immigration sweep in Minneapolis on Wednesday at the time that he fatally shot Good. In June, Ross had beendraggedby a vehicle while participating in the arrest of an undocumented immigrant with an open ICE detainer and a criminalconvictionfor sexually assaulting his 16-year-old stepdaughter in 2022.At least some major law enforcement agencies in the US restrict officers from firing at cars coming towards them if the drivers or passengers aren’t wielding a second form of force, such as by aiming a gun at them. The purpose of such a restriction is to limit the risk of uninvolved bystanders, vehicles or buildings being struck by cars whose drivers are shot.Still, Vance asserted Friday on X that the Alpha News video from Ross’s perspective established that “his life was endangered and he fired in self-defense”.“If you want to say this woman’s death is a tragedy, that we should pray for her soul as Christians and Americans, then I agree with you,” Vance wrote in a related Xpost, after previously joining other Trump administration officials in seeking, without evidence, to portray Good as engaging in “domestic terrorism”. “But … does this law enforcement officer have a family? Yes. Did he get seriously injured by a vehicle just six months ago? Yes. Did he have a reason to fear for his life? Yes. Does he have every right to safety while he’s doing his job? Yes.”Minnesota officials and residents have met the Trump administration’s narrative of Good’s killing with sharp rebukes. Notably, the Minneapolis mayor, Jacob Frey, told ICE to “get the fuck out of” the city where a police officer murdered George Floyd in plain view of a cellphone camera five years earlier, igniting worldwide protests.Protests near the site of Good’s killing have drawn thousands while some congressional Democrats have threatened to withhold funding to the Department of Homeland Security under which ICE operates.Alpha News published Friday’s video from Ross’s perspective after the outlet’s reporter Liz Collins was a guest on Thursday’s edition of Jesse Watters Primetime, whose host is an ardent Trump supporter.Rebecca Good, meanwhile, published a statement saying: “On Wednesday, January 7th, we stopped to support our neighbors. We had whistles. They had guns. We were raising our son to believe that no matter where you come from or what you look like, all of us deserve compassion and kindness. Renee lived this belief every day. She is pure love. She is pure joy. She is pure sunshine.“Renee was a Christian who knew that all religions teach the same essential truth: we are here to love each other, care for each other, and keep each other safe and whole.”Explore more on these topicsMinnesota ICE shootingICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)MinneapolisUS politicsTrump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

A separatewebsiteappears to be set up for the opera.The Kennedy Center has been home to the WNO since it first opened in 1971.Opera leadership indicated that alternative venues withinWashington DChave been identified, though no leases have yet been finalized, the opera said in its statement.Several artists have cancelled their Kennedy Center performances in response to Trump’s takeover of the institution. In March, Hamilton producer Jeffrey Seller said in asocial media postthat “our show simply cannot, in conscience, participate and be a part of this new culture that is being imposed on the Kennedy Center”. Actor and producer Issa Rae, Grammy-winning musician Rhiannon Giddens, Peter Wolf and rock band Low Cut Connie all called off Kennedy Center performances, too.Others have reacted to Trump putting himself in charge of the institution as well. Television producer and screenwriter Shonda Rhimesresignedfrom the center’s board of trustees in February as soprano and actorRenée Flemingand singer and songwriterBen Foldsstepped down as artistic advisers.Francesca Zambello, WNO’s artistic director, hadsaid in Novemberthat the move was a possibility as a result of the “takeover” of the center by Donald Trump. Trump declared himself the chair of the institution in February and quickly thereafter fired and replaced its board and leadership.Zambello also cited the collapse in box office revenue and “shattered” donor confidence.Ticket sales were about40%unsold compared with before Trump declared himself chair, said Zambello. Many people have decided to boycott the center. Every day, she receives messages of protest from formerly loyal members of the audience, she says.“They say things like: ‘I’m never setting foot in there until the “orange menace” is gone.’ Or: ‘Don’t you know history? Don’t you know what Hitler did? I refuse to give you a penny,’” she said.“People send me back their the season brochure shredded in an envelope and say: ‘Never, never, will I return while he’s in power.’”Explore more on these topicsWashington DCOperaTrump administrationUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Earlier this week, the president suggested production in Venezuela could be boosted within 18 months.Trump plans to use Venezuela’s huge crude reserves ‘to cut US oil price to $50 a barrel’Read more“We’re going to be extracting numbers in terms of oil like few people have seen,” he said on Friday, emphasizing that the US stands to benefit from lower energy prices. “Venezuela is going to be very successful, and the people of the United States are going to be big beneficiaries.”Notably, Trump said the investment would be coming from the oil companies, not the federal government. Earlier in the week, he had suggested that the US taxpayer might fund their investments.“The plan is for them to spend, meaning our giant oil companies will be spending at least $100bn of their money, not the government’s money,” Trump said. “They don’t need government money, but they need government protection and government security.”Trump warned the assembled executives that, if they aren’t interested in rebuilding efforts: “I got 25 people that aren’t here today that are willing to take your place.”While he offered them “total safety”, the president also suggested some of the oil firms present did not need the US government’s help. “These are people that drill oil in some pretty rough places,” he said. “I could say a couple of those places make Venezuela look like a picnic.”In brief remarks, oil executives – for many, the first public statements since Maduro’s capture – expressed willingness to rebuild Venezuela’s oil infrastructure with the US government’s reassurances.Chevron “has been a part of Venezuela’s past, we are certainly committed to its present, and we very much look forward as a proud American company to help it build a better future”, said Mark Nelson, vice-chair of Chevron, currently the only US major that regularly exports Venezuelan oil.Nelson said the company currently had 3,000 employees across four different joint ventures in Venezuela and that it had the capacity to “increase our liftings from those joint ventures 100% essentially, effective immediately”.Darren Woods, Exxon’s chief executive, said the company expected “significant changes” to Venezuela’s legal and commercial landscapes in order for the company to reinvest in the country. “Today it’s uninvestable,” he said.“We’re confident that with this administration and President Trump, working hand in hand with the Venezuelan government, that those changes can be put in place,” Woods said.The ConocoPhillips CEO, Ryan Lance, echoed the cautious optimism, saying that “there’s an opportunity to be quick, fast and restore the quality of what’s been lost in Venezuela over the last 25 years”.Lance also noted that ConocoPhillips is Venezuela’s largest non-sovereign credit holder, with the country holding $12bn in debt to the company. Though Trump assured the company that it will get its money back, “we’re going to start with an even plate”.“We’re not going to look at what people lost in the past, because that was their fault. That was a different president. We’re going to make a lot of money, but we’re not going to go back,” he said.Venezuela’s oil reserves are reputedly the world’s largest. While the country’s oil industry experienced a boom in the late 90s and early 2000s, the then Venezuelan president, Hugo Chávez, eventually reasserted state control over the industry in the mid-2000s. In the years since, oil production in the country has fallen drastically as its infrastructure aged and investment dried up.Though Maduro is being tried in US federal court on “narco-terrorism” charges, Trump has been very enthusiastic about Venezuela opening back up to the American oil industry. On Wednesday, the White House said that it planned tocontrolVenezuela’s oil “indefinitely” and that it would sell billions of dollars’ worth of recently seized crude oil.History from the last two decades has shown that foreign intervention can have an impact on a country’s oil output, but withmixed and unstableresults.Oil is experiencing aglobal surplus.

In October, during thelongest US government shutdown in history, the US economy shed 173,000 jobs.Fed up: inside Trump’s unprecedented bid to exert control over the US central bankRead moreThe unemployment rate, whichrose to a four-year high of 4.6%in November, fell back to 4.4% in December.Donald Trumpwas re-elected after promising to rebuilding the US economy, which he claimed had been destroyed under predecessor Joe Biden. He also pledged to bring down prices rapidly for millions of Americans.The US president claims the economy has since taken off on his watch – and growthsurged in the third quarterof last year. But the labor market, which economists watch closely to determine the strength of the broader economy, has slowed dramatically.US employers added 584,000 over the course of 2025, the first year of Trump’s second term, according to official data. In 2024, the last year of Biden’s presidency, they added 2 million.The White House is meanwhile facing questions after Trump posted acharton his Truth Social platform on Thursday evening – ahead of the following morning’s official data release – which appeared to use data from Friday’s jobs report to show growth in private sector jobs.Bloomberg News was first toreportthe apparent embargo breach.While the president is typically briefed on the jobs data the day before its release, publicly commenting on economic data before it is officially published is an unusual breach inprotocol.In a statement to the Guardian, the White House confirmed that “there was an inadvertent public disclosure of aggregate data that was partially derived from pre-released information” and that it is “accordingly reviewing protocols regarding economic data releases”.Elizabeth Warren, a Democratic senator from Massachusetts, said: “Job growth in 2025 was the weakest in over a decade, outside of the pandemic. Instead of lowering costs like he promised, the second year of the Trump presidency is kicking off with a weaker job market and higher prices.”Economists describe the labor market as being in a “no hire, no fire” phase, in which job growth continues but remains subdued. Data from the outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmasshowedthat layoffs in December were nearly half the level of those recorded in November.A graph showing the number of jobs added to the US economy in December.After the government shutdown halted economic data collection in October and the beginning of November, December was the first month that the statistics bureau could fully collect jobs data.Federal Reserve officials are expected to weigh this data at their next policy meeting at the end of January, when they will decide whether to lower interest rates, which sit at a range of 3.5% to 3.75%, or keep them on hold.From the AI bubble to Fed fears: the global economic outlook for 2026Read moreOfficials have signaled that a pause in cuts is likely. Minutes from the board’s December meeting revealed stark division when members made their third consecutive cut to rates last month. “Some participants suggested that, under their economic outlooks, it would likely be appropriate to keep [rates] unchanged for some time,” the notes said.Samuel Tombs, the chief US economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said on Friday: “December’s labor market report is weak enough to keep the possibility of a March easing of Fed policy firmly in the mix. The sluggish headline payroll print was underpinned by a mere 37,000 increase in private payrolls.”In a press conference last month, the Fed chair, Jerome Powell, said officials would proceed with caution as they remain hopeful that the labor market will stabilize in the upcoming year and inflation will start to cool. Pricesrose2.7% in November, a cooling-off after rising 3% in September.But the Fed’s vigilance over the economy continues to clash with the outlook of Trump and his economic advisers, who have demanded lower interest rates. Cutting rates could stimulate economic growth, including bolstering the labor market, but at the risk of making prices rise faster.In a speech on Thursday, the treasury secretary, Scott Bessent,urgedthe Fed to continue cutting rates this year. “It’s the only ingredient missing for even stronger economic growth, which is why the Fed should not delay,” he said.Explore more on these topicsUS unemployment and employment statisticsInflationJerome PowellUS interest ratesUS economyUnemployment and employment statisticsEconomicsnewsShareReuse this content"

The union represents thousands of workers, from government employees to electricians, mechanics and fishers.“In Greenland, it’s hard to recognize the demands Trump is setting,” he said. “His claims about our waters being full of Russian and Chinese ships, we cannot see that at all. We can’t recognize this postulation.“The Danish navy is traveling in Greenland waters, and our big trawlers are also everywhere. If that had been the case, they could have told us already, but there’s no such thing. So what is it that he’s talking about?”10:03Is Greenland next for Donald Trump? | The LatestEuropean leaders have sought to rally behind Greenland and Denmark in recent days. “It is for Denmark and Greenland, and them only, to decide on matters concerning Denmark and Greenland,” Keir Starmer, the UK prime minister, Emmanuel Macron, the French president, and Friedrich Merz, the German chancellor,declaredin a rare European rebuke to the White House.Their statement came after Stephen Miller, Trump’s deputy chief of staff for policy, claimed during a CNN interview that “nobody” was “going to fight the United States militarily over the future of Greenland”.Berthelsen emphasized that Greenland was a semi-autonomous part of the Kingdom ofDenmark, with self-government. SIK is focused on reaching agreements with Greenland’s government and private employers to better their everyday lives, he said – and eventually work toward independence as a country.An estimated 84% of Greenlanders support independence, according to a2025 poll, which found that just 6% back a US takeover. The territory has a population of about 57,000 people.“Greenland is an autonomous part of the Kingdom of Denmark, and we have self-government, and we have agreements with the Danish government,” said Berthelsen. “That’s how things operate. If this is to change, we will take the initiative to change. It’s just hard to fathom the fact that that this is the climate among us at the moment.”US corporations, like any other company from the world, can already apply to do business in Greenland, he added. SIK has agreements with the Danish state and companies, setting terms for wages and working conditions.a map showing the US, Greenland, Denmark, Russia and ChinaCooperation between Greenland and the US was undermined by the US government making constant threats to Greenland’s autonomy, including the threat of military intervention, Berthelsen argued.“We are not for sale and that we will not be annexed,” he said. “We will determine our own future, and we will continue to work with Denmark and the United States. We have always considered the United States as our ally. That has always been so for many years.“It’s not very comfortable to receive threats from a lifelong friend, a lifelong ally. Cooperation cannot take place if we are receiving threats like these constantly. How can we cooperate when we are receiving constant threats with military intervention? Nobody does that to their friends, or people they cooperate with.”Contacted for comment, the White House deferred to a statement made by the press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, on Wednesday. “All options are always on the table for President Trump as he examines what’s in the best interest of the United States, but I will just say that the president’s first option always has been diplomacy,” she said.Explore more on these topicsGreenlandUnionsDenmarkTrump administrationDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

If a deal is agreed, it would create a global mining business with an enterprise value of more than $260bn (£193bn).The two companies said on Friday that they were in “preliminary discussions” about a “possible combination of some or all of their businesses, which could include an all-share merger”.Rio Tinto, which has an enterprise value of $162bn, said the deal under discussion would potentially result in it acquiringGlencore.Rio Tinto, founded in 1873, has about 60,000 employees across 35 countries, while Glencore – which was established in the 1970s as a trading company – has operations in more than 30 countries and a workforce of about 150,000 through employees and contractors.“The parties’ current expectation is that any merger transaction would be effected through the acquisition of Glencore by Rio Tinto by way of a court-sanctioned scheme of arrangement,” the company said in a statement. “There can be no certainty that an offer will be made or as to the terms of any such offer, should one be made.”The resumption of the talks follows the$53bn mergerof the London-listed miner Anglo American with its Canadian rival Teck in September, combining two of the world’s largest copper producers.Anglo had previously rebuffed a £39bn takeover proposal from BHP Group, while Teck rejected a buyout offer from Glencore in 2023 for £16.6bn.Copper prices hit an all-time high of more than $13,300 a tonne this week, as analysts predicted there could be a supply shortfall of as much as 10m tonnes by 2040.“Last year’s theme of consolidation in the natural resources sector has shown no sign of let-up in the early part of 2026,” said Derren Nathan, the head of equity research at Hargreaves Lansdown.“A full combination would create a global leader in multiple industrial metals including iron ore and transition metals such as copper, cobalt and lithium.” The resources are critical in theproduction of technology products, including smartphones, at the centre of the boom in AI.In December, Gary Nagle, Glencore’s chief executive, said the company’s aim was to become “the biggest copper producer in the world”. It is the world’s sixth-largest copper producer and the largest listed coal producer.Rio Tinto and Glencore held talks over a tie-up in 2024 but they failed on issues including valuation, who would run the combined company and the future of Glencore’s coalmining operations.In May, Glencore confirmed a restructure of its business to move its coal operations into a separate Australian-based entity. Rio Tinto sold its last coalmine in 2018.However, Rio is said to be open to the possibility of retaining Glencore’s coal business, according to a report by Bloomberg.Rio’s potential return to coal would follow asignificant changein the political climate towards fossil fuels.Donald Trump has led a backlash against green policies – earlier this week he pulled the US out of akey United Nations climate treaty– while large oil and gas companies have beenscrapping renewable energy targets and upping production of fossil fuels.Since the previous talks between the two companies ended, Rio has appointed a new chief executive, Simon Trott, who took over in August.“The diverse asset base and likely synergies have the potential to provide further protection against commodity price fluctuations,” said Nathan. “But just how Glencore’s coal and trading arms fit in with Rio’s business model, and push for improved sustainability credentials, are key questions to answer.”Under UK takeover rules, Rio Tinto has until 5 February to either make a formal offer for Glencore or confirm it is not proceeding with a deal.Rio is listed on the FTSE 100 and on the Australian stock exchange. Its shares fell 6% in Australia on Friday. Rio’s London listed shares closed 3% down, while Glencore’s rose by nearly 10%.Nagle, the former head of Glencore’s coal assets, took over from thelongtime boss Ivan Glasenberg in 2020. Glasenberg, who ran Glencore for 18 years, was one of ahandful of top executives to become billionairesat the company’s colossal flotation in 2011.The flotation revealed that Glasenberg had apaper fortune of almost £6bn, a figure so large thathis 3,600 neighboursin the Swiss village of Rüschlikon received a tax cut.Glasenberg’s close lieutenants, Daniel Maté, Telis Mistakidis, Tor Peterson and Alex Beard, all owned stakes worth about £2bn at that time.Glencore wasfounded in 1974by the metals trader Marc Rich but, in 1983, he was indicted on charges described by the then US attorney for New York, Rudy Giuliani, as“the biggest tax evasion case in United States history”.In December, Glencore’s Nagle said that the mining industry needed to further consolidate “not just for the sake of size, but also to create material synergies, to create relevance, to attract talent, to attract capital”.In 2007, Rio Tinto bought Canada’s Alcan to create the biggest producer of aluminium in the world, a move to diversify beyond its core iron ore and copper businesses.In the same year, Freeport-McMoRan completed its acquisition of Phelps Dodge Corp to form the world’s largest publicly traded copper company.Five years later, Glencore agreed an all-share takeover of the Switzerland-headquartered Xstrata, beating a hostile bid from Aloca, creating a commodities conglomerate spanning mining, agriculture, oil and trading.In 2023, Newmont, the world’s largest goldminer, acquired Australia’s biggest gold producer, NewcrestMining.Explore more on these topicsMiningMergers and acquisitionsRio TintoGlencorenewsShareReuse this content"

That costs taxpayers approximately $10bn in compensation for workers who were staying home and not working.Peer alleges theTrump administrationviolated the law with extended paid leaves, but enforcement is complicated. It would require navigating a complex administrative or legal process, or a US attorney with the Donald Trump-controlled Department of Justice to pursue criminal charges.‘They sowed chaos to no avail’: the lasting legacy of Elon Musk’s DogeRead more“Spending over $10bn of taxpayer money to prevent people from working is a hell of a way to run a railroad,” said Peer senior counsel Peter Jenkins.“Ironically, this outrageous waste of human capital – when key federal agencies such as the National Park Service were horribly understaffed – was done in the name of government efficiency.”Among others on paid leave are US Environmental Protection Agencyenvironmental justice employees, who are stuck in legal limbo.There are few legal remedies in part because of the labyrinthine regulatory process that involves multiple interchanging parts across various laws and oversight bodies, and because the Trump administration has taken legally questionable steps to hamstring the response and protect its paid leave operation. That has culminated in an “accountability black hole”, said Madeline Materna, a Stanford University doctoral student in comparative science who studiesthe issue.Until 2016, federal agencies sometimes used administrative leave as a way to punish employees with whom they had a problem, like whistleblowers. Some were put on involuntary leave for years without recourse.Peer lobbied for laws to prevent this strategy, and Congress in 2016 passed the Administrative Leave Act (ALA), which limits imposition of paid leave to no more than 10 workdays in any calendar year, with very limited exceptions.The Trump paid leave strategy seems to be a clear violation of the ALA, but the first Trump administration did not implement the ALA’s specific regulatory rules that agencies have to follow. Opposition from agencies’ management impeded implementation during Joe Biden’s administration, which also did not develop the rules untilPeer suedin 2024, said Jeff Ruch, senior counsel at Peer.The regulatory rules did not go into effect until September 2025, which complicated ALA enforcement, even if the extended paid leaves seemed to clearly violate the law.The Trump administration carved out separate classifications of paid leave, and claimed the ALA 10-day rule only applies to what it calls “investigative” paid leave, Materna said. But the provision does not apply to the various other types of paid leave the administration has created.The classifications “totally gut the law”, Materna said. “They did not lawfully implement Congress’s statue, they did something else.Meanwhile, the Anti-Deficiency Act prohibits the government from spending money on employees who should not be on leave, because Congress did not appropriate the funds for purposes related to the paid leave program.The first step to accountability lies in Peer’s complaint with theGovernment Accountability Office. The GAO must opine that the paid leave is a violation of the law, and agency heads who violate the rules can be criminally prosecuted, removed from office, and fined.That, however, would require a “US attorney armed with a profile in courage because they would be prosecuting their own administration”, Ruch said. “It’s not a nonstarter, but it’s unlikely.”We still don’t really know what Elon Musk’s Doge actually didRead moreMaterna said criminal prosecution is also complicated because agency managers must knowingly violate the law, and they could argue that they have been following the rules that were implemented.Peer has filed an administrative complaint before the US Office of Special Counsel. If that office finds wrongdoing, the cases could be taken before a little-known office called the Merit Systems Protection Board. It has authority to take action, but Ruch said it hears cases involving termination, demotion or suspension without pay for two weeks. It may not have jurisdiction over paid leave cases.Notably, the Trump administration fired all Democrats on the board, which has left it without a quorum.A federal lawsuit over the administration’s legally questionable implementation of the ALA rules is possible, but only if a plaintiff can show that they were harmed by the rules’ implementation, Materna said. A hypothetical plaintiff would have to get a favorable ruling from the Merit Systems Protection Board to have standing for a lawsuit. But the barriers to the Merit Systems Protection Board make that virtually impossible.“There’s clever dancing around the law, and things that make it challenging to take the issue to court or any regulatory body, and that’s why [the paid leave program] has been allowed to proceed,” Materna said.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationUS politicsDonald TrumpElon MusknewsShareReuse this content"

We’re not asking to strike. Management is the one who’s telling us that we need to strike. They are the ones putting us on the picket line.”She cited safety issues that stem from a drastic increase of assaults on healthcare workers since the Covid-19 pandemic, and an active shooter incident at Mount Sinai last November, where three nurses werereportedly disciplinedfor speaking out afterwards.“The large, wealthy hospitals are much better off financially than they were three years ago, but yet they’re asking for takeaways,” claimed Hagans. “They told us to choose between our wages or keeping our healthcare and safe staffing, because we cannot have it all. The safety of a patient should never be a bargaining chip. Nurses will not cut corners on patients and their safety. Nurses are just demanding that New York City private hospitals put patients over profit.”Nursesrepresentedby NYSNA issued 10-day strike notices on 2 January at a string of New York hospitals. On Tuesday, seven of the smaller hospitals moved forward in contract negotiations, with the union rescinding their strike notice.About 1,000 nursesat three Northwell hospitals in Long Island have alsoissuedstrike notices.“Our nurses have been at the bargaining table since September 2025 with little to no movement,” said Simone Way, a member of the NYSNA executive committee, and a nurse at Mount Sinai Morningside hospital. “Even though we started this process in September, there have been committees in the hospital having these same discussions on staffing since January 2025, so it’s no surprise to our management the things nurses feel we need.”‘A state of crisis’: record number of Americans are pessimistic about US healthcare systemRead moreWay also criticized hospital management’s efforts to blame the strike on nurses, claiming they are putting patients at risk and asking for too much. “They do have the money, but they don’t appear to be willing to invest that money in their nurses or into the ability for us to provide the best care humanly possible to our patients,” she said.Mount Sinai denied retaliation claims against nurses following November’s active-shooter incident, and denied attempting to take away healthcare benefits for nurses. A spokesperson said: “We are continuing to bargain in good faith in the hopes of reaching an agreement that is fair, reasonable, and responsible, but unfortunately just a week before a potential strike NYSNA has refused to move off of its extreme economic proposals that demand hospitals like ours spend billions of dollars on increased nursing compensation and additional hires.”They claimed “most of the union’s claims about bargaining are untrue”, and confirmed that the hospital was taking steps to prepare in case of a strike.New York Presbyterian blamed the union for not budging on wages. “NYSNA’s threatened strike is intended to disrupt patient care across the city,” a spokesperson said. “We have taken the necessary steps to ensure that our patients will continue to receive safe, exceptional care. We will always meet our fundamental obligation to the communities we serve.”Montefiore did not respond to requests for comment.Explore more on these topicsNew YorkNursingUS unionsHealthHealthcare industryUS healthcarenewsShareReuse this content"

Their defense was nauseating, and nobody wants a playoff weekend spoiled watching that. But their offense was electric. They finished fifth in the league in EPA/play in the regular season. And with Dak Prescott, a solid o-line and George Pickens and CeeDee Lamb, they had the potential to drop 30 points on any playoff group. If they’d snuck in and managed to knock off a top seed, it would have convinced Jerry Jones that he was on the right path. And nothing is funnier than Jones failing to recognize that the reason why Dallas is stuck is the reflection in his mirror.Oliver ConnollyKansas City Chiefs.Patrick Mahomes has defined the NFL’s January rhythm for nearly a decade. With his ACL tear punctuatingthe Chiefs’ annus horribilis, the playoffs lost their most creative force and familiar reference point, leaving this year’s tournament the most wide-open in recent memory.Bryan Armen GrahamKicking zones and a ban on losing teams: NFL playoff tweaks we’d like to seeRead moreDetroit Lions.No defender in the postseason disrupts a game like Aidan Hutchinson, who had a career season. While the Lions regressed in some areas this season, they have a collection of dynamic playmakers. Their four losses to playoff teams since November were each by less than one score, highlighting Detroit’s competitiveness.Melissa JacobsJoe Burrow, a quarterback with finesse and two dynamite receivers – Ja’Marr Chase and Tee Higgins – is someone you wish was locking horns with this season’s best. That trio is what the playoffs need, shame about the rest of theCincinnati Bengals.Graham SearlesHigh-seeded team at risk of going out earlyThe gap between the No 2 seed and No 7 seed in the NFC is slim. And theChicago Bearsare reliant on turnovers to get off the field on defense. Their four-man pass-rush group, the key to postseason success, ranks 31st in the league in pressure rateandhas the slowest average time to pressure. With Caleb Williams and Ben Johnson, they’re a fun, explosive team – and a joy to watch. But relying on turnovers to survive is rarely sustainable.OCNew England Patriots.Drake Maye has played at an MVP level, but a 14-3 record built on a soft schedule can flatter to deceive. In the playoffs, protection issues and a lack of battle-tested weapons could surface quickly against a physical, well-coached opponent with a disruptive pass rush.BAGTheChicago Bearshave had a rebirth in Johnson’s first year in charge. He has transformed Williams, given the offense a shrewd playbook, and isliving his best life in the process. It’s comparable to Jim Harbaugh’s first year in San Francisco, with one major exception. Have you seen Chicago’s defense? 24.4 points allowed per game is the most by any team in the postseason.MJDenver Broncos. Sean Payton is happy to have his offense avoid turning the ball over while scoring just enough to let his monstrous defense carry the day. That’s a great plan against weaker opponents (only New England had a softer strength of schedule this season). But when the Broncos faced a Super Bowl contender in the Jaguars last month they came up short. If the Broncos face the Texans, who are armed with a defense better than either Denver’s or Jacksonville’s quality unit, in the divisional round they will test whether the Jags flub was the Broncos’ real level or an aberration.GS2025 NFL playoffs bracketLong shot to winWhat counts as a long shot this season? No team feels complete. Even the No 1 seeds have pretty pronounced flaws. But let’s go with theHoustonTexans.They have a dominant four-man pass-rush, the hallmark of Super Bowl champions. There is a world in which the offense is goodenoughto keep games close, with CJ Stroud taking over in key spots and putting together a legacy stretch.OCLos Angeles Chargers.They may have slipped in as the No 7 seed, but a Jim Harbaugh team with an elite quarterback is never a comfortable draw. The Chargers’ combination of coaching experience and high-end quarterback play gives them real spoiler potential in an AFC bracket ripe for disruption.BAGIt’s weird to consider theBuffalo Billsa long shot, but they’re the No 6 seed and nothing about this season has been expected. The path to the Super Bowl will be harder than ever, starting with the fact that Buffalo haven’t won a road playoff game since the 1992 season. This weekend the Bills travel to Jacksonville – the NFL’s hottest team – with virtually no receivers of note, an inept run defense, and major issues with their kicking game. But they have Josh Allen and a boatload of playoff experience. Other AFC teams look better on paper, but the postseason is a whole different ballgame.MJThePittsburgh Steelershave been a rough watch at times this season, so they could easily flame out. But the returning DK Metcalf could dominate if Aaron Rodgers can lock in at his belligerent best. The Steelers have a more clear X-factor in the experience of head coach Mike Tomlin though. He can galvanise a defense that at times has been very good.GSView image in fullscreenJosh Allen’s dynamic play will keep the Bills in games.Photograph: Gene J Puskar/APMost important player this postseasonJosh Allen, QB, Buffalo Bills.The AFC is wide open. But the Bills are rolling with the best, most proven player in the field (with apologies to Maye, who should be this year’s MVP). The Bills are flawed; they have been awful in the first half of games and played at a championship-level in the second half; their run defense is a sieve; and they’ve never won a road playoff game (0-5) with Sean McDermott as head coach. But if they’re going to win multiple rounds, it will be Allen reminding us he’s the best all-around player in the league.OCLane Johnson, RT,Philadelphia Eagles.The first-ballot Hall of Famer has been Philly’s best player for more than a decade; the Eagles are 110-57-1 (.658) when he plays and 18-27 (.400) when he doesn’t. Expected to return from a Lisfranc sprain that has sidelined him since November, his presence (if truly fit) stabilizes everything from Jalen Hurts’ protection to what’s been a inconsistent run game, making him the clearest swing factor in the Eagles’ repeat bid.BAGSam Darnold, QB, Seattle Seahawks.Will the postseason pumpkin return for Darnold? It was just about this time last year when Darnold, then the Vikings quarterback, had his worst performance of the seasonin the wildcard round. Darnold was sackedninetimes, several of those came when he held on to the ball for too long. Darnold has again been a regular season gem this time around, topping 4,000 yards and shining when it matters most. He has, however, thrown 14 interceptions, third behind only Tua Tagovailoa and Geno Smith. He’ll need to step up in the playoffs if he’s to alter the nagging doubts around his game.MJJosh Allen, QB, Buffalo Bills.Epic back-to-back comeback wins in December over the Bengals and Patriots highlighted the extent to which Buffalo’s talisman can drag them from the mire. No lead is safe with Allen in full flow.GSAFC Championship GameJaguars over Texans.OCJaguars over Broncos.BAGBroncos over Bills.MJPatriots over Texans.GSNFC Championship GameRams over Eagles.OCRams over Seahawks.BAGRams over Eagles.MJSeahawks over Eagles.GSYour Super Bowl champion will be …Rams over Jaguars.LA have every ingredient to sweep through the playoffs: an MVP-level quarterback, a dynamic pass-rush, elite coaching and a quality offensive line. They have fewer question marks than any team in the field. Theonlyflaws are in their secondary and on special teams. But they’re healthier on the back-end now, and they’ve switched out their special teams coordinator. Plus, no other team can win in such a variety of ways. If it’s a rock fight, they have the defensive front. If it’s a shootout, they have the weapons on offense. It’s tough to pick against the Seahawks – and a Jags title would be exceptional – but the Rams are the most complete team.OCJaguars over Rams.Trevor Lawrence caps Jacksonville’s rapid rise by matching and then surpassing Matthew Stafford when it matters most. In a Super Bowl decided in the margins, the Jaguars’ defense and poise late provide the separation, confirming this run as a breakthrough rather than a premature arrival. Jason Mendozarejoices.BAGRams over Broncos.At their best, the Rams dominate both sides of the ball. Stafford is playing the best football of his life. Sean McVay has a track record of winning tough playoff games on the road. Denver will be at home until the craziness of Super Bowl week, which can throw even great teams atilt. The Rams also are getting key players back at the right time including LT Alaric Jackson and WR Davante Adams. But ultimately it will be the Rams’ underrated run defense that will hold the Broncos down.MJPatriots over Seahawks.Chaos will grip the playoffs. It has to after the mad 18 weeks we have just witnessed. And yet the body of work these franchises have put together inspires confidence that they can fight through the wreckage. Seattle run a defense mean enough to win it all while New England are blessed with a diamond quarterback in Maye driving the most explosive passing attack in theNFL. It would be a spectacular chess match, one that the likely MVP, Maye, will conquer.GSExplore more on these topicsNFLUS sportsSuper Bowl LXLos Angeles RamsNew England PatriotsBuffalo BillsJacksonville JaguarsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It will now run from 15 to 17 June, a change that has been reflected on the G7’s official website.Trump loomed over sport like never before in 2025. Next year he will take even moreRead moreThe shift follows Trump’s announcement last October that the White House would host a “bigUFCfight” on 14 June. Dana White, the president and chief executive of the UFC, mixed martial arts’ biggest promotion, said this week that planning for the event is complete and that it is expected to draw up to 5,000 spectators on the White House South Lawn.Asked about the change in dates, the office of French president Emmanuel Macron declined to confirm whether it was linked to the UFC event, saying instead that the revised schedule was “the result of our consultations with G7 partners”. The possibility that the summit could be moved because of Trump’s birthday celebrationswas first reportedby the French regional outlet Le Messager.The rescheduling underscoresthe tightly knit relationshipbetween Trump and White, which dates back more than two decades. In 2001, when the UFC was struggling for mainstream acceptance and was barred from hosting events in many US states, Trump allowed the promotion to stage fights at his Trump Taj Mahal casino in Atlantic City, providing it with early exposure and a foothold in regulated markets.Trump has since become a regular presence at UFC events, often sitting cageside for entire cards and using the appearances as high-profile public moments. He attended UFC events after leaving office in 2021 and later made similar appearances amid legal proceedings, receiving enthusiastic receptions from crowds. White, meanwhile, has publicly praised Trump’s loyalty and has appeared alongside him at political events includingthe past three Republican national conventions.View image in fullscreenDana White, Donald Trump and Kid Rock pose for a photo at a UFC event at Madison Square Garden.Photograph: Chris Unger/Zuffa LLC/Getty ImagesIn recent years, the UFC has also become an important platformfor Trump’s outreach to younger male voters, a demographic that played a key role in his return to the White House. White has helped facilitate Trump’s appearances on popular podcasts and digital shows closely associated with the promotion and its fan base, amplifying his presence in online spaces that reach millions of viewers.Since beginning his second term, Trump has further embraced the UFC as part of a broader blending of politics, sport and spectacle. He has attended multiple events with senior administration officials, invited White to the White House and promoted plans for the 14 June card – on day four of theFifa World Cup– as a centerpiece of America’s 250th anniversary celebrations.UFC landed a $7.7bn deal with Paramount. But is Dana White’s Trump bond a liability?Read moreWhite, whowas appointed to Meta’s board of directorslast year, has said he does not hold an official role in the administration and has described himself as politically independent. Still, critics argue the UFC hasaligned itself with Trump’s political movement, adopting its tone and aesthetics and serving as a reliable stage for the president’s public appearances.For France and itsG7partners, the decision to shift the summit by a day avoids a diplomatic collision with a highly publicized event at the White House and reflects how Trump’s presidency has increasingly merged governance with political branding and entertainment.Whitetold CBS News on Thursdaythat the UFC has completed the logistical groundwork for staging the card, including seating, staging and security, after months of coordination with federal authorities. The event is expected to accommodate an invite-only crowd of spectators on the South Lawn, with a larger adjacent viewing area for up to 85,000 fans in the Ellipse park just south of the property.“We literally just got done going through all of the logistics of how to set it up, how many people we can have,” White said. “It’s looking like we’ll have 5,000 people live on the White House lawn. It’ll be on the South Lawn.” White added that fighters would make a ceremonial walk from the White House to the octagon, underlining the event’s symbolism as well as its scale.Matchmaking for the event has not yet been announced though White has said work on the lineup will begin in the coming weeks. While several prominent MMA fighters have publicly expressed interest in competing on the card, ithas also drawn criticismfrom within the sport, including concerns about the structure of the fight slate and the challenges of staging a one-off event at a politically sensitive venue.Trump’s rear naked choke hold on the world diplomatic calendar comes at a time when the presidencyhas become increasingly entwined with sport. Since the start of his second term, Trump has made frequent appearances at major sporting events across the US, using high-profile venues and broadcast moments to project visibility and relevance beyond traditional political settings.Explore more on these topicsUFCMMAG7Donald TrumpFranceEmmanuel MacronUS sportsShareReuse this content"

The ban takes effect immediately and would apply if Kepler signs with a team during the 2026 season.Trump loomed over baseball’s Hall of Fame. But voters still said no to Bonds and ClemensRead moreKepler, who turns 33 next month, is an 11-year major league veteran who spent the first decade of his career with the Minnesota Twins before joining thePhiladelphia Phillieslast season. As a free agent, he was not under contract at the time of the announcement but remains subject to the league’s drug program.In a statement, MLB said the suspension was issued following a violation of its jointly administered drug policy with the Major League Baseball Players Association. The league did not provide further details about the circumstances of the test or whether Kepler intends to appeal.Epitrenbolone has been linked to past anti-doping cases across professional sports. In 2018, the substance was cited in the suspension of heavyweight boxer Manuel Charr after a positive test halted his title defense. It was alsoat the center of a US Anti-Doping Agency caseinvolving a 90-year-old American cyclist who was stripped of a masters world record in 2020.Kepler, a native of Berlin who holds the MLB career record for home runs by a German-born player, debuted with the Twins in 2015 and emerged as a fixture in their outfield, known for his left-handed power and steady defense. He was a key contributor to multiple postseason teams in Minnesota, including the club’s division-winning seasons in 2019 and 2020.An 80-game suspension is the standard penalty for a first offense under MLB’s drug program involving performance-enhancing substances. Players suspended under the policy are ineligible to participate in regular-season games or the postseason during the suspension period and do not receive pay.Explore more on these topicsMLBDrugs in sportBaseballUS sportsPhiladelphia PhilliesShareReuse this content"

For four games they had played scratchy, crabbed football. Finally, in a spiky, ill-tempered quarter-final, there was something more like the Morocco that reached the semi-finals of the World Cup two years ago. If the game wasn’t fluent, that was largely Cameroon’s doing as they spoiled and delayed and sought treatment for injuries. But the hosts, for the most part, retained their cool, protecting a lead earned with verve in the first half with maturity in the second.In previous games, Morocco had looked tense, limbs leadened by the expectation of a country that last won the Cup of Nations 50 years ago and that has spent a vast amount on football-related infrastructure as it prepares to co-host the 2030 World Cup. The coach, Walid Regragui, was even booed in the last-16 victory over Tanzania, his football deemed overly cautious despite a record of only four defeats in his 46 games as national coach before this quarter-final. “I always say that we are a family,” said Regragui. “Even if many people don’t believe in us or in me … that’s OK. We play for the country and for the supporters who want to see Morocco at the top.”Victor Osimhen’s volatile temperament risks harming Nigeria’s Afcon questRead moreImages from the respective dressing rooms showed Morocco pensive and focused while Cameroon sang and danced. But once the game had begun, there was none of the anxiety that had previously characterised their play. Fuelled by an extremely noisy crowd in the magnificent Stade Prince Moulay Abdallah, they pressed ferociously from the off, winning a series of set plays as Cameroon did whatever they could to break the flow of the game. Regragui described it as their best first half since the friendly win over Brazil in October. Ayoub El Kaabi got to Morocco’s sixth corner of the game and headed down towards the back post where Brahim Díaz nudged in his fifth goal of the tournament.Another set play brought the second with 16 minutes remaining, Ismael Saibari slamming in an angled shot after a free-kick had dropped to him at the back post.Cameroon, in obvious contrast to the hosts, arrived at the tournament with less expectation than perhaps ever before, given a chaotic buildup in which two rival coaches each submitted squad lists to CAF. In the end, as Samuel Eto’o, the president of the federation, won his battle with the sports ministry, his candidate David Pagou prevailed. Pagou, a 56-year-old experienced in the Cameroonian league, has proved a punchy and drily amusing figure, his delivery in press conferences as direct as the play of his young and highly motivated side.They have performed far better in this tournament than most had anticipated, their speed and coherence justifying a selection policy that culled many of the older players. But here they looked, if not overawed by the occasion, then certainly overwhelmed early on by the pace and aggression of Morocco. The suspicion is most teams in this competition would be. Regragui started the same line-up as had begun against Tanzania, a 4-3-3 that gives the wide forwards, Díaz and Ez Abde, more freedom. Familiarity, perhaps, brought fluency; certainly they appear a more mobile side without Sofyan Amrabat.View image in fullscreenIsmael Saibari scores his team’s second goal during the Africa Cup of Nations quarter-final against Cameroon.Photograph: Gabriel Bouys/AFP/Getty ImagesThe Mauritanian referee Dahane Beida, who took charge of the final in Côte d’Ivoire two years ago, was confirmed as the referee for the game only on Thursday after the Moroccan football federation protested against the appointment of the Egyptian Amin Omar. Cameroon were furious at the late change, and were upset with a number of Beida’s decisions, but he wasn’t the reason Cameroon lost. Pagour refused to blame him, speaking only of “challenging” circumstances.For those countries who have qualified for the World Cup, a Cup of Nations six months before the main event is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, it’s a great opportunity for fine-tuning in a competitive environment. On the other, as demonstrated by the case of Sami Trabelsi, sacked by Tunisia after last week’s exit to Mali, it only takes a couple of poor performances in competitive games for the goodwill generated in qualifying to be forgotten.Given his record, it seems absurd that Regragui should be under pressure but, if Morocco do not win the Cup of Nations, there’s a very good chance he will be replaced before the World Cup, perhaps by Tarik Sektioui, who led what was effectively a B-team to glory in the Arab Cup in December.Will they win it? Morocco could probably still do with a little more goal threat, but this was a tight victory very different from the narrow win over Tanzania in the last round. This was less about nerves than about getting a lead and then holding a dangerous opponent at arm’s length. The way they pressed in the first half then sat off in the second, two wholly different approaches, was hugely impressive. They looked potential champions at last.Explore more on these topicsAfrica Cup of Nations 2025Cameroon football teamMorocco football teamAfrica Cup of Nationsmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

The club the Hollywood actor invested in were just about underdogs against Premier LeagueNottingham Forestin a game that included numerous plot twists, only to provide the romantic ending the majority wanted.The heroic Okonkwo saved from Igor Jesus and Omari Hutchinson in the shootout to ensure James McClean’s miss was irrelevant. It should have been easier for ­Wrexham, who had a two-goal lead at 3-1 before Callum Hudson-Odoi’s double forced extra time on an energy-sapping and freezing night.Wrexham v Nottingham Forest: FA Cup third round – liveRead more“It was an entertaining game, probably a bit too entertaining at times for both managers,” Wrexham’s Phil Parkinson said. “This is a great night. We highlighted to the lads some of the great moments in this club’s history in theFA Cupand could we make our own bit of history tonight. We’ve certainly done that, in a tough game against a very good side in Forest.”The outcome was, arguably, ideal for both sides, although neither would have welcomed the requirement of 30 extra minutes. Wrexham completed a fifth consecutive victory to help build momentum as they seek promotion to the top flight. Forest can now focus on a relegation battle and the Europa League knockout stages, while manager Sean Dyche is also able to show the club hierarchy that he cannot rely on his fringe players.“The first half’s the frustrating bit,” Dyche said. “Completely unacceptable, miles off. Players who have got a platform to come and play and show me what their worth is to themselves, first of all, and the team and they didn’t do that. I thought it was miles off and absolutely unacceptable.”View image in fullscreenThe New Zealand defender Liberato Cacace opens the scoring with help from a small deflection to send the Wrexham fans into raptures.Photograph: Oli Scarff/AFP/Getty ImagesForest started brighter after making eight changes, looking composed on the ball but without any level of incision in the final third. Wrexham were happy to sit back against a sluggish side unable to find a rhythm. Douglas Luiz rightly had a goal disallowed for handball in an otherwise forgettable half for the visitors.Wrexham were aided by Forest making numerous mistakes in possession. The New Zealand international Liberato Cacace capitalised after Hutchinson lost the ball on the edge of his own box and fired into the corner for his first goal in English football, much to the delight of a vociferous home support.Three minutes later the lead was doubled, thanks to more loose Forest play. Wrexham were sharp, winning it in their opponent’s half again, Nathan Broadhead fizzed the ball towards the edge of the box, picking out Ollie Rathbone, who got a lucky ricochet before calmly slotting home.Quick GuideWigan shock Championship highflyers PrestonShowThere was an FA Cup third round upset at Deepdale, where Championship high-flyers Preston lost 1-0 to League One Wigan thanks to teenager Harrison Bettoni's strike.The 18-year-old saw his 75th-minute shot loop into the net via a deflection off substitute Andrew Hughes and, although Callum Wright missed a late penalty to make it 2-0, Wigan manager Ryan Lowe got one over on his former employers.Oxford are into the fourth round but only after the Championship strugglers edged out League Two MK Dons on penalties following a 1-1 draw.Aaron Collins put the Dons ahead before Will Lankshear equalised for the visitors, and misses from the spot by Jonathan Leko and Connor Lemonheigh-Evans won the tie for Oxford, who are into the fourth round for the first time since 2020.They were watched by Matt Bloomfield, who was announced as Oxford head coach a few hours before kick-off, while interim boss Craig Short took charge.Jon Brady's first game in charge of Port Vale ended in victory as they defeated Fleetwood 1-0. Jordan Shipley struck in stoppage time at the end of the first half to take Port Vale past this stage of the competition for the first time since 2013-14.Vale are bottom of League Two but have won both games since the departure of Darren Moore.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.“Premier League, you’re a having a laugh” was the piercing and deserved chant aimed at Dyche on the touchline. The Forest manager made a triple change at the break in search of improvement from his regulars. ­Morgan Gibbs-White raised the tempo after his introduction but it felt like he was doing it alone.Igor Jesus spent the night isolated but did reduce the deficit with a header in the 64th minute. After that Forest were in the ascendancy and looking for an equaliser with Wrexham being pushed back but the ­Premier League club’s defensive frailties came to the fore. They gave away a needless free-kick, which Dom Hyam headed home at the far post to make it 3-1 and give the impression the upset was complete.View image in fullscreenCallum Hudson-Odoi celebrates after his brilliant second goal took the game to extra time.Photograph: Nick Potts/PAHudson-Odoi, recently off the bench, had other ideas. An instinctive first-time finish reduced the deficit but it looked to be in vain until he superbly chested the ball down and caressed home in the 89th minute to finally silence the home fans.As the temperatures dropped below zero, Forest had sustained pressure in extra time but without creating a clear-cut opportunity. Josh Windass could have won it when through one on one but goalkeeper Matz Sels was alert, sending everyone to a test of nerves in the shootout.When McClean smashed into the stands, Forest had their chance but Okonkwo was unwilling to let reputations win the night, saving immediately from Igor Jesus. “Arthur is a colossus, he’s such a presence in the goal, you always feel you have a chance,” Parkinson said with understatement. “ I want them to soak up the feeling of the achievement of tonight and come back in on Monday, ready to focus on our league campaign next week.”Explore more on these topicsFA CupWrexhamNottingham Forestmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

They will face either top-ranked Indiana or No 5 Oregon in the national title game on 19 January.Miami held Texas A&M and reigning national champion Ohio State to a combined 17 points to reach the CFP semi-finals. Then the Hurricanes shut down the high-scoring Rebels (13-2) for three quarters in the desert before pulling it out in a wild fourth.Malachi Toney, hero of Miami’s opening CFP win over Texas A&M, turned a screen pass into a 36-yard touchdown that put the Hurricanes up 24-19.Trinidad Chambliss, a year removed from winning a Division II title at Ferris State, led the Rebels down the field and found Dae’Quan Wright for a 24-yard touchdown with 3:13 left.Then it was Beck’s turn.He won a national title as a backup at Georgia before two productive seasons as the Bulldogs’ starter. Beck kept the Hurricanes calm amid the storm, leading them down the field for the winning score – and a shot at a national title on their home field at Hard Rock Stadium. Beck is 37-5 as a starter, including two seasons at Georgia.“He’s hungry, he’s driven, he’s a great human being, and all he wants to do is to see his teammates have success,” said Mario Cristobal, in his fourth season coaching his alma mater. “And that’s what we witnessed tonight.”Chambliss completed two passes to get Ole Miss to the Miami 35 with six seconds left, but his heave to the end zone fell incomplete as time expired.The sixth-seeded Rebels lost their coach before the playoff, but not their cool.View image in fullscreenMalachi Toney of the Miami Hurricanes carries the ball after a reception for a touchdown against the Ole Miss Rebels in the fourth quarter of Thursday’s game.Photograph: Christian Petersen/Getty ImagesIf anything, Lane Kiffin’s decision to bolt for LSU seemed to harden Ole Miss’ resolve, pushing the Rebels to the best season in school history – and within a game of their first national championship game.Ole Miss took the lead on Lucas Caneiro’s fourth field goal, from 21 yards, and seemed poised to continue its improbable run with Chambliss’ TD pass to Wright.The Rebels couldn’t hold back the Hurricanes on their final drive, but what a run it was.With Pete Golding calling the shots after being promoted from defensive coordinator to head coach, and most of the assistants sticking around, the Rebels blew out Tulane to open the playoff and took down mighty Georgia in the CFP quarterfinals.They faced a different kind of storm in the Hurricanes.Miami has rekindled memories of its 2001 national championship team behind a defense that went from porous to nearly impenetrable in its first season under coordinator Corey Hetherman.The Hurricanes walled up early in the Fiesta Bowl, holding Ole Miss to minus-1 yard.One play revved up the Rebels and their rowdy fans.Kewan Lacy, the nation’s third-leading rusher, burst through a hole up the middle for a 73-yard touchdown run on the first play of the second quarter – the longest run allowed by Miami’s defense since 2018.The Hurricanes seemed content to grind away at the Rebels in small chunks offensively, setting up CharMar Brown’s four-yard touchdown run and a field goal.Miami unlocked the deep game just before halftime, taking advantage of a busted coverage for a 52-yard touchdown pass from Beck to Keelan Marion.Explore more on these topicsCollege footballCollege sportsUS sportsmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

I didn’t know I was able to skate that complete, that good,” Malinin said.Malinin said he briefly weighed a more conservative approach but abandoned it once he stepped onto the ice.“I felt really good and everything flowed really well so I said let’s go for what I originally planned,” he said.Malinin was not selected for the US team four years ago and he has used that as fuel to become a singular force in figure skatingsimilar to Simone Biles’ dominance in gymnastics.“That was such a hard moment for me to go through but it made me the skater I am today,” he said.An emotional moment came when Maxim Naumov held up and kissed a picture of himself as a child holding hands with his parents, who died nearly a year ago in a mid-air collision between their American Airlines flight and an army helicopter over Washington DC.The jet was carrying 28 US figure skating athletes, coaches, and family members returning from a development camp including Naumov’s parents Vadim Naumov and Evgenia Shishkova, the 1994 world champions in pairs.Chock and Bates leadEarlier, Madison Chock and Evan Bates moved into position to win a record seventh ice dance title with a rhythm dance performance that showed why they are the gold medal favourites at next month’s Winter Olympics.Dancing to a medley of Lenny Kravitz hits, the married couple showcased the fluidity, connection and strong rotational lifts they hope will deliver them their first Olympic gold medal in their individual discipline.Both of their mothers were in the stands in St Louis and shed tears of joy after the performance, which was awarded a 91.70 by the judges, putting them ahead of Emilea Zingas and Vadym Kolesnik (85.98) and Christina Carreira and Anthony Ponomarenko (83.29) with the free dance to come on Saturday.The top three finishers will earn spots on the US team for the Milano Cortina Games.“It has been the best journey. I remember the day Maddie said she wanted to skate with me, it was one of the best days of my life,” said Bates, who won gold with Chock in the team event at the Beijing Games four years ago.“But I don’t think either of us would have ever guessed that we would continue for 15 years or end up marrying each other and certainly not going for a seventh title, so it’s all been the most rewarding journey.“The three-times world champions have suggested that next month’s Games, which will be the pair’s fourth, could be their last.Explore more on these topicsFigure skatingIlia MalininUS sportsUSA Olympic teamShareReuse this content"

Saka said before the Champions League quarter-final victory against Real Madrid in April that he wanted to “win wearing this badge” but also said he was in “no rush” to sign a new contract.Renée Slegers ‘immensely proud’ after signing new three-year deal at ArsenalRead moreArsenal’s sporting director, Andrea Berta, made it a priority to secure the future of the Hale End academy graduate after tying down Gabriel Magalhães, William Saliba, Ethan Nwaneri and Myles Lewis-Skelly to long-term contracts last year. Saka’s representatives have agreed a deal that will run until 2031, when Saka will be approaching his 30th birthday, with confirmation expected soon fromArsenal.It is understood the deal is likely to take his earnings beyond £15m a season – the equivalent of about £300,000 a week – and into an elite bracket of players in Europe that Arsenal believe represents the 24-year-old’s importance. At present, Kai Havertz is thought to be their best-paid player, having signed a contract worth £280,000 a week when he joined from Chelsea in 2023. Mesut Özil earned a reported £350,000 a week at Arsenal after he signed a contract extension in 2018.Saka has been outstanding in recent weeks as Arsenal have established a six-point lead at the top of the Premier League and is benefiting from the signing of Noni Madueke from Chelsea as back-up on the right. Saka’s minutes have been carefully managed since he sustained a minor hamstring injury in August and Saka has started on the bench against Club Brugge, Brentford and Bournemouth since the start of December.In September, manager Mikel Arteta said he washopeful that Saka would commit his futureto the club the player joined as a seven-year-old. “I would love that,” he said. “From everything that I know, again he’s a player that is extremely happy and proud to be [here] and to have the role that he has in the football club. He’s been developing in a natural way like they always do. Everyone knows how important Bukayo is for us so hopefully we can do it.”Arsenal are also believed to be keen to reward Declan Rice with an improved deal in recognition of his increasing influence. The England midfielder signed a five-year contract with an option to extend by 12 months when he joined from West Ham in 2023 for £105m.Any Arsenal move for Marc Guéhi is understood to be more likely in the summer when his contract at Crystal Palace is due to expire. Manchester City have expressed an interest in signing the defender this month but the FA Cup winners want about £40m. Arsenal have joined Liverpool, Bayern Munich and Real Madrid among Guéhi’s suitors hoping to snap him up on a free.Piero Hincapié will have a scan on a suspected hamstring injury after being taken off against Liverpool.Explore more on these topicsArsenalBukayo SakanewsShareReuse this content"

Maresca’s position became untenable aftera power battle with the Chelsea hierarchywent beyond the point of no return.Liam Rosenior’s Chelsea appointment must be a tipping point not just a landmark moment | Samuel OkaforRead moreRosenior, who has signed a six-and-a-half-year deal, is aware of the need to manage upwards. The 41-year-old has joined from Strasbourg, Chelsea’s partner club, meaning he already has a good understanding of the requirements of his new role. Yet while Chelsea have a team of five sporting directors, give huge importance to the medical department’s advice on load management anddo not want a manager calling all the shots, Rosenior still believes his view on key decisions will carry significant weight.“I don’t think it’s possible to ever be in this job and not be your own man,” he said. “People will see through you straight away. I will make the decisions at this football club. That’s why I’ve been brought in. I understand. I know what’s being said in the press.“But there’s no way you can be successful as a manager if you don’t make the decisions for yourself. The great thing for me is I’ve experienced working in this setup. The guys have been nothing but supportive for me at Strasbourg. We’ve had huge success at that club. I intend to work exactly the same way here.”Rosenior, who watched from the stands asChelsea lost 2-1 to Fulham on Wednesday, was questioned on the difference between a manager and a head coach. He was asked about improving his new side’s disciplinary record and whether he can manage expectations and relationships. “I wouldn’t be sat here if I didn’t think I could deal with those things,” he said. “Being a head coach, you talk about systems and tactics. That’s 10% per cent of the job. The job is to create spirit, energy, a culture. It doesn’t matter if you’re called a head coach, manager or anything else. The job is the same.”View image in fullscreenLiam Rosenior starts to put some of his ideas into practice at Chelsea training. He believes systems and tactics are 10% of his job.Photograph: Darren Walsh/Chelsea FC/Getty ImagesChelsea supporters have not warmed to managers hired since the club’s takeover by Todd Boehly and Clearlake Capital. They were used to star names such as José Mourinho, Carlo Ancelotti and Thomas Tuchel during the Roman Abramovich era but Rosenior, who was at Derby and Hull before Strasbourg, hopes the crowd will not be underwhelmed by his appointment.“Everybody starts somewhere,” he said. “You’re not a name until you become a name. Judge what you see. Judge what you see on the pitch. Give myself, my staff and my players the chance to prove we are worthy. Judge us and be fair. If the performances aren’t good enough, I’ll be the first one to say. I’m the most accountable person to our performances. But give us the chance.”Did Rosenior ever imagine he would manage Chelsea? “You don’t limit your ambitions,” he said. “I’m not arrogant. I’m good at what I do.”Rosenior, who has longstanding relationships with three of Chelsea’s sporting directors, arrives at a febrile time. A protest against the ownership will be held outside Stamford Bridge before next weekend’s game against Brentford. Maresca’s departure has increased opposition to the project and there were constant mutinous chants against Behdad Eghbali, Clearlake’s co-founder and Chelsea’s co-controlling owner, during the defeat by Fulham. “The same thing happened in Strasbourg and 95% of the fans saw what my team stood for in the end,” Rosenior said.One of the frustrations for fans is Chelsea’s focus on young players. It has been argued that they need more experience in the squad. “There’s nothing better than being on a journey with a group,” Rosenior said. “I was a Manchester United fan and I am now massively a Chelsea fan. I remember Sir Alex Ferguson was brave enough to put six, seven players between the ages of 19 and 21 in his team, in a title-winning team, because he believed in them.”It was put to Rosenior that United’s youngsters could lean on experienced professionals such as Peter Schmeichel, Steve Bruce, Gary Pallister, Denis Irwin, Roy Keane and Eric Cantona when they won the Double in the 1995-96 season. “You’ll see in time what will happen here and the discussions we’ve had,” Rosenior said. “The project is about winning. I’m going to be working very hard on that and I’m going to quote that question that you gave me.”Meanwhile, Chelsea have been charged by the Football Association after a bottle was thrown towards Aston Villa’s bench at the end of their match last month. The incident occurred afterVilla fought back to win 2-1 at Stamford Bridgeand led to the Midlands club complaining to Chelsea, who vowed to investigate.It was unclear at the time if the bottle was thrown by someone from the stands or the home bench, but an FA statement said: “It is alleged that the club failed to ensure its players and/or other relevant personnel positioned around the technical area after the final whistle did not behave in an improper and/or provocative and/or abusive way.”Explore more on these topicsChelseanewsShareReuse this content"

West Ham remain reluctant to make theirsecond sacking of the ­seasonbut are increasingly unimpressed with the Portuguese’s tactics and did not like his demeanour after their latest defeat.West Ham fan turnout against Nottingham Forest almost half official attendanceRead moreFigures within the club were dismayed to see Nuno smiling at full time and embracing some of his old players. Nuno was pictured with players including Morato and Morgan Gibbs-White, whose late winner left West Ham seven points behind 17th-placed Forest. Nuno had looked aghast when Forest, who won 2-1 after trailing at half-time, were awarded their penalty after the video assistant referee called for a review.Although it is accepted that Nuno was liked by many of Forest’s players and was facing them for the first time since his messy exit from the City Ground, it was felt he should have waited until he was away from the cameras before reuniting with members of his old team. West Ham had just suffered an agonising late defeat and are on course to lose their fight to stay in the Premier League. In that context sources at the club thought Nuno, who has two wins from 16 games since replacing Graham Potter in September, was naive to be seen smiling before heading down the tunnel.It comes with staff and players at West Ham feeling increasingly demoralised. It has been reported thatNuno is losing the support of his squadbecause of concerns over his tactics and man-management. The wider mood at the training ground is understood to be low.Some sources at West Ham believe Nuno should have been fired after last weekend’s3-0 defeat at Wolves. However, the final decision rests with David Sullivan, the largest shareholder, who is believed to be unhappy with Nuno but firing him would leave West Ham having to pay off a third manager in the space of 12 months. Potter did not last long after replacing Julen Lopetegui a year ago.West Ham have tried to back Nuno, bolstering his attack by spending up to £47m on Pablo Felipe from Gil Vicente and Taty Castellanos from Lazio. A fee of €21m (£18.2m) plus €3m in add-ons for the 22-year-old Pablo has caused surprise with some inside and outside the club, though. He joined Gil Vicente for €250,000 in July 2024. Nuno pushed for Pablo and Castellanos. Callum Wilson, the 33-year-old striker, isin talks to leave West Hamby mutual consent.West Ham host QPR in the third round of the FA Cup on Sunday, then visit Tottenham in the league the ­following Saturday.

With the ball trapped between Dorgu’s legs, Walker stamped on the back of the Dane’s left thigh before offering a handshake, which was accepted. As the referee and video assistant referee missed it, Walker escaped censure.When Fletcher was asked if Dorgu should have made more of it to ensure the officials did take notice, the Scot cited Walker going to ground in the first half when challenged by Lisandro Martínez in Burnley’s area before the United defender stood back up and scored. However, the goal was ruled out by VAR.“So like Kyle Walker did when Licha didn’t touch him? Yeah,” Fletcher said. “That’s sort of the territory we’re getting into, but Patrick’s such an honest guy, he’s never going to do that.“It didn’t look great from Kyle Walker’s point of view, but I like Kyle and I know him as a person, so I hope the intent was to get the ball. For me personally, I think VAR should have looked at it. They looked at the goal disallowed, which was ridiculous, so they should have been looking at that for me. And if they don’t, you’re just going to encourage players making massive dramas out of things and being theatrical, which is what we don’t want in the game.“I don’t want that from my players. I’d strive [for] my players not to do it. But these two situations probably were massive influences on the game the other night, so it shows you how influential it can be.”Fletcher will be in charge again for Sunday’s visit of Brighton in the FA Cup. With Ole Gunnar Solskjær and Michael Carrick the favourites to be employed in the caretaker role until the end of the season, the 41-year-old was asked if there had been any discussions about his role. “There have been no thoughts or conversation about my future,” said Fletcher. “I lead the team, guide the team, there’s been no conversations outside of those two people.”Jamie Jackson2.Romero handed additional one-match banThe Tottenham captain, Cristian Romero, has been handed a one-match suspension for his reaction to being sent off during last month’s2-1 Premier League loss to Liverpool, the FA said on Friday. The centre-back, who received a second yellow card for kicking out at Ibrahima Konaté in added time, did not immediately leave the field after being shown a red card and argued with the referee, leading to a charge for acting in an “improper” manner.“The defender subsequently admitted the charge, and an independent regulatory commission has now imposed a one-match suspension and £50,000 fine after a hearing,” the FA posted on X.Romero, who served his automatic one-match suspension in the1-0 win at Crystal Palace on 28 December, now faces an additional game on the sidelines. With Spurs 14th in the table and without a win in their past three games,Romero apologised tothe club’s fans in a social media post, suggesting it should not be the players having to front up to the supporters.The Tottenham manager, Thomas Frank, said on Thursday that Romero was a “young leader” who made a mistake, and that he and the club’s sporting director, Johan Lange, had met with him to discuss the post.ReutersView image in fullscreenCristian Romero shares his displeasure with referee John Brooks during the defeat by Liverpool.Photograph: Justin Tallis/AFP/Getty Images3.Howe hoping Schär’s injury won’t end seasonEddie Howe expects Fabian Schär to be sidelined for an extended period but is hopeful that the Newcastle defender will recover from an ankle ligament injury in time to play again this season. Schär was taken to hospital following a collision with Dominic Calvert-Lewin duringWednesday’s 4-3 home win against Leedsbut Newcastle’s manager is optimistic that the damage is not quite as bad as initially feared.“Maybe it’s not as bad as it first looked, there’s no fracture,” said Howe, whose side host his former club, Bournemouth, in the FA Cup third round on Saturday. “But Fabian will be seeing a specialist in the next few days to get some more definitive answers. At the moment we’re confident Fabian will be back before the end of season but let’s see. We still have to get a definitive assessment on the scale of the injury.”With Dan Burn still recovering from a punctured lung and broken ribs, Howe has limited defensive options but will resist the temptation to rush into the transfer market. “It’s not ideal but at the moment we’re taking a watching brief,” said Newcastle’s manager. “We’ll see how we go in the next few games and that will have a bearing on what we do.”One option is to recall the full-back Matt Targett from his loan at Middlesbrough but it is believed the player would be unhappy to leave the Riverside where he is playing a key role in Boro’s Championship promotion push. “We’re looking at all options,” said Howe. “But with Matt there is not just our wants and needs, there is his as well and we have to balance both.”The Newcastle manger also revealed that Jamaal Lascelles, the club captain and once the mainstay of his defence, is unable to train and could leave St James’ Park this month. “Jamaal is not training with us currently,” said Howe. “He hasn’t felt well enough physically to train. I don’t think he’s injured particularly but his body isn’t ready. There is a possibility he could leave but Jamaal has been an excellent leader for us over the years behind the scenes.”Louise Taylor4.Iraola eager to fill Semenyo gapAndoni Iraola has said Bournemouth will act in the January window to replace Antoine Semenyo after his£62.5m move to Manchester City on Friday. The 26-year-old Ghana winger has scored 10 goals in 21 appearances this season, signing off withWednesday night’s winner against Tottenham, and leaves a void in Iraola’s side. The issue is compounded by an injury to Justin Kluivert.“Yes, of course we have to sign a winger,” Iraola said when asked if the club would be active in January. “Yes. Antoine has played almost every minute with us. So there is a hole there that we have to fill. Probably not with the same skills as Antoine. It can be a different type of player we can sign in the market. It’s a market that is not easy because there are not a lot of players available. No one wants to lose a good player in January, but I think we have to look at all the options we have available and try to get it right.”Iraola said the injuries will mean a number of younger players will be in the matchday squad for Saturday’s FA Cup third-round tie away to fellow Premier League side Newcastle. “Some of the younger players will come with us, definitely, because we cannot fill the squad right now,” the manager said. “I think we have, depending on how we train …14 or 15 [outfield players] and it’s a matter of how you balance it in terms of how they recover from the other day, also thinking who can finish the game.”PA Media5.Martínez to miss Villa’s Spurs tieAston Villa will be without goalkeeper Emiliano Martínez for the FA Cup trip to Tottenham. The Argentina World Cup winner came off at half-time ofWednesday’s goalless draw at Crystal Palacewith a calf injury, although he wanted to play on. He will not recover in time for the trip to north London, with Marco Bizot set to deputise.“He is really being in the commitment we need of him,” Villa’s manager, Unai Emery, said. “He played on Wednesday knowing he has a small injury and he did the effort to play. For him it is easier to decide not to play, but he played. The first half he was not feeling good.“It was his choice to play the second half, but because he is in the risk to get the worse injury, we decided with the doctor to stop him. He is helping the team and now I am happy with him. I am seeing him like I want. After last summer, it was difficult for everybody and him as well. Now I can face him and see his eyes and trust him.”Tyrone Mings is in contention but Amadou Onana and Ross Barkley are injured, while Evann Guessand is at the Africa Cup of Nations.PA MediaView image in fullscreenEmiliano Martínez will miss Villa’s Cup game against Spurs.Photograph: Allstar Picture Library Ltd/Neal Simpson/Apl/Sportsphoto6.Le Bris will not rest players against EvertonRégis Le Bris plans to pick a strong Sunderland side in the FA Cup for Saturday’s tie against Everton. The Black Cats go into their third-round tie on Merseyside on the back of a3-0 league defeat by Brentford on Wednesdaynight, ending their five-game unbeaten run which has seen the team play some games without six players on Africa Cup of Nations duty.Asked about potential changes for the Everton match, Le Bris said: “New game, new energy. I think we want to go strong because we respect this competition and at the same time we’ll have to manage the load of a few players. We won’t take unnecessary risks, but we’ll select the best team as possible. So we’ll see.“It will be a tough challenge once again. It’s important to respect the competition and knowing the fatigue we have in the squad because the festive period was busy, really demanding.”Sunderland will assess striker Wilson Isidor, who trained with the team on Friday morning having missed the last two games through injury.PA MediaExplore more on these topicsFootballThe talknewsShareReuse this content"

Bridget Bolland, operations manager and one of the mini-army of staff who keep the part-time sixth-tier side ticking, relays how, normally, visiting teams have their post-match meal on a bench beside the skittles alley, sausage and chips usually the offering. The thought of Bruno Fernandes or Erling Haaland tucking in here is yet to fully evaporate.But the draw meant Weston, the promotion-chasing National League South side who have reached this stage of the Cup for the first time, have been preparing for a different challenge: a tie at fourth-tier Grimsby Town, whobeat Manchester United in the Carabao Cupin August. “As a United fan, I hated them that night,” says Weston’s manager, Scott Rogers. “I was going mad at the TV. But I’m hoping we can do something similar. There’s always an upset in the Cup: why can’t it be us?”FA Cup third round: 10 things to look out for this weekendRead moreIt is 10am and the players, who train twice a week, usually on Tuesdays and Thursdays, file into a room for a short analysis meeting. Gary Warren, the assistant manager and head of academy, runs through a few clips. “The only rest you get is at half-time, full time and when the final whistle goes,” he says. Rogers has the final word: “Let’s make sure we’re proactive. To get to the first round is a big achievement for a non-league side … to get to the third is almost unheard of.”Weston, the joint lowest-ranked team left in the competition with National League North side Macclesfield, overcame division rivals Chelmsford City in the previous round. That day Louis Britton, a Bristol-born striker, was Weston’s hero, scoring both goals. After the match the team joined supporters at the Flyer, a pub round the corner from their opponents’ ground.View image in fullscreenFormer Northern Ireland international Michael Smith (centre) in training.Photograph: Jim Wileman/The Guardian“We had a few beers with them and it was brilliant,” says Michael Smith, the 37-year-old full-back who won 19 caps for Northern Ireland. “That’s what this level is all about. You probably wouldn’t get that with league clubs but to give a little bit back to the fans was special. Great day.” How was the journey back to Somerset? “We were well lubricated, put it that way,” Smith says with a smile.Rogers bought a crate of beers from Morrisons for the bus home (on which the forward Will Dawes turned DJ) and called his parents before joining the party. “I just sat on the coach on my own and it was nice to have that moment,” Rogers says. “Everyone was saying: ‘Why aren’t you in here?’ I just needed some peace and quiet because it had been so hectic. I had my notebook for the game, squiggles everywhere, and when we got to the 83rd minute I just wrote: ‘Please, God.’ Great memories. And I’ve been doing a lot of praying lately … come on, give us one more.”Weston’s squad comprises players at both ends of their careers and everyone from builders and teachers to labourers and lecturers, in the case of the captain, Emlyn Lewis, who works at Cardiff Metropolitan University. “Luckily, we had enough time to put annual leave in,” says Lewis of travelling north on Friday. The youngster Charlie Cummins is on loan from Exeter. Adam May and Dom Bernard have played in League One, Scott Wilson in League Two. Smithfaced Chelsea with Peterboroughin the FA Cup third round in 2017. “Chelsea went on to win the Premier League, so it was a good squad: Pedro, Fàbregas, Kanté, John Terry,” he says.View image in fullscreenWeston’s Emlyn Lewis works at Cardiff Metropolitan University and is taking annual leave in order to play at Grimsby.Photograph: Jim Wileman/The GuardianLewis’s doctoral thesisled him to record the lives of eight managers. “How do coaches manage the everyday pressures of the job?” Lewis says. “Have you been home? Have you seen your family? The research showed that there are no boundaries, it is 24/7. There were times when managers got sacked. I am very grateful they allowed me to be part of their lives, in a way, for 12 months.”Jacob Cane, the club’s longest-serving player, who came through the ranks at Exeter, has made more than 400 appearances across 11 years. In his first season at Weston, he and Ollie Watkins, who joined on loan from Exeter with Matt Jay, now of Torquay, shared lifts from Devon. Cane remembers training on a “mud bath” that winter but these days there is a slick artificial surface. The midfielder remains close friends with Watkins – whose signed Aston Villa and Weston shirts adorn the walls of the boardroom – and attended the Euro 2024 final in Berlin to supporthis former teammate. “We still talk about his time here,” Cane says.Around town there is pride at Weston’s progress. “My uncle Martyn, who I played under at Tiverton Town, managed for 36 years and never got past the first round,” says Rogers, who in 1999 scored the winning goal at Wembley to win the FA Vase. “When we got through to the second round this season, he said: ‘Bloody hell, unbelievable, I’ve been trying to do that all my life.’ To get through again … everyone kept asking: ‘Who do you want?’ I always tell my kids: ‘Don’t say want, because it’s greedy’ – but I would’ve liked Bristol City. That would’ve been my dream because I was an apprentice there and got released.”View image in fullscreenAn Aston Villa shirt signed by Ollie Watkins hangs in the clubhouse.

Paul, who turns 80 next year, will be one of 10 of the Bliss family in attendance at Grimsby, where Weston have a 1,200 allocation. This season Weston renamed a stand at their stadium in honour of their president, Dennis Usher, whose association with the club began in 1979 and whose father was involved in the 50s. Plans to build a 750-seat stand and new facilities were recently approved.Victory at Chelmsford will live long in the memory for all involved but they are targeting another historic triumph. The Cup run has generated about £150,000 for a club with a mid-table budget for their division. “I can normally tell the manager how much budget they have left but this year it has been confusing – for a good reason,” says Oli Bliss, who budgeted for two wins across theFA Cupand FA Trophy. Saturday’s trip to Blundell Park represents Weston’s seventh match on a memorable adventure, one that began at Taunton Town in September and they hope it does not prove the last. “If we go through, it will be a pretty momentous day,” says Bliss.Explore more on these topicsWeston-super-MareFA CupfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The Austrian declared he was“not David Copperfield”in his first press conference and usually has a saying for whatever situation Palace are in, such as declaring theymust not be “one-hit wonders”after winning the FA Cup.It was therefore no surprise to find Glasner had come prepared when he played a straight bat to questions about his future this week after Ruben Amorim’s sacking by Manchester United. “I’m not allowed to bet,” he said when asked to comment on the fact he is the bookmakers’ favourite to take over at Old Trafford in the summer.New outfits and snow disruption: inside Macclesfield before jackpot FA Cup tieRead moreMuch more revealing given the circumstances behind Amorim’s departure was Glasner’s answer to a question about whether there is any real difference between being a manager or head coach. “Every successful company is a discussion,” he said. “If you have smart people there, and every club I believe has smart people – we definitely have here – and then you have your own opinion, and you don’t need to always say: ‘Yes, yes, yes.’“If it’s just yes men you’re not successful. It would be, from my perspective, stupid if I didn’t use the experience and the knowledge of the players, if I didn’t use the experience and knowledge of a sporting director, of a chairman, of a scouting director, of a doctor, of a fitness coach.”It is unlikely that was intended as a message to United’s hierarchy, although it will surely have gone down well with Jason Wilcox and co. Yet they are not the only ones who could have Glasner in their sights this summer, when his contract is due to expire, with Tottenham and Bayern Munich among those believed to be keeping tabs.Siegmund Gruber, the chief executive of the Austrian club Lask, where Glasner spent four years before joining Eintracht Frankfurt,said in Maythat several “big clubs” had been asking how to contact the coach even before Palace’svictory over Manchester Cityat Wembley sealed their first major trophy.“I’ve said: ‘OK, but prepare yourself for the meeting. Because Oliver will have questions – not some, I will say a lot!’” Gruber said. “He is much smarter than a coach who comes in and just does a presentation on how his team will play. And I’m quite sure that won’t change with the bigger clubs.”View image in fullscreenOliver Glasner delivered Crystal Palace’s first major trophy with victory in last season’s FA Cup final.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianGlasner said this week heexpected to make a decisionabout whether to extend his stay at Palace after more talks in the coming weeks with the chair, Steve Parish, but there is a growing feeling this could be his last season there. Bayern were interested in 2024 before they decided to appoint Vincent Kompany and Palace first tried to persuade Glasner to sign a new deal last March after RB Leipzig showed interest.They tried again in the summer but Glasner was reluctant to commit beyond the end of this season, when Palace hope to add the Conference League trophy to a cabinet that also containsthe Community Shield. His admission this week that his future will not depend on what happens in the transfer window is a departure fromcriticism of Palace’s failureto provide him with enough reinforcements for their debut campaign in Europe and could be a hint at what comes next.“I would say everyone in Austria is expecting him to leave and they are excited to see him at a really big club,” says Andreas Heidenreich, the sports editor of the Austrian newspaper Kurier. “Glasner has been successful wherever he has gone but he didn’t coach an absolutely top club like Bayern or Manchester United. That’s the only thing missing in his coaching career and that’s what the Austrians want to see: if he can do it in a big club as well.”Glasner cut his teeth as a coach at Red Bull Salzburg under Ralf Rangnick, who is credited with convincing him to become a manager. Glasner sounded out Rangnick – who has been in charge of Austria’s men’s team since he left United in 2022 after winning 11 of his 29 matches – before joining Palace and will no doubt seek more advice should Old Trafford come calling. The unknown is whether his counter-pressing approach, so successful at Eintracht and Palace, could work at a club where Glasner’s team would be expected to have more possession. Palace have an average of 43.1% possession this season compared with Manchester United’s 54%.“His approach was always based on being without the ball – a lot of pressing,” says Heidenreich. “So it would be a big change from Amorim to Oliver Glasner; it’s definitely another style of football. That’s the point. Glasner suits a smaller club perfectly. That is what we all know because we have seen it in several clubs where he has been coach. So that is the only question not to be answered so far. Can Glasner coach a club where they have around 60% ball possession in every match?”Explore more on these topicsCrystal PalacefeaturesShareReuse this content"

While the former United midfielder and Solskjær are the favourites, the current caretaker manager, Darren Fletcher, cannot be completely ruled out. The Scot oversaw United’s 2-2 draw at Burnley on Wednesday and will again take charge of Sunday’s FA Cup tie against Brighton at Old Trafford.Berrada and Wilcox were at Turf Moor and it is understood Fletcher impressed with the way he instructed the team at half-time when United were trailing 1-0. United subsequently went 2-1 ahead in the second period through two impressive Benjamin Sesko goals before a late Jaidon Anthony equaliser.Solskjær was previously United interim manager from December 2018 to March 2019, an impressive tenure earning him the job on a permanent basis. In his two full seasons Solskjær led United to third and second place and the 2021 Europa League final, which was lost to Villarreal on penalties.Carrick was part of his coaching staff and led United in three games when Solskjær was sacked in late November 2021. He won two of those games and drew the other.If Solskjær, who is considered the marginal favourite for the interim position, is appointed Carrick is open to working with him again, as his No 2. If Carrick is given the job whether he would offer Solskjær a role under him is unclear.On Friday Fletcher, United’s Under-18s coach, was asked about his long-term future at the club.“I speak to Omar and Jason, that’s how the processes work,” he said. “For me, I’ve been focusing on the job at hand, preparing the team for these two games. There’s been no thoughts or conversations about my future.“ Honestly, the people in charge, Jason and Omar, have given me full responsibility to take control of these two games, make my own decisions, lead the team, guide the team, prepare the team, and that’s what I’ve been doing.“There’s been no conversations with anybody outside of those two people in higher-up positions in the club.”Explore more on these topicsManchester UnitedOle Gunnar SolskjaernewsShareReuse this content"

He was eliminated in the first round by Zhou Yuelong.He has missed several tournaments this season, including the Wuhan Open and the British Open, citing medical reasons or the need to prioritise his mental health.World Snooker said in a statement: “Ronnie O’Sullivan has withdrawn from the Johnstone’s Paint Masters for medical reasons.“O’Sullivan was due to face Neil Robertson in the opening round on Wednesday January 14th at 7pm. He has been replaced in the draw by Chris Wakelin who was 17th seed at the cut-off point. The tournament at Alexandra Palace in London runs from January 11-18.”The exact nature of the medical condition has not been disclosed.Explore more on these topicsRonnie O'SullivanSnookernewsShareReuse this content"

Lanesborough and French Ship are two of the more obvious candidates, but the eye-catcher at the early prices is Paul Nicholls’Fasol(3.17) at around 12-1.The seven-year-old has won his last two starts with Olive Nicholls, the trainer’s daughter, in the saddle for both victories, and had more than enough in hand at Musselburgh last time to suggest a hat-trick is a distinct possibility.Quick GuideSaturday's tipsShowLingfield11.40 Dandy Khan 12.10 Call Glory 12.40 Secret Road 1.10 Siam Ruby 1.47 Dream Pirate 2.20 Gogo Yubari 3.00 The Thames Boatman 3.38 Charlie’s ChoiceKempton12.20 Baron Noir 12.55 Leader In The Park 1.30 Precious Man 2.05 The Doyen Chief 2.40 Kalif Du Berlais 3.17 Fasol (nap) 3.53 QuavisteWarwick12.45 Shotgun Rider 1.15 A Great Excuse 1.52 Moon Rocket 2.25 Soldier’s Leap 2.55 Mr Vango (nb) 3.32 Lud D’Or 4.02 Diamond StreetNewcastle3.10 Alpine Sierra 3.47 Tasever 4.20 Relevant Range 4.50 Pink Socks 5.20 Inspired 5.50 Goldmoyne 6.20 Sound And Vision 6.50 Spartan Fighter 7.20 Superior Council.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Warwick 1.15Jamie Brace’s 5lb claim onA Great Excusecould tip the balance in a tight novice handicap chase.Kempton 1.30Dan Skelton’sPrecious Manmade a fine start for his new stable in a traditionally strong juvenile hurdle at Cheltenham in November.Fairyhouse 1.40Henry de Bromhead’s nine-year-oldInthepockethas just five races to his name over fences and looked sure to improve for the run on his belated handicap debut at Navan in December.Warwick 1.52A fascinating Grade Two novice chase, withMoon Rocketpossibly the pick of the prices if back to the form of his chase debut at Doncaster in November.Kempton 2.05With significant doubts over Soul Icon’s stamina and Welcome To Cartries’ consistency,The Doyen Chieflooks like the safest option at around 100-30 as he drops back to three miles having been stretched by an extra two furlongs last time.Warwick 2.25Soldier’s Leapwon with any amount in hand at Uttoxeter in November but still posted a useful time and has scope for another win off an 11lb higher mark.Kempton 2.40Kalif Du Berlais,a Grade One-winning novice chaser,was the beaten favourite in the Haldon Gold Cup but the first two home there were both winners next time and the six-year-old should improve for the outing.Warwick 2.55Sara Bradstock’s stable star,Mr Vango,showed further improvement under a big weight at Aintree in December and will be tough to pass if he gets into a rhythm back over a marathon trip.Warwick 3.32Lud D’Orremains progressive and will appreciate the step up to three miles.Explore more on these topicsHorse racingHorse racing tipsnewsShareReuse this content"

Those who pay have to provide personal details, meaning they could be identified if the function was misused.Grok AI: is it legal to produce or post undressed images of people without their consent?Read moreAsked about the change, a Downing Street spokesperson said it was unacceptable. “The move simply turns an AI feature that allows the creation of unlawful images into a premium service,” they said.“It’s not a solution. In fact, it’s insulting to victims of misogyny and sexual violence. What it does prove is that X can move swiftly when it wants to do so. You heard the prime minister yesterday. He was abundantly clear that X needs to act, and needs to act now. It is time for X to grip this issue.“If another media company had billboards in town centres showing unlawful images, it would act immediately to take them down or face public backlash.”Asked if No 10 was going to take any further action, such as leaving X, the spokesperson said “all options are on the table”, and that it would support any action taken by Ofcom, the UK’s media regulator.Speaking earlier on Friday, Anna Turley, the Labour party chair and a minister without portfolio in the Cabinet Office,saidthere was no move as yet for the government to leave X, but individual ministers were considering doing so.She told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “It’s really, really important that we tackle this. Those conversations are ongoing across government. I think all of us in politics are evaluating our use of social media and how we do that, and I know that conversation is happening.”Asked if she would leave the site, Turley said: “I’ve thought about that a lot over the past few months.” Asked whether theLabourparty would do so, she said: “Those conversations are taking place because it’s really important that we make sure that we’re in a safe space.”The victim’s commissioner, Claire Waxman, said X was no longer a “safe space” for victims and her office was considering scaling back its presence on the site and focusing its communications on Instagram.“It makes the battle against violence against women and girls much harder when platforms such as X are enabling abuse on such an easy and regular basis,” Waxman said, adding that the platform was having a negative impact on its users’ mental health because of the proliferation of violence, abuse and race hate.“Why is that material not being taken down and those users being stopped?” she asked. “It is not safeguarding its users.” Waxman said she was concerned about Ofcom’s ability to police platforms such as X effectively. “Does Ofcom have the teeth to be able to really deal with these sorts of issues? That is a concern for me.”There has been an exodus of women’s sector organisations from X. The domestic abuse charity Refuge left the site, as has Women’s Aid Ireland and Victim Support. Victim Support left in April, saying it was “no longer the right place for us to communicate with our audiences”. Women’s Aid Ireland said the decision was taken because of “increased levels of unchecked hate, misogyny, racism and anti-LGBTI+ content on the platform”.Emma Pickering, the head of technology at Refuge, said the decision by X to restrict access to the image tool for Grok to paying subscribers amounted to “the monetisation of abuse”.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

Don’t expect the US to take actionMoira DoneganElon Musk’s reckless and degrading AI could be built differently. But Americans will have to speak upFri 9 Jan 2026 14.15 ESTFirst published on Fri 9 Jan 2026 08.00 ESTShareOver the past year,Elon Muskhas made a series of protocol changes to Grok, the proprietary AI chatbot of his company xAI, which runs prominently on his social media site X, formerly Twitter. Many of these changes have been geared to make the bot more amenable to producing pornography. In August, Grok launched an image generator, branded as Grok Imagine, which featured a service geared toward creating nude, suggestive or sexually explicit content, including computer-generated pornographic images of real women. The feature, which was quickly used to create naked images of celebrities such as Taylor Swift, also allowed users to create brief videos, complete with animations and sounds.Musk also rolled out AI girlfriends on the platform: animated personas – including female characters with exaggerated breasts and hips – that interacted in sexually explicit ways with users. One of the characters, “Ani”, was an anime-style cartoon blonde with a series of skimpy outfits; the bot blew kisses and addressed users as “my love” while directing the chats toward sexual content.Later last fall, an internal update to Grokpushed the bot towards darker and more extreme content. Though the sexualization of children was technically disallowed in the bot’s internal prompts, the bot’s instructions from xAI state that “‘teenage’ or ‘girl’ does not necessarily imply underage”. The instructions also emphasize that the bot should not observe any restrictions on the darkness or violence of sexual content,the Atlantic reported. Taken together, these updates allow the bot to create realistic images of real, living “teenagers” or “girls” – along with adult women or anybody else – for the sake of users’ sexual gratification.Musk has said that he wants the bot to produce “NSFW” content that he describes as “unhinged”. Users have obliged. AI-generated images of real women were quicklygenerated by users en masse. Men and others were able to use the product to harass women they knew – to take revenge on old girlfriends, humiliate co-workers, classmates, family members and acquaintances, and to express domination or contempt for strangers, internet personalities, celebrities and ordinary users. “@Grok put her in a bikini” or “@Grok take her clothes off” or “@Grok spread her legs” becameregular responsesto any images women post of themselves – or which are posted by others – on the platform. Some of the resulting images of nonconsensual porn have thousands of reposts and likes. The risk and reality of being subject to nonconsensual, AI-generated porn – and to having those images go viral on the large social-media platform where the generator was embedded – quickly became a new tax on women’s presence online and in the public sphere, a tax that women must pay with their dignity. Musk and his companies’ interventions have had a ripple effect on women’s civil rights, limiting their access to the public sphere by making that public sphere hostile and intimately degrading to women at a massive scale.X removed a number of these images, but many remained online, and it seems few users have been suspended for making them. As of this week,the bot had notbeen effectively changed toprevent this kind of abuse. As if in a parody of the allergy felt by the tech industry – and by Musk in particular – to all kinds of responsibility or moral seriousness, these sexualized and abuse-facilitating features on X’s AI products are marked with a cloyingly childish name: “spicy mode”.Now, Musk and xAI’s recklessness and idiotic disregard for the harms of unregulated pornography have been taken to their logical end point: X was awash inAI-generated child sexual abuse material. Female users reported having their childhood pictures turned into nearly naked images by the bot, at the request of users. Some X accounts asked the bot to remove clothing from images of a then12-year-old actor who recently appearedon Stranger Things.An account associated with the Grok bot issued a statement saying: “we’ve identified lapses in safeguards and are urgently fixing them.” On Friday, Grok announced it would turn off the image-generating function for users who are not paying subscribers, butthe Verge foundits tools “remain readily available for any X user”. Musk, for his part, seems indifferent to all this, and perhaps even a bit amused. Hehas said: “Anyone using Grok to make illegal content will suffer the same consequences as if they upload illegal content” – but he has also responded to posts about the ongoing problem of deepfake porn on his site with a series of laughing-face and flame emojis. Reporting from CNN suggests Musk has been highly resistant to what he sees ascensorshipof Grok, and has expressed frustration with restrictions on the bot in recent weeks, before the eruption of the child sexual abuse material controversy.Regulatory action will not be forthcoming; at least not in the US. The Trump administration, meanwhile, hasintervened to try to stop all state-level efforts to curb AI abuses, signing an executive order in December aimed at mooting state regulations of AI meant to nullify safety and consumer protection efforts. The move comes as the Trump administration adopts an exceedingly generous regulatory posture towards AI as tech companies makemajorcontributions to Trump’scampaign,inauguralandballroomfunds.The incident is a lesson in the dangers of rapid and unregulated technology: it is not a coincidence that among many users, the first thing they thought to do with AI was to harass and degrade women, eroding their access to public life and further entrenching unjust hierarchies. But the power of technology, here, seems secondary to the power of wealth. xAI, its chatbot and image-generating products could be built differently if the priorities of the man who controls them were different. If a man of Musk’s low – intellect, addled brain, insipid humor and gross, self-gratifying misogyny were not the richest person in the world, then the world would not be subject to his indignity. Then again, maybe it was wealth itself that made Musk this way: he has the atrophied capacities of someone who never has to do anything uncomfortable, who is never challenged, never faced with consequences, and never told no.Either way, the only way out of the mess that Musk and Grok have created is to tax Musk enough so that he is no longer so rich that the failures of his character shape the public sphere – that his seeming indifference to the nonconsensual and child sexual abuse material his companies have created no longer results in misogynist, sexualized degradation for Grok’s victims and the public at large. We don’t have to live like this: we can take Musk’s power to hurt and degrade us away from him. We can stop his idiocy from being our problem. The Trump administration will not take on the responsibility of freeing America from the consequences of Musk’s money. Americans must fight for a government that will.Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnistThis article was updated on 9 January 2026 to note that Grok said the image-generating service had been turned off for users who do not subscribe.Explore more on these topicsGrok AIOpinionAI (artificial intelligence)Elon MuskXcommentShareReuse this content"

It will reportedly go on sale around August for about €1,800 (£1,560), although it was the company’s Cyber X concept with four legs and tank-like tracks that had attenders captivated because it might help it finally vanquish the mortal enemy of robot vacuums: climbing stairs.View image in fullscreenRoborock Savos Rover has a pair of legs with wheels to manage stairs.Photograph: RoborockHowever, if actually cleaning the stairs is the goal, Roborock’s first two-wheel-leg robovac might be better.

Samsung debutedits new Family Hub fridge, which includes a screen on the front but its party piece is voice-controlled doors you can open and close hands-free.Less novel but potentially just as useful, GE built a barcode scanner intoits new Profile fridge, which is designed to scan things as you discard them to automatically add them to a shopping list ready for when you need it.

But Jensen Huang, the CEO of Nvidia whose net worth is nearly $159bn,told Bloomberg Televisionthis week that he is “perfectly fine with it”.“We chose to live in Silicon Valley,” Huang said. “And whatever taxes I guess they would like to apply, so be it.”This puts Huang in stark contrast with the Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, Palantir co-founderPeter Thieland Donald Trump’s AI and crypto czar, the venture capitalist David Sacks, all of whom have recently indicated they are leaving California for tax-friendlier states including Florida and Texas.Thetax proposalis being led by the labor union Service Employees International Union-United Healthcare Workers West. If passed, the tax would retroactively apply to residents as of 1 January, and billionaires would have five years to pay it.This means Huang would pay roughly $7bn and Page and Brinwould pay one-time amounts of about $13bn and $12bn, respectively, based on their current net worth of $264bn and $243bn. Thiel would pay $1.3bn, based on his current net worth of $26bn.“What remains undeniable is the underlying unfairness of the current system,” Suzanne Jimenez, the chief of staff for SEIU-UHW, said in an email. “Regular working people pay higher effective tax rates than the wealthiest Americans … Asking those who have benefited most from the economy to contribute more – particularly to stabilize health care systems under direct threat – is a reasonable step.”The proposal is still in the beginning phases. Under California law, it needs to collect 874,641 signatures to qualify for the state ballot in November.California’s governor, Gavin Newsom, has said he opposes the wealth tax and will “fight” it if it proceeds. His spokesperson told the Guardian that Newsom has consistently opposed state-level wealth taxes and the governor believes that “if implemented at a state-only level they drive a race to the bottom”.During theNew York Times DealBook Summitlast month, Newsom said: “You can’t isolate yourself from the 49 others. We’re in a competitive environment.”This puts Newsom at odds with Ro Khanna, the California representative who represents Silicon Valley and who has championed the idea of a wealth tax. Khanna says tech billionaires will probably stay in the state, despite a tax, because California is where the larger industry, innovation and talent pool are located. “A billionaire tax is good for American innovation,” Khanna said, adding that it would spread the wealth to other sectors.When Thiel indicated he was leaving California because of the proposed tax, Khannaposted to X: “I echo what FDR said with sarcasm of economic royalists when they threatened to leave, ‘I will miss them very much.’”Some billionaires fleeThis is not California’s first billionaire exodus. Elon Musk, the world’s richest person, memorably departed for Texas in 2020, which stood tosave him millions in taxes. He has also shiftedseveral of his companies’ headquartersthere. Most recently, in 2024, Musk announced he was moving SpaceX to Texas because of a California law that aimed to protect transgender children in schools. Hecalled the lawa “final straw”.Other tech billionaires have also decamped to Texas, which has no state income tax. Citing a better tax environment, the Palantir co-founder Joe Lonsdalemoved to Austinin 2020, and Larry Ellison transitioned Oracle’s headquarters there in 2020 (he has since said he’s moving the company to Nashville). Michael Dell, the founder of Dell Technologies, has long lived in Texas.Sacks made his announcement on 31 December, posting an image of the Texas flag on X and saying: “God bless Texas.” In a separate post the following day, Sacks wrote: “As a response to socialism, Miami will replace NYC as the finance capital and Austin will replace SF as the tech capital.”Musk, Lonsdale and Dell all responded with hearty welcomes. “No one will fight harder for the independent and free spirit of Texas than people who know [sic] it’s like when that’s taken away,” Muskwrote.Page has not publicly said where he’s moving, but in December companies associated with the Google co-founder filed documents to incorporate in Florida,according to the New York Times. He purchased two homes in Miami for $173.4m in December and January,the Wall Street Journalreported. Thiel, who owns a home in the Hollywood Hills, also seems to have set his sights on Florida. His investment firm, Thiel Capital,announcedon 31 December that it had opened an office in Miami. The firm said Thiel had maintained a personal residence in the city since 2020.Brin also hasn’t publicly announced he’s leaving California, but in mid-December an entity connected to the billionaire either ended or moved more than a dozen of its limited liability companies out of the state, according tothe New York Times. Several of those companies were moved to Nevada.On X, tech investors and other billionaires have blasted the proposed wealth tax. Chamath Palihapitiya, a venture capitalist and former Facebook executive,saidthat without billionaires, California’s “budget deficit will only get bigger”, and Vinod Khosla, another investor,saidthat under the proposed tax, “California will lose its most important taxpayers and net off much worse”.Some have indicated they would work to oust Khanna from Congress. Martin Casado, a partner at the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz,wrotethat Khanna had “devolved into an obnoxious jerk” and that his support of the wealth tax had alienated him from moderates. In response, Garry Tan, the CEO of the startup accelerator Y Combinator,wrote: “Time to primary him.”The SEIU’s Jimenez said states like Massachusetts and Washington, which have other forms of wealth taxes, had seen billions of dollars raised to help the state. At the same time, she said, high-income residents had continued tosee their portfolios grow. Jimenez added that the union was “heartened” by Huang’s recent comments and is hopeful that more billionaires will follow suit.As for Huang, he saidNvidiais in Silicon Valley because that’s where the engineers are and he’s not worried about a billionaire tax.“Not this person,” Huang said. “This person is trying to build the future of AI.”Representatives for Page, Brin, Thiel and Sacks did not return requests for comment.This story was amended on 9 January 2026 to correct that the ballot measure does not need Newsom’s signature to become law.Explore more on these topicsCaliforniaThe super-richTax avoidanceUS politicsNvidiaPeter ThielLarry PagenewsShareReuse this content"

Instead, it’s what is inside that counts.So-called analogue bags, filled with activities such as crosswords, knitting, novels and journals, have become the unexpected accessory of the season.They are being championed by millennials and gen Z as a way to reduce screen time. Similar to aprep bag, the idea is that the bag or basket should contain the essentials needed to remain offline for as long as possible. One user describes it as a “toy box for your attention span”.David Sax, the author ofThe Revenge of Analog, approves of the trend. “The idea that we can all just get into a lotus pose and fall into a state of meditative bliss is wildly unrealistic for the vast majority of us,” he says. “Our phones have everything you could ever ask for, so you need an alternative to hand in order to fill that void.”The term was coined bySierra Campbell, a 31-year-old content creator based in California. “My biggest fear is that I’ll lie on my deathbed and regret how much time I spent on phone,” she says in a TikTok video in which she first suggests the concept.The idea has – somewhat paradoxically – become hugely popular on social media, with users posting videos talking through the contents of their analogue bags and sharing tips on what to fill them with. Some refer to them as their “stop scrolling” bags.There are analogue wicker baskets for evenings on the sofa, bags for long journeys and even some for romantic weekends away. Suggestions include doing a joint wordsearch rather than playing Wordle individually.Campbell’sJanuary analogue bag video– featuring a subscription to the New Yorker magazine, gel pens and a sketchbook – has been viewed more than 200,000 times in five days.The trend forms part of a wider backlash against a culture of doomscrolling and the pressure to always be online. According to Ofcom, the UK telecoms regulator, the average adult in Great Britainchecks their phone every 12 minutes. A 2022 survey by USwitch found that the average daily time among UK adults averaged five hours, in addition to screen-related work tasks.View image in fullscreenThe analogue bag offers a way to reclaim attention and minimise screen use.Photograph: LumiNola/Getty ImagesAnalogue bags sit alongside a resurgence in analogue technologies such asvinyl records,physical magazinesandpoint-and-shoot cameras. Offline, in-person activities – including“cosy hobbies”such as pottery classes, crochet circles and evendinner parties– are also on the rise.Campbell says the catalyst for the analogue bag, which has reduced her screen time from seven hours a day to three, came from reading Charles Duhigg’sThe Power of Habit. In the book, Duhigg outlines three components of a habit: cue, routine and reward.Rather than trying to eliminate a bad habit, he argues that it is more effective to keep the cue and reward while changing the routine. For Campbell, this meant reaching for a bag of screen-free activities instead of her phone.“If you go to your phone for news, put a newspaper in your bag,” Campbell says. “If it’s for entertainment, try a good book. For creative inspiration, sketching tools or knitting. It’s just like physical fitness – whatever activity you’ll actually do is the best one to include.”Rather than a brief digital detox, the analogue bag trend suggests people are attempting to change their relationship with screens for the long term.Pete Etchells, a professor of psychology and science communication at Bath Spa University and author of Unlocked: The Real Science of Screen Time, argues that rather than being addicted to our phones, we have simplyformed habits around their use. He hopes the rise of analogue bags is “a shift in how people understand their relationship with technology”.“We do have agency and control over what we do with our time,” Etchells says. “And if you are not happy with how you use your phone and how you use social media, it’s great that people are starting to think about what the [options] look like – and how we can make access easier to those.”Explore more on these topicsHandbagsAccessoriesSocial mediaSmartphonesMobile phones (Technology)Mobile phones (Money)TelecomsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.The UK weather doesn’t always play ball, though, so for those who don’t want a dire forecast to result in a missed workout, indoor training replicates the exercise (if not the fresh air).The best exercise bikes are not only fantastic for burning a few calories without donning all the outdoor gear, but they can also help you nail training goals if you’re a more serious rider. With many letting you connect your phone or laptop to make the most of online training tools, it’s never been easier or more enjoyable to work out from your home.I tested 12 exercise bikes, including the sort you might find in a commercial gym, along with more dedicated riding simulators and recumbent models for those who find it tricky to sit hunched forward for any length of time. The resulting list features those that I think performed best.While I’ve tried to appeal to a wide range of budgets, it’s difficult to recommend much under the £500 mark because the build quality of these cheaper models is often not worth the investment.At a glanceBest exercise bike overall:Peloton Bike+£1,899 at One PelotonBest budget exercise bike for beginners:Horizon 3.0SC indoor cycle£569.99 at Johnson FitnessBest compact exercise bike:Wattbike Proton£1,575 at WattbikeBest gym-quality exercise bike:Technogym bike£3,620 at TechnogymBest recumbent exercise bike:LifeFitness RS3 LifeCycle£2,095 at John LewisWhy you should trust meWhile I no longer compete in official cycling events, I still consider myself a keen cyclist, often heading out with friends on a gravel bike, even if those rides now end in a warm pub, rather than a timed finish line. But when the weather isn’t playing ball, I’ll get stuck into a home- or gym-based exercise bike session to keep fit and stay in shape for when cycling season comes back around again.Having tested exercise equipment for numerous publications, I’m always one to get stuck in and test a product for as long as possible. With exercise bikes, this meant getting plenty of hands-on experience, no matter how sweaty it made me.How I testedView image in fullscreenWheels on fire: some bikes were tested in dedicated workout spaces.Photograph: Leon Poultney/The GuardianExercise bikes are bulky items that typically require an element of setup or construction. To make testing so many of them viable, I either borrowed a pre-assembled machine for one or two weeks or tested the bikes in a dedicated boutique or workout space.During each test, I used any workout modes that were available, syncing a smartphone or laptop to take advantage of third-party software or online classes, if these were offered. The machines were judged on their build quality, features, ease of setup and storage (some companies offer premium white glove deliveries), as well as the overall adjustability or suitability for numerous members of the household.After slipping into a pair of fetching cycling shoes, I assessed noise levels with a smartphone-based decibel meter, and made more subjective assessments on the general ride feel, comfort and the overall quality of the workout experience.The best exercise bikes in 2026View image in fullscreen‘Unmatched when it comes to live and on-demand classes’: the Peloton Bike+.Photograph: Leon Poultney/The GuardianBest exercise bike overall:Peloton Bike+PelotonBike+from£1,899£1,899 at Peloton£1,899 at John LewisWhat we loveA wide range of engaging workouts that somehow feel funWhat we don’t loveThe monthly subscription cost is hard to swallow, given the initial outlayPhotograph: Leon Poultney/The Guardian£1,899 at Peloton£1,899 at John LewisMany rivals have attempted to imitate Peloton, but few have managed to nail its overall experience. Above all, the brand is unmatched when it comes to live and on-demand classes, offering so many options – from a quick 15-minute spin class to hardcore sportive training, and all led by motivating instructors and accompanied by thumping soundtracks.The Bike+ is the premium one of the brand’s two exercise bikes and has a 23.8in (huge!) high-definition display, which can be rotated for workouts that involve movements off the machine. There’s also an automatic resistance knob that adjusts to match the levels recommended by instructors during classes.It’s expensive, with a £45-a-month “all access” membership fee on top, but for engaging, interactive workouts pitched at a wide range of users, nothing else comes close.Why we love itAlthough the Bike+ isn’t as aesthetically pleasing as some of its rivals, it’s comfortable, easy to adjust and not too imposing in any room. It also has wheels, so it is relatively easy to tip on its end and move around.The touchscreen on the Bike+ is of excellent quality and the sound from its built-in speakers is impressive, but it’s the array of classes that makes Peloton so alluring. Unlike many rivals, which can feel prescribed, mundane and overly technical, Peloton somehow makes a gruelling 45-minute spin session feel enjoyable.The weighted flywheel and belt-drive system are quiet enough to not disturb others in the household, although hardcore road cyclists will probably balk at the Bike+ for its lack of cycling realism and the bouncy, frenetic spin-class nature of many of its workouts.It doesn’t play nicely with third-party cycling apps – such as Zwift, Rouvy and TrainerRoad – either, so, if that’s important to you, look at the Wattbike Proton below instead.It’s a shame that …it doesn’t feel as realistic as some rivals, and there’s a monthly fee to access the classes and featuresDimensions:56 x 137 x 152cm (WLH)Weight:65kgDrivetrain:belt-drive with magnetic, digital resistance adjustmentSimulated grade:N/AConnectivity:Bluetooth 5, ANT+, wifi (2.4GHz and 5GHz)Folding:noNoise level:about 30dBMaximum user weight:135kgBuilt-in entertainment:yes, 23.8in rotating HD touchscreen with Peloton classes, Netflix, Disney+ and morePelotonBike+from£1,899£1,899 at Peloton£1,899 at John LewisWhat we loveA wide range of engaging workouts that somehow feel funWhat we don’t loveThe monthly subscription cost is hard to swallow, given the initial outlayBest budget exercise bike for beginners:Horizon 3.0SC Indoor CycleHorizon3.0SC Indoor Cyclefrom£569.99£569.99 at Johnson Fitness£569.99 at AmazonWhat we loveWell built and capable, despite the low cost of entryWhat we don’t loveLimited built-in workouts, and you’ll need your own screenPhotograph: Leon Poultney/The Guardian£569.99 at Johnson Fitness£569.99 at AmazonAt the time of writing, the Horizon 3.0SC Indoor Cycle cost £569.99, making it one of the cheapest exercise bikes I tested. But it certainly doesn’t feel cheap or any less capable than many of the other exercise bikes I poured sweat upon.The 3.0SC has an ultra-smooth, front-mounted flywheel that uses electronically adjustable magnetic resistance to provide 32 effort levels. All of this is controlled via a funky and futuristic-looking digital dial that responds quickly to inputs – great for jumping out of the saddle during high-intensity efforts.Although this is predominantly designed for use in spin classes, its ergonomically cushioned seat and easy-adjust handlebars make it a comfortable spot to pedal away the hours. Oh, and it’s whisper-quiet too, registering just 32dBduring my testing.It may not be the sort of thing I’d use to train for an upcoming cycling sportive, but it’s a well-priced tool for hitting daily fitness goals.Why we love itThe 3.0SC looks great. It even blasts out eight vibrant colours from its flywheel, depending on the RPM and amount of effort you are putting in, adding a bit of Tron-like sci-fi to any room.And aside from its relatively compact proportions and lightweight build, the bike is also well connected, playing nicely with Zwift, Kinomap and other third-party fitness apps. There are more realistic-feeling bikes out there, but if you swap out the pedals for a dedicated clipless system, it’s a fairly convincing road bike. Space between the cranks, for example, is as narrow as possible, making it ride like a genuine road machine.If you’re looking for on-demand fitness classes, you can find these via Horizon’s freeatZoneworkout app. Pair your phone or tablet with the bike, mount it to the secure plastic holder at the front of the bars, and you’re good to go. For a free service, there’s an impressive amount of content, and it’ll track your progress over time.It’s a shame that…there isn’t an integrated display, meaning you’ll have to bring a tablet or smartphone for any instructor-led workouts.Dimensions: 52 x 107 x 120cm (WLH)Weight:36kgDrivetrain: belt drive with ECB (eddy current) magnetic, electronic resistance (32 levels)Simulated grade:N/AConnectivity:Bluetooth 5 (FTMS compatible for app integration)Folding:no (but features transport wheels)Noise level:about 32dBMaximum user weight:100kgBuilt-in entertainment:no built-in screen; includes tablet holder and syncs with training appsHorizon3.0SC Indoor Cyclefrom£569.99£569.99 at Johnson Fitness£569.99 at AmazonWhat we loveWell built and capable, despite the low cost of entryWhat we don’t loveLimited built-in workouts, and you’ll need your own screenBest compact exercise bike:Wattbike ProtonWattbikeProtonfrom£1,575£1,575 at Wattbike£1,795 at DecathlonWhat we loveA realistic feel and easily customisable between family membersWhat we don’t loveYou’ll need to bring your own video entertainment/inspiration£1,575 at Wattbike£1,795 at DecathlonWattbike is probably best known for its original red, white and blackAir bikemachines, which can be found in gyms and health clubs up and down the country. The company has since ventured into home-workout territory, and the Proton sits somewhere in the middle of its range, offering a lightweight, compact footprint and support for popular third-party training apps, including Zwift and TrainingPeaks.Racy looks and confusing workout programmes may risk putting off more casual users, but the Proton is designed to appeal to all of the family – comfortably adjusting for those between 4ft 6in and 6ft 6in tall. It’s not as quiet as some of its rivals, but the Proton feels realistic to ride and even has an auto-adjusting ergometer mode (ERG), so it can simulate gradients and gear changes without you having to lift a finger.Why we love itWattbike has done an admirable job in retaining a realistic bike feel on such a lightweight and compact machine, with a fully adjustable seat post, saddle and handlebars that make it easy to set up to your requirements. I was able to quickly swap the standard toe-cage pedals for someShimano clipless ones,which improved my performance and gave me greater control over pedal stroke. Most exercise bikes will allow you to swap the pedals, which takes about five minutes if you have the correct spanner or hex key. Adding cleats and pedals allows you to don a dedicated cycling shoe, which provides better power transfer between the legs and pedals compared with basic adjustable toe cages.Wattbike’s background in working with pro athletes is evident from the Wattbike Hub app, which offers real-time feedback on pedal stroke and efficiency, among other nerdy data fields. The app has been tweaked to appeal to the more casual fitness fanatic, but it’s far from friendly to beginners, and you won’t find the same interactivity you would with a Peloton class. It’s more a case of following graphs and on-screen warnings about form than watching live demos from a bubbly personal trainer.However, there are still plenty of workouts aimed at improving overall health rather than targeting highly trained athletes. And, if you like, you can always mount your iPad in the dedicated holder and binge television or complete a virtual workout session of your choice: the Proton’s Bluetooth FTMS technology means it will work with most third-party apps,such as Zwift, TrainerRoad and Rouvy.It’s a shame that …the app isn’t slicker and with more to entice and retain a novice.Dimensions:57 x 102 x 127cm (WLH)Weight:48kgDrivetrain:chain drive with electromagnetic resistanceMaximum power output:1,800WSimulated grade:up to +25% inclineConnectivity:ANT+ FE-C, Bluetooth (FTMS compatible for app integration)Folding:no; includes front transport wheels for ease of movementNoise level:about 40dBMaximum user weight:135kgBuilt-in entertainment: no built-in screen; includes tablet holderWattbikeProtonfrom£1,575£1,575 at Wattbike£1,795 at DecathlonWhat we loveA realistic feel and easily customisable between family membersWhat we don’t loveYou’ll need to bring your own video entertainment/inspirationBest gym-quality exercise bike:Technogym BikeTechnogymBike£3,620£3,620 at TechnogymWhat we loveA superb performer with wide support and built-in appsWhat we don’t loveIt costs a fortune upfront, plus the subscription costPhotograph: Leon Poultney/The Guardian£3,620 at TechnogymTechnogym has been steadily raising the bar when it comes to smart fitness equipment, with a growing line of connected kit that aims to bring the personal trainer experience to your own home.Clearly designed to take on the likes of Peloton, the Technogym Bike is a stylish machine with a 22in high-definition touchscreen that allows access to a raft of Technogym’s live and on-demand content.Its compact, svelte frame looks and feels as if it’s aimed at more serious cyclists than Peloton’s offering, and the ride experience is smoother and slightly more natural than its rival. There’s plenty of adjustability for different-size riders, while the included double-sided pedals allow for use with trainers or SPD cycling shoes (a clipless shoe system).The built-in screen is crisp and easy to navigate, granting access to entertainment apps, including YouTube and Netflix. It rotates to allow for off-bike sessions, too. However, it’s among the most expensive models I tested, and there’s a furthermembership fee, starting at £8.99 a month. Ouch.Why we love itThe riding experience is comfortable without straying too far from a realistic simulation, while the powerful flywheel offers punishing levels of resistance. Technogym has live classes, as with Peloton, but it also appeals to the more hardcore athlete with dedicated training programmes geared towards those with ambitions of tackling the Col de Turini.If you’re seeking the best in terms of design and build quality – and your bank balance permits the luxury – you’ll be happy with this bike. It’s a handsome, well-built machine that straddles the line between a dedicated cycling trainer and a spin bike well.It also works with most third-party training apps and syncs up neatly with Apple Fitness and Apple Watch via a quick-tap NFC panel. For those totally dedicated to Lycra,Technogym offers an even more expensive Ride model, which feels built to compete with Wattbike and Wahoo’s most serious offerings.It’s a shame that …it costs so much, and then Technogym charges yet more for a monthly membership.Dimensions:59 x 121 x 138cm (WLH)Weight:67kgDrivetrain:belt drive with magnetic resistance (20 levels)Simulated grade:not specifiedConnectivity:supports streaming via external device (eg Chromecast, Fire TV Stick); Apple Watch pairing; Technogym Live integration and third-party appsFolding:noNoise level:about 30dBMaximum user weight:160kgBuilt-in entertainment:yes, rotating display with ability to stream apps (TV shows, movies, games, etc) via smartphone, tablet or laptopTechnogymBike£3,620£3,620 at TechnogymWhat we loveA superb performer with wide support and built-in appsWhat we don’t loveIt costs a fortune upfront, plus the subscription costBest recumbent exercise bike:LifeFitness RS3 LifeCycleLifeFitnessRS3 LifeCyclefrom£2,095£2,095 at John Lewis£2,295 at FitshopWhat we loveComfortable and ergonomic for those who need a more relaxed workoutWhat we don’t loveThe console is tricky to use, and there’s no built-in multimedia£2,095 at John Lewis£2,295 at FitshopRecumbent bikes are great for those who experience back pain, struggle with past injuries or simply find it daunting or uncomfortable to be perched atop a traditional exercise bike for any length of time. You can achieve the same, low-impact cardio workout while enjoying a more relaxed seating position that takes the pressure off the lower back, leg joints and neck.LifeFitness is a reputable brand that supplies commercial gym equipment and kit more suited for use at home, with the RS3 sitting between the two. For the money, you get a comfortable, ergonomically fitted seat with backrest, 20 levels of resistance and a step-through design that makes it easy to get on and off. There’s also plenty of adjustment in the seat to get the perfect workout position.Although larger than many more traditional exercise bikes, it can be lifted and moved because of its transport wheels.Why we love itMore seasoned riders will probably find a recumbent bike a little too laidback, since it’s difficult to transfer maximum power through the cranks from the more relaxed seating position. That said, it’s not really designed for smashing PBs – it’s best placed for longer, low-intensity steady-state cardio sessions.It links to Rouvy, Zwift and a bunch of other third-party fitness apps, but the digital offering is otherwise basic, with a handful of built-in and customisable workouts direct from the console. Users can also pair an Apple or Samsung Galaxy Watch for heart-rate tracking and more.Some recumbent bikes can feel decidedly budget, but that’s not the case here. With excellent build quality and a smooth and quiet ride experience, the RS3 is a comfortable place to work up a sweat without the associated aches and pains.It’s a shame that …the Track Connect 2.0 Console is fiddly to use, and there’s no built-in multimedia.Dimensions:68 x 164 x 131cm (WLH)Weight:69.8kgDrivetrain:front-drive magnetic resistance, manual adjustmentSimulated grade:N/AConnectivity:Bluetooth FTMS and NFC for syncing with apps, wireless HR receiverFolding:noNoise level:under 30dBMaximum user weight: 181kgBuilt-in entertainment:no, 7in LCD display with Track Connect Console allowing external tablet/smartphone streaming and app integrationLifeFitnessRS3 LifeCyclefrom£2,095£2,095 at John Lewis£2,295 at FitshopWhat we loveComfortable and ergonomic for those who need a more relaxed workoutWhat we don’t loveThe console is tricky to use, and there’s no built-in multimediaThe best of the restWahoo Kickr ShiftWahooKickr Shiftfrom£2,199.99£2,199.99 at Wahoo£2,499.99 at AmazonWhat we loveCustomisable, and great compatibility with virtual cycling appsWhat we don’t loveThe Wattbike Proton is cheaper and similarly goodPhotograph: Leon Poultney/The Guardian£2,199.99 at Wahoo£2,499.99 at AmazonBest for:cycling enthusiastsIf you’re mad for virtual cycling apps such as Zwift, Rouvy and TrainerRoad, or simply want to replicate that road cycling feel at home, Wahoo’s Kickr Shift is among the best indoor training tools for enthusiasts.The saddle, stem height and reach can all easily be adjusted on the fly, and users can even select their desired crank length. Heck, the bike even simulates several electronically assisted gearing group sets from Shimano and Campagnolo, mimicking the way the cogs feel when shifting under load.It’s a wonderfully quiet, smooth and powerful machine that works perfectly with dedicated cycling training apps. For those who like to reach for the chamois cream at the weekend, this is the perfect indoor companion.It didn’t make the final cut because… the Wattbike Proton feels like a slightly more rounded machine for all the family.Dimensions:78 x 140 x 110cm (WLH);weight:36kg;drivetrain:belt drive with electromagnetic resistance;maximum power output:2,200W;simulated grade:+20% incline, -15% decline;connectivity:ANT+, ANT+ FE-C, Bluetooth, wifi, Direct Connect;folding:no;noise level:under 30dB;maximum user weight:113kg;built-in entertainment:no built-in screen; requires external device for app/displayWahooKickr Shiftfrom£2,199.99£2,199.99 at Wahoo£2,499.99 at AmazonWhat we loveCustomisable, and great compatibility with virtual cycling appsWhat we don’t loveThe Wattbike Proton is cheaper and similarly goodNordicTrack X24 Studio BikeNordicTrackX24 Studio Bikefrom£1,799£1,799 at John Lewis£1,799 at Fitness SuperstoreWhat we loveGreat for spin classes with its huge 24in screenWhat we don’t loveNot as slick as Peloton’s multimedia offering£1,799 at John Lewis£1,799 at Fitness SuperstoreBest for:a studio spin bike feel at homeAnother Peloton Bike+ rival, NordicTrack’s indoor trainer is an excellent spinning machine for a smooth yet powerful ride, with a solid dose of realistic-feeling resistance that will feel tough even for seasoned cyclists. It also comes with a whopping 24in touchscreen for immersive online sessions.Granted, theiFit virtual trainingenvironment doesn’t quite compete with the Hollywood sheen of a Peloton class, but it gets mightily close, and the physical bike feels accomplished and more modern than Peloton’s slightly frumpy-looking machine.Its 20% incline to -10% simulated decline means it also doubles up as an excellent and quite realistic road or mountain biking training tool, with interactive videos that allow you to virtually cycle around some of the most beautiful places on Earth.It didn’t make the final cut because… iFit just isn’t up to Peloton’s offering, and the multimedia setup isn’t quite as slick.Dimensions:55 x 143 x 159cm (WLH);weight:81kg;drivetrain:silent magnetic resistance, 24 digital levels;simulated grade:+20% incline/-10% decline;connectivity:Bluetooth (headphone & HR monitor), wifi (for iFit), USB-C port, app integration via iFit (syncs with Strava, Garmin, Google Fit, Apple Health);folding:no;noise level:about 32dB;maximum user weight:159kg;built-in entertainment:yes, 24in pivoting HD touchscreen with built-in speakers, iFit streaming of workouts, classes, and entertainment appsNordicTrackX24 Studio Bikefrom£1,799£1,799 at John Lewis£1,799 at Fitness SuperstoreWhat we loveGreat for spin classes with its huge 24in screenWhat we don’t loveNot as slick as Peloton’s multimedia offeringSchwinn 510R RecumbentSchwinn510R Recumbentfrom£999£999 at Currys£999.99 at DecathlonWhat we loveRecumbent exercise at a reasonable priceWhat we don’t loveQuestionable build quality and inaccurate heart-rate monitoringPhotograph: Leon Poultney/The Guardian£999 at Currys£999.99 at DecathlonBest for:a recumbent bike on a budgetOffering a cheaper alternative to the LifeFitness recumbent above, Schwinn’s more basic model majors in comfort and adjustability but wraps it up in a slightly lighter and cheaper-feeling frame.The 5.5in segmented LCD screen takes care of the basics, with several built-in workouts to get you going. And there’s always the option to pair a tablet or smartphone and make use of Zwift and other digital training apps.It represents excellent value for money, but don’t expect the same sort of build quality as pricier rivals; the handle-mounted heart-rate monitor was hugely inaccurate during my testing, and there are some cheap plastic covers masking some of the fastening bolts. On that subject, don’t expect a white glove delivery service with something at this price.It didn’t make the final cut because …it’s not quite as robust as rivals, and the built-in heart-rate monitor was way out during tests.Dimensions:69 x 163 x 113cm (WLH);weight:37kg;drivetrain:belt-driven flywheel with 16 levels of manual magnetic resistance;simulated grade:N/A;connectivity:Bluetooth (FTMS compatible for app integration); wireless heart-rate compatibility (strap not included);folding:no;noise level:about 32dB;maximum user weight:136kg;built-in entertainment:no built-in screen for media; includes a 5.5in LCD console (for metrics and programmes) and a media shelf for tabletsSchwinn510R Recumbentfrom£999£999 at Currys£999.99 at DecathlonWhat we loveRecumbent exercise at a reasonable priceWhat we don’t loveQuestionable build quality and inaccurate heart-rate monitoringMatrix U50MatrixU50£3,779£3,779 at Johnson FitnessWhat we loveIncredibly realistic feel and great build qualityWhat we don’t lovePricey, considering its digital offering is a little weakPhotograph: Leon Poultney/The Guardian£3,779 at Johnson FitnessBest for:a gym-quality upright bikeThis model treads the line between a serious studio bike, such as the Peloton Bike+ or NordicTrack X24, and something more relaxed. It has a comfy padded seat, oversized self-balancing pedals and a unique handlebar design that allows for multiple hand positions. Despite the upright positioning, the ride feel is realistic, and there are 30 levels of resistance to contend with.It’s expensive, given that the XUR digital console isn’t as goodas those from Technogym, Peloton and NordicTrack, but this is a solid, reliable and comfortable bit of kit from one of the biggest names in commercial gym equipment.It didn’t make the final cut because …it’s an expensive bike with a less impressive digital offering than cheaper rivals.Dimensions:63 x 122 x 143cm (WLH);weight:60kg;drivetrain:Exact Force induction brake (electronically adjustable resistance);simulated grade:N/A;connectivity:wifi (entertainment apps, software updates), Bluetooth (FTMS compatible for app integration, HR monitor, headphones), HDMI port, USB (media and charging);folding:no, includes transport wheels;noise level:about 28dB;maximum user weight:159kg;built-in entertainment:yes, 22in HD touchscreen with apps including Netflix, YouTube and Spotify, web browser, social media, plus tablet/HDMI mirroringMatrixU50£3,779£3,779 at Johnson FitnessWhat we loveIncredibly realistic feel and great build qualityWhat we don’t lovePricey, considering its digital offering is a little weakWhat you need to knowView image in fullscreenLook for a connected bike with an integrated screen and app compatibility if you want to be entertained while riding.Photograph: Leon Poultney/The GuardianHow much should I spend?Exercise bikes vary wildly in price, with the cheapest models often taking the form of basic upright or spin bikes that focus purely on pedalling, and the most expensive offering large HD touchscreens, automatic resistance adjustments and fully integrated training platforms.Budget models typically start at £250-£400, but often lack the build quality and adjustability needed for long-term use. At the other end of the spectrum, premium connected bikes – such as those from Peloton, Technogym and NordicTrack – can set you back £2,000 or more, and often require monthly subscriptions on top for interactive classes.For most riders, a budget of between £600 and £1,200 is a good place to start for solid build quality, smooth resistance and decent connectivity features without straying into commercial-gym territory.How much room do you need?Even the most compact exercise bikes take up space, with the smallest options measuring about 55 x 120 x 130cm (WLH). While that’s less floor space than atreadmillorcross trainer, you’ll still need clearance around the bike for safe mounting and dismounting, as well as enough ceiling height to remain comfortable when standing on the pedals.Recumbent bikes, which offer a chair-like riding position, often require more floor space, while upright and indoor cycles are more compact. It might be tempting to look at folding exercise bikes, but they can often be flimsy and offer weak pedal resistance.What features should I lookfor?The most important thing is the resistance system: magnetic resistance is smoother, quieter and requires less maintenance than older friction-based systems found on traditional studio spin bikes. Belt-drive systems are also preferable to chain-driven units for their silent, low-maintenance operation.Adjustability is another key factor – a bike with multiple saddle and handlebar positions will ensure better ergonomics and comfort over long sessions, and it will also fit more members of the household.For those who want to stay entertained, connected bikes with integrated screens and app compatibility (Zwift, Peloton, iFit, etc) can make training more engaging. Heart-rate monitoring and Bluetooth/ANT+ connectivity are also useful for tracking progress.Finally, noise levels are worth considering, especially if you live in a flat or plan to exercise when everyone else is sleeping. Modern magnetic systems are whisper-quiet, making them perfect for shared living spaces.Leon Poultney has been a consumer technology and automotive journalist for longer than he cares to divulge.

Here’s our selection of the 15 best titles currently on offer, ranging from family favourites to grittier, more adult challenges.Animal Crossing: New Horizons – Switch 2 editionView image in fullscreenAnimal Crossing: New Horizons.Photograph: NintendoOriginally released in 2020, Nintendo’s lovable life simulator has you cast away on a tropical island, building a home, making friends and inviting other players around for a cup of tea. The new version for Switch 2 (available 15 January) overhauls the visuals and multiplayer connectivity, as well as adding support for the Switch 2 camera.Why we love it:“Your days are spent chasing bugs, chopping wood, arranging furniture and watering flowers, not scrounging for food/water/weapons and fighting people.”Read more.Donkey Kong BananzaView image in fullscreenDonkey Kong Bananza.Photograph: NintendoThe beloved ape teams up with his previous kidnap victim Pauline (no hard feelings, obviously) in this literally smashing subterranean adventure. The rules of the platform genre are cast aside as walls and floors are pulverised by Kong’s massive fists.Why we love it:“I can see Bananza having a second life as an executive stress reliever; a virtual rage room where you heave exploding boulders at cliffs to reduce them to pockmarked swiss cheese.”Read the full review.Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice ChroniclesView image in fullscreenFinal Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles.Photograph: Square EnixOriginally released in 1997,Final FantasyTactics was a battle-focused take on the role-playing adventure series, cutting exploration in favour of tense, contained fight scenes. The Ivalice Chronicles features updated visuals as well as fresh voice acting and difficulty levels, perfectly modernising a PlayStation classic.Why we love it:“[It] offers a model for resistance, and also a commentary on the struggle of opposition in such turbulent times.”Read the full review.Hades IIView image in fullscreenHades II.Photograph: Supergiant GamesThe sequel to 2020’s brilliant mythological action game brings us new lead character Melinoë, a witch who must defeat the god of time and his retinue of sexy, chaotic boss characters. As before, dying returns you to the beginning, but you always reanimate and begin again, lessons learned and experience gained.Why we love it:“[Jen] Zee’s new character illustrations are, if anything, likely to inspire even more aggressively thirsty fan art and fanfic. And writer Greg Kasavin’s wonderful script is wittier, wiser and flirtier than ever.”Read the full review.Hollow Knight: SilksongView image in fullscreenHollow Knight: Silksong.Photograph: ROGOne of the biggest hits of 2025, this platform adventure sequel drags insectoid princess Hornet into the haunted realm of Pharloom, where relentless enemies and fiendishly tough puzzles await. Nightmarishly difficult and compelling, it’s up there with the greatest Metroidvania titles of all time.Why we love it:“I’m captivated by Silksong. I’ve spent 15 hours on it in three days, and it has made my thumbs hurt.”Read more.Kirby and the Forgotten LandView image in fullscreenKirby and the Forgotten Land.Photograph: NintendoThe first 3D platforming adventure for Hal Laboratory’s long-running hero sees Kirby wake up in a magical world terrorised by a gang of animals known as the Beast Pack. The Switch 2 edition updates the visuals and adds a whole new story.Why we love it:“From scaling overgrown tower blocks to navigating ghost-ridden haunted house rides in a creature-infested theme park, it feels endlessly inventive.”Read the full review.The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom – Switch 2 editionView image in fullscreenThe Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom.Photograph: NintendoThe follow-up to 2017’sBreath of the Wildreturns us to the world of Hyrule, now shattered by a cataclysmic event. Familiar locations are radically changed, fresh secrets and quests are revealed, and a new physics engine lets you build incredible contraptions.Why we love it:“The sense of freedom here is intoxicating. The kingdom of Hyrule is vast and full of diversions, and being able to move freely between the skies and the ground down below is a thrill that never wears off.”Read the full review.Mario Kart WorldView image in fullscreenMario Kart World.Photograph: NintendoA new beginning for Nintendo’s beloved karting series sees a vast open world to race in, alongside gorgeous circuits, cars, characters and abilities. Implementation of the Switch 2’s GameChat system makes online play more sociable – and the music is incredible.Why we love it:“It really is an impressively welcoming game, this, generous and detailed and unfailingly fun, different but with the same spirit.”Read the full review.Metroid Prime RemasteredView image in fullscreenMetroid Prime Remastered.Photograph: NintendoArguably one of the greatest first-person sci-fi shooters ever made, Metroid Prime was a huge hit on the GameCube in 2002 before receiving a wonderful remaster on the Switch. Series hero Samus Aran finds herself on the poisoned planet of Tallon IV, exploring its haunted biomes and fighting hideous space creatures. Inspired by Ridley Scott’s Alien, it is tense, complex and often scary – things we rarely expect from a Nintendo title.Why we love it:“Sometimes, you play a game from a decades ago and think, this might actually hit better now. Metroid Prime Remastered is one of those games.”Read more.Pokémon Legends: Z-AView image in fullscreenPokemon Legends: Z-A.Photograph: NintendoIn the sprawling, Paris-esque Lumiose City, a team of young trainers set out to climb the ranks of the biggestPokémontournament in town. Arriving as an eager newcomer, you must help them – and save the city from rogue mega-evolved Pokémon. A fresh, interesting take on the series, with more lively battles, an open world to explore and, of course, hundreds of Poké-friends to make along the way.Why we love it:“It looks better than every other Pokémon game I’ve played, and if I could show this to my 11-year-old self playing on a monochrome Game Boy screen, she’d lose her mind.”Read more.Simogo Legacy CollectionView image in fullscreenSimogo Legacy Collection.Photograph: SimogoIn the early days of the Apple App Store, Swedish studio Simogo made some of the most fascinating, beautifully designed touchscreen games of all time, from rhythm action platformers to folk horror adventures. This collection brings them all together with extra features, including early prototypes of the games.Why we love it:“These games, in all their varied playfulness, are full of longing: for a lover, for meaning, for a chance to write your own ending. Play them and dream about a world where it all went differently.”Read the full review.Skate StoryView image in fullscreenSkate Story.Photograph: Devolver DigitalImagine Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater, but set in a demonic underworld that you must escape by rolling through bizarre crystalline hellscapes while pulling off bodacious moves. A surreal and spiritual take on the skating sim.Why we love it:“Beyond the ravishing visuals, what’s most striking is the exquisite fluidity, the delicious ‘gamefeel’ of the actual skateboarding.”Read the full review.Split FictionView image in fullscreenSplit Fiction.Photograph: Electronic ArtsTwo authors – one writing sci-fi, the other fantasy – are sucked into their own stories when a virtual reality machine goes awry. From the makers of the award-winningIt Takes Two, this is another cooperative adventure in which players work in tandem to solve ingenious puzzles.Why we love it:“One level could be all-action space-blasting, the next will have you puzzling through a fantasy jungle as transforming animals, and an unexpected diversion will have you working together to wriggle sentient hotdogs into buns.”Read more.Street Fighter 6View image in fullscreenStreet Fighter 6.Photograph: CapcomThe warriors return for another showdown, featuring classic combatants and new fighters, such as drunken boxer Jamie and graffiti ninja Kimberly. The special moves are eye-popping and the gorgeous, hyper-colourful visuals hit you harder than Ryu’s hadouken.Why we love it:“It’s bursting at the seams with things to do, assured in its gameplay, and wrapped in a stylish, colourful, confident swagger that the game can absolutely back up.”Read the full review.Two Point MuseumView image in fullscreenTwo Point Museum.Photograph: Two Point Studios/SegaDesign the perfect museum then send out explorers to discover artefacts in the latest management game from the makers of the equally great Two Point Hospital andTwo Point Campus. The simulation is complex and demanding but it’s softened by lovely comic touches.Why we love it:“Takes all the lessons from the previous games and builds on them to make a thoughtful and hugely entertaining contribution to the management sim genre.”Read the full review.Looking for more games to play?

Don’t expect the US to take actionMoira DoneganElon Musk’s reckless and degrading AI could be built differently. But Americans will have to speak upFri 9 Jan 2026 14.15 ESTFirst published on Fri 9 Jan 2026 08.00 ESTShareOver the past year,Elon Muskhas made a series of protocol changes to Grok, the proprietary AI chatbot of his company xAI, which runs prominently on his social media site X, formerly Twitter. Many of these changes have been geared to make the bot more amenable to producing pornography. In August, Grok launched an image generator, branded as Grok Imagine, which featured a service geared toward creating nude, suggestive or sexually explicit content, including computer-generated pornographic images of real women. The feature, which was quickly used to create naked images of celebrities such as Taylor Swift, also allowed users to create brief videos, complete with animations and sounds.Musk also rolled out AI girlfriends on the platform: animated personas – including female characters with exaggerated breasts and hips – that interacted in sexually explicit ways with users. One of the characters, “Ani”, was an anime-style cartoon blonde with a series of skimpy outfits; the bot blew kisses and addressed users as “my love” while directing the chats toward sexual content.Later last fall, an internal update to Grokpushed the bot towards darker and more extreme content. Though the sexualization of children was technically disallowed in the bot’s internal prompts, the bot’s instructions from xAI state that “‘teenage’ or ‘girl’ does not necessarily imply underage”. The instructions also emphasize that the bot should not observe any restrictions on the darkness or violence of sexual content,the Atlantic reported. Taken together, these updates allow the bot to create realistic images of real, living “teenagers” or “girls” – along with adult women or anybody else – for the sake of users’ sexual gratification.Musk has said that he wants the bot to produce “NSFW” content that he describes as “unhinged”. Users have obliged. AI-generated images of real women were quicklygenerated by users en masse. Men and others were able to use the product to harass women they knew – to take revenge on old girlfriends, humiliate co-workers, classmates, family members and acquaintances, and to express domination or contempt for strangers, internet personalities, celebrities and ordinary users. “@Grok put her in a bikini” or “@Grok take her clothes off” or “@Grok spread her legs” becameregular responsesto any images women post of themselves – or which are posted by others – on the platform. Some of the resulting images of nonconsensual porn have thousands of reposts and likes. The risk and reality of being subject to nonconsensual, AI-generated porn – and to having those images go viral on the large social-media platform where the generator was embedded – quickly became a new tax on women’s presence online and in the public sphere, a tax that women must pay with their dignity. Musk and his companies’ interventions have had a ripple effect on women’s civil rights, limiting their access to the public sphere by making that public sphere hostile and intimately degrading to women at a massive scale.X removed a number of these images, but many remained online, and it seems few users have been suspended for making them. As of this week,the bot had notbeen effectively changed toprevent this kind of abuse. As if in a parody of the allergy felt by the tech industry – and by Musk in particular – to all kinds of responsibility or moral seriousness, these sexualized and abuse-facilitating features on X’s AI products are marked with a cloyingly childish name: “spicy mode”.Now, Musk and xAI’s recklessness and idiotic disregard for the harms of unregulated pornography have been taken to their logical end point: X was awash inAI-generated child sexual abuse material. Female users reported having their childhood pictures turned into nearly naked images by the bot, at the request of users. Some X accounts asked the bot to remove clothing from images of a then12-year-old actor who recently appearedon Stranger Things.An account associated with the Grok bot issued a statement saying: “we’ve identified lapses in safeguards and are urgently fixing them.” On Friday, Grok announced it would turn off the image-generating function for users who are not paying subscribers, butthe Verge foundits tools “remain readily available for any X user”. Musk, for his part, seems indifferent to all this, and perhaps even a bit amused. Hehas said: “Anyone using Grok to make illegal content will suffer the same consequences as if they upload illegal content” – but he has also responded to posts about the ongoing problem of deepfake porn on his site with a series of laughing-face and flame emojis. Reporting from CNN suggests Musk has been highly resistant to what he sees ascensorshipof Grok, and has expressed frustration with restrictions on the bot in recent weeks, before the eruption of the child sexual abuse material controversy.Regulatory action will not be forthcoming; at least not in the US. The Trump administration, meanwhile, hasintervened to try to stop all state-level efforts to curb AI abuses, signing an executive order in December aimed at mooting state regulations of AI meant to nullify safety and consumer protection efforts. The move comes as the Trump administration adopts an exceedingly generous regulatory posture towards AI as tech companies makemajorcontributions to Trump’scampaign,inauguralandballroomfunds.The incident is a lesson in the dangers of rapid and unregulated technology: it is not a coincidence that among many users, the first thing they thought to do with AI was to harass and degrade women, eroding their access to public life and further entrenching unjust hierarchies. But the power of technology, here, seems secondary to the power of wealth. xAI, its chatbot and image-generating products could be built differently if the priorities of the man who controls them were different. If a man of Musk’s low – intellect, addled brain, insipid humor and gross, self-gratifying misogyny were not the richest person in the world, then the world would not be subject to his indignity. Then again, maybe it was wealth itself that made Musk this way: he has the atrophied capacities of someone who never has to do anything uncomfortable, who is never challenged, never faced with consequences, and never told no.Either way, the only way out of the mess that Musk and Grok have created is to tax Musk enough so that he is no longer so rich that the failures of his character shape the public sphere – that his seeming indifference to the nonconsensual and child sexual abuse material his companies have created no longer results in misogynist, sexualized degradation for Grok’s victims and the public at large. We don’t have to live like this: we can take Musk’s power to hurt and degrade us away from him. We can stop his idiocy from being our problem. The Trump administration will not take on the responsibility of freeing America from the consequences of Musk’s money.

But Donald Trump’s threats to intervene won’t help civiliansFri 9 Jan 2026 12.52 ESTLast modified on Fri 9 Jan 2026 15.10 ESTShareTheinternet blackoutacross Iran is meant to prevent protests from spreading, and observers from witnessing the crackdown on them. But it’s also emblematic of the deep uncertainty surrounding this unrest and the response of a regime under growing pressure.Rocketing inflation and a tanking currency sparked the protests in late December. They have since broadened andspread. Videos showed thousands marching in Tehran on Thursday night and people setting fire to vehicles and state-owned buildings.Regime opponents – not least in the diaspora – have often predicted its demise. The politically‑focused Green movement of 2009 was brutally suppressed. Ten years later, a harsh crackdown ended economically-prompted unrest. The current protests are smaller than those of the Woman, Life, Freedom movement at its 2022 peak. But they began in parts of society that have been more supportive of the regime, and have quickly escalated, with some participants explicitly demanding its fall.NGOs say dozens of people – including children – have already been killed. The supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, initially acknowledged “legitimate” economic demands. Now he ishardening his attackupon “saboteurs” who he says are seeking to please Donald Trump, after the US president threatened to intervene and “hit hard” if more protesters died. The head of the judiciary said the consequences for demonstrators would be “decisive, maximum and without any legal leniency”.Yet while authorities have always managed to crush protests, they have not succeeded in addressing the causes – and they now face simultaneous internal and external threats. Their economic room for manoeuvre ismore limitedthan ever. The supreme leader is 86 years old and has suffered poor health. Iran’s axis of resistance is severely degraded and June’s 12-day war with Israel – plus the US attack on nuclear facilities – shattered the belief that the regime could provide physical security for its people even though it failed them economically. It no longer looks impregnable.Following his reckless and illegal seizure of Venezuela’sNicolás Maduro, Mr Trump’s threats may give the leadership some pause for thought. But they have also allowed it to delegitimise Iranian citizens with genuine, deeply held grievances as the pawns of foreign aggressors.Flush with victory from the Venezuela decapitation, Mr Trump seems to believe that there are easy wins from foreign intervention.Benjamin Netanyahuhas talked up the possibility that “Iranian people are taking their fate into their own hands” and has a history of persuading the US president into reckless and dangerous ventures. An Iran embroiled in domestic chaos would suit the Israeli prime minister well. But Iranian civilians and others in the region would pay the price.Destabilisation might lead to an entrenchment, not weakening, of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps’s power. Iran’s defence council this weeksignalledthat it could take preemptive military action if it saw “objective signs of threat” from the US and Israel. That attempt to restore deterrence might be bluster – but shows that the region is entering a riskier era. Whether the regime persists or is gradually approaching the end of the road, there can be no easy exit. Those who claim they want to help, while cynically seeking to exploit the legitimate grievances of Iranian citizens for their own ends, only risk more bloodshed and suffering.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It should galvanise all those who oppose himFri 9 Jan 2026 12.24 ESTLast modified on Fri 9 Jan 2026 15.10 ESTShareFor a serial liar, Donald Trump can be bracingly honest. We’ve known about the mendacity for years – consider the30,573 documented falsehoodsfrom the president’s first term, culminating in the big lie, his claim to have won the 2020 election – but the examples of bracing candour are fresher. This week both began and ended with the US president speaking the shocking truth.At a press conference to celebrate his capture of the Venezuelan dictator Nicolás Maduro, Trumpannounced thatfrom now on the US would “run” that country, before moving in the very next breath to Venezuela’s oil. There was no pious talk of democracy, scant mention even of the drug trafficking that earlier served as a pretext for military action. Instead, Trump said out loud what had once been a slogan on leftist placards in protest at past US interventions, admitting that it really was all about the oil. It was as transparent a revelation of Trump’s true motive as you could have asked for.As the week closed, there was another disarmingly frank disclosure from the president, a confession that makes sense of both the crazy start to 2026 – and the man who is increasingly shaping our world.Before we get to that statement, it’s worth registering how hard it can be to square these flashes of Trumpian honesty with the stream of untruths and, more subtly, contradictions and hypocrisies that emanate from him the rest of the time. Note, for example, Trump’s response when asked for his new year resolution: “Peace. Peace on Earth,” he said. Two days later, he wasraining lethal fireon Caracas – and a few days after that, he was defending a US federal agent who hadshot dead a mother of threein Minneapolis, a woman who posed no conceivable threat to anyone. The self-styled President of Peace is the bringer of war at home and abroad.These two fronts are more alike than they might seem. The common thread is rule by fear. Trump’s aim in Venezuela has been to remove Maduro and hope that fear will do the rest. No need for a boots-on-the-ground occupation or “second wave” military assault; no need even for regime change. Removal of the man at the top should be enough to intimidate Maduro’s erstwhile henchmen, and especiallyhis chief henchwoman, into doing the US’s bidding, starting with the handover of its oil industry.What’s more, fear is contagious. Cuba has most reason to be anxious, but Trump alsowarned Colombia’s leaderto “watch his ass”, while signalling that he isconsidering airstrikes on Mexico, aimed at drug cartels he says are now running that country. The mere threat of a repeat of last weekend’s action on Venezuela may well be enough to bring the rest of the Americas to heel.That fear reaches across the Atlantic. Trump’s desire for Greenland was once dismissed as a punchline, but after Venezuela no one is laughing. Now we know that Trump’s words are the best guide to his future actions: if he says he wants something, he may well take it. In truth, the US’s European allies have been governed by fear since the day 11 months ago when Trumphumiliated Volodymr Zelenskyyin the Oval Office: they worry that if they stand up to the bully in the White House, the bully will turn on them. Specifically, they fear that if they complain about Trump’s designs on Greenland, he will pull the plug on US support for Ukraine.But, to Trump, fear is not only a commodity for export. It is how he rules at home too. Much has been made of his campaign of intimidation of US institutions, from the media to the universities to the courts. Rather less attention has been paid to his efforts to intimidate the American public, to make ordinary US citizens frightened of their own government.But that is where we are now. For many months, masked agents of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, have been snatching people off the streets and meting out brutal punishment to those who get in their way. Witnesses in Minneapolisdescribed an“insane” scene on Thursday, 24 hours after the killing of 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good: “Large convoys of heavily armed masked men, blocking off streets at random, grabbing people nearly at random.” It’s always illuminating to report this as we would if it were happening somewhere far away: “Heavily armed government militias are roaming unchecked through US cities and shooting human rights observers dead in the streets,” to quotethe New Republic’s Greg Sargent. On Thursday border patrol agents in Portland, Oregonshot two peopleoutside a hospital.Fuelling the fear are the lies. Trump pretended his beef with Maduro was the supply of narcotics into the US, even though it is hardly Venezuelan drugs that arekilling Americans– and even as he, Trump, had just pardoned and released the ex-president of Honduras, who had beenconvicted and jailedfor flooding the US with 400 tonnes of cocaine.The lies at home are even more egregious. On the killing of Good, Trump and his officials have urged Americans to disbelieve their own eyes, insisting that Good was a “domestic terrorist” bent on using her car as a weapon whenvideo footage of the incidentleaves no doubt that she was not trying to kill ICE agents, but to get away from them. The lying never stops, even when that means defaming the dead. JD Vancecalled the slain womana “deranged leftist”.Of course, what these assaults, domestic and foreign, have in common is the drive for power, free of challenge or restraint. South American countries are to submit, as are Democrat-run cities and states. Whether it’s sending special forces to Caracas or ordering the National Guard into Los Angeles and Washington DC, the goal is control.Which brings us to that second eruption of honesty. At the end of the week,Trump told the New York Timesthat he recognises only one constraint on his ability to act: “My own morality. My own mind. It’s the only thing that can stop me.” All the other official checks or balances are as nothing. His disregard for international law is total, but he sees domestic law much the same way: judges only have the power to restrain him “under certain circumstances”, he told the NYT.That is an honest account by Trump of how he sees himself: not so much a national president as a global emperor. Now those who oppose him have to be just as honest. Trump may be right that the US arsenal is such that no country can stand up to him, and certainly not alone. But the major European powers, and others, do have leverage, especially if they act in concert. More directly, the US public has a formidable weapon in its hands: it can vote to wrest the House of Representatives, at least, from the Republicans in November, which will act as an instant curb on Trump’s power. At home and abroad, it means overcoming fear, combining together and admitting the menace we now confront – and doing so honestly.Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnistGuardian newsroom: Year One of Trumpism: Is Britain Emulating the US?On Wednesday 21 January 2026, join Jonathan Freedland, Tania Branigan and Nick Lowles as they reflect on the first year of Donald Trump’s second presidency.

But there hasn’t been nearly enough focus on the domestic implications of Trump’s move.Trump seems to have ordered his Venezuela venture in part to flip the script away from domestic matters, where things aren’t going well for him. Hisapproval ratings are underwater, and he’s getting low marks on theeconomy,health policy(just 30% approval), inflation (31% approval on the cost of living), his immigration crackdown (41% approval) and his sending thenational guard into US cities. Then there’s thebig thumbs downthat Americans are giving to his tariffs, which have helped push up prices even though candidate Trump promisedto lower prices on day one.With his plan to capture Nicolás Maduro, Trump sought to chalk up an easy victory to make himself look good. But his efforts to flip the script aren’t going so great. A Reuters/Ipsos poll shows that just33% of Americans supporthis military strike in Venezuela, with 72% saying they are worried the US will become too involved there. The US attacked Venezuela on 3 January, and anEconomist/YouGov pollfrom 2-5 January found that among US men, Trump’s approval rating rose 4 percentage points from the previous week, while it fell by 5 points among women.WithMarjorie Taylor Greene leading the way, many Maga folks have criticized the Venezuela attack, seeing it as abetrayal of Trump’s “America First”promises. Many of them supported Trump in large part because he promised no more forever wars, no more misguided foreign ventures and an overwhelming focus on domestic issues.After the Venezuela attack, Greene noted that past foreign entanglements resulted in US troops getting bogged down and “many flag-draped coffinscom[ing] home”. She said that when she voted for Trump, she voted for “no more foreign wars, no more regime change and putting the American people first”, which, she said, meant helping people “afford healthcare” and helping them be “able to buy a home” and to “live the American dream”.Many Maga supporters will be asking hard questions about how in the world Trump’s attack on Venezuela will help them. It certainly won’t do much to bring them affordable healthcare – an issue where Trump and Republicans are on defense after lawmakers stubbornly blocked Democratic efforts to extend subsidies for Obamacare, a move that willincrease premiums for more than 22 million Americans. The Venezuela attack will do little or nothing to improve affordability, although Trump boasted that he would commandeer – some might say steal –up to 50m barrels of oilfrom Venezuela to, he hopes, help push down gas prices a bit. (Trump says he’s gotten Venezuelan officials to agree to this.)Some Americans will no doubt applaud any effort to reduce gasoline prices, but many must feel uncomfortable with the way Trump is doing this, adopting the philosophy of a schoolyard bully: since I’m bigger than you, anything you own is mine, unless I let you keep certain things.Let’s not forget, with Zohran Mamdani and other Democrats winning big on affordability issues in November, Trump is supposed totravel around the country to give speechesin which he, if he can keep to the script, boasts that he cares big-time about affordability. For the moment, those plans seem deep on the back burner, while Trump’s focus is Venezuela, Venezuela, Venezuela and oil, oil, oil.Americans aren’t blind, and they can see that Trump’s military strike was largely about helping an industry that many Americans detest:the oil industry. Many Americans, including Maga folks, support democracy and freedom, but Trump has made crystal-clear that that’s not why he attacked Venezuela. Instead, it’s to help multibillion-dollar US oil companies, for which Trump hasalready donemassive and myriad favors.Many Americans will no doubt grow increasingly upset with Trump’s Venezuela adventure after he suggested that US taxpayers might pay billions of dollars to help ExxonMobil, Chevron and other US oil companies rebuild Venezuela’s oil industry (and thereby help make tons of money for themselves). Trump sounded tone-deaf to the concerns of US taxpayers when he said: “A tremendous amount of moneywill have to be spent, and the oil companies will spend it, and then they’ll get reimbursed by us or through [tax] revenue.”If the Democrats are smart, they will make the case loud and clear that Trump’sVenezuelaattack is all about helping giant oil corporations while doing little to help average Americans. The millions of young people who are deeply concerned about the environment and global warming will grow angrier still at Trump because, with his Venezuela power play, he is once again doing everything he can to expand fossil fuel production while showing zero concern about global warming.Trump’s military strike is essentially a Wag the Dog effort to divert the public’s attention from his problems on the home front. Trump promised tocut electricity prices in halfwithin 12 months, but they have kept climbing since he returned to office. Trump vowed to lower prices on day one, but inflation, at 2.7%, isrunning just a tad lowerthan when Biden left office. Trump said he’d chop the budget deficit, but his “big beautiful bill”, with its huge tax cuts for the ultra-rich, is likely to increase the nation’smountain of debt by $3.8tn.After the US military’s quick execution of its mission to capture Maduro, things in Venezuela might get far messier and increasingly distract Trump from focusing on the domestic issues, including affordability and healthcare, that Americans care about. Trump gloated in the hours after Maduro was captured, but his Venezuela venture could still turn out to be a quagmire, and even a disaster, just as Iraq did for George W Bush after he prematurely boasted “mission accomplished”. Trump and US oil companies must be praying that some patriotic, anti-imperialistic Venezuelans don’t sabotage and blow up the billions in oil-drilling and refining equipment that Trump says US companies will invest in Venezuela. Such sabotage would be a big embarrassment to Trump.Let’s hope that Venezuela doesn’t turn into a quagmire with many US troops deployed there, although Trump said this week that the US could beentangled there for years to comeand “we’re not afraid of [having US]boots on the ground” in Venezuela. Unfortunately, Trump’s readiness to put boots on the ground in Venezuela could lead to deaths of US soldiers.As a candidate,Trump promisedto “keep our country out of ... endless wars” and said “we must abandon the failed policy ofnation-building and regime change”. In hisinaugural address last January, Trump said the US would “stop all wars and bring a new spirit of unity to a world that has been angry, violent and totally unpredictable”.Many Americans can plainly see that Trump has reversed course. Like George W Bush in Iraq, Trump is promising a brief military venture and no quagmire. But if Trump, after years of saying he opposes “endless wars” and nation-building, gets bogged down in Venezuela – it might erupt into a civil war – he can expect many Americans, including Maga supporters, to feel angry at, and betrayed by, the America First president.Steven Greenhouse is a journalist and author, focusing on labour and the workplace, as well as economic and legal issuesExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionUS domestic policyVenezuelaOil and gas companiesTrump administrationUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

While this was not the only period of transition the country would experience (since the process that began in 1958 consolidated a more open and enduring political regime), thetransition of 1936was longer and more complex, resembling the one Venezuelans are now experiencing after thecapture of Nicolás Maduroon 3 January 2026.Coromoto Escalona, a 35-year-old woman, was preparing her baby’s feeding bottle when she heard some strange noises in the house. It was two o’clock in the morning. She wondered whether the fridge had broken down, since it sometimes made strange noises when it was damaged. Her eldest daughter, who was scrolling on WhatsApp, shouted from her room: “Mum, they’re bombing us.” The two of them stopped what they were doing, grabbed the essentials – the feeding bottle, water and some food – and ran to an underground room in their house, an old colonial mansion in La Pastora, a working-class neighbourhood in central Caracas.Coromoto’s testimony is one of many you hear in Caracas these days, a week after the US military attack on the Venezuelan capital which concluded with the capture of Maduro. The event, other Caracas residents recount, felt like a repeat of what they experienced on 4 February 1992, when the city was also bombed – not by the US, but byHugo Chávez’s military officers, who had risen up against the existing democratic system. The structure in place at the time of Chávez’s strikes had taken many years to achieve and consolidate – just over three decades in the past century.To understand the depth of this moment, it is necessary to step back to 1936, when Venezuelans first experienced what a political transition meant: a shift towards democracy with relative guarantees of freedom, as is often the case in such contexts. After the death ofJuan Vicente Gómezin December 1935 – hitherto the longest-ruling dictator in the country’s history – his minister of war,Eleazar López Contreras, succeeded him in the presidency and was able to steer the nation towards a moderately democratic regime: political prisons were opened, freedom of speech was granted and a modernisation programme was designed.At that time, at least two factors were required: political will and sustained pressure from the streets. The demonstration of 14 February 1936 served as a catalyst for the reforms that followed, despite leaving several casualties. This does not mean there were no contradictions: in the 1936 transition – a term used by one of the protagonists of the moment,Ramón Díaz Sánchez– there was also repression and persecution of those who thought differently. It was not a spontaneous and immediate change.Although this transition was the most complex in Venezuela’s history, it was not the country’s only experience of political change. In 1958, Venezuelan society once again experienced a similar scenario: the fall ofMarcos Pérez Jiménez(for many, Venezuela’s last dictator of the 20th century), when a consensual regime based on political parties and alternation in power was established – a system that, despite its lights and shadows, became the most solid in Latin America. The country opened its doors to thousands of migrants from Europe, Latin America and the Middle East; ensured peaceful transfers of power between two different parties; developed its oil production to its fullest potential; and succeeded in neutralising the prevailing extremism of the cold war.It was precisely against this political regime that Chávez’s actions were directed in 1992, for which he ended up in prison. The existence of a rule of law allowed him to be released and to assume the presidency without major setbacks in February 1999, under the slogan of refounding the state with the ideals ofSimón Bolívar, the principal figure of national independence, and in the name of those most in need. The concentration of power brought about by thenew constitutionexpanded the president’s authority to unprecedented levels. What followed was predictable in such circumstances: power was exercised for personal convenience and wielded against those he regarded as enemies. Before his death in March 2013, he urged voters to support Maduro – then his vice-president – should he become permanently absent.Trump’s Venezuela incursion has nothing to do with its freedom | Judith LevineRead moreAnd so it came to pass: in 2013, Venezuelanselected Maduroas president in a controversial vote. The social outlook was already bleak, as the decisions taken under Chávez were beginning to exact a heavy toll on the economy. What followed was yet another transition – one that, unlike those of 1936 and 1958, did not point towards democracy but towards a more oppressive regime marked by totalitarian features. Maduro forcefully repressed the opposition, persecuted and tortured thousands, killed hundreds and drove millions of Venezuelans into exile. He aligned himself with some of the world’s least democratic regimes, which exploited the country’s resources in exchange for strategic, anti-western alliances. In July 2024, hedisregarded the resultsof the elections and forced opposition leaders underground.That remained the case until 3 January 2026 – or, at least, that is how it appears a week after Donald Trump’s attack. Today, Venezuelans once again find themselves facing a dilemma of political transition, uncertain whether it will lead to a democratic system or yet another form of authoritarian rule. After 27 years of the latter, we naturally hope for the former. This hope is reflected in calls for the release of political prisoners, an end to media censorship, respect for human rights and the return of those forced into exile.None of this has occurred so far. Yet there is a palpable tension in the air, oscillating between fear and a cautious sense of celebration – not because we place blind faith in Trump, whose interests do not necessarily align with Venezuelan democratisation, but because we sense that this moment carries a genuine opportunity for change. Nor is this sentiment rooted in the belief that history is cyclical, or that it simply “rhymes”, as Mark Twain once suggested. Rather, it arises from Venezuela’s own experience: as history shows, this is not the first time the country has faced a moment of this kind in its republican past.Jesús Piñero is a journalist and a historian at the Central University of VenezuelaDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Now we need a plan to manage the risks we’ve set in motionFri 9 Jan 2026 06.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 9 Jan 2026 12.14 ESTShareAfew months ago, Marjorie Taylor Greene, then a Georgia representative, held ahearingon her bill to ban research on “geoengineering”, which refers to technologicalclimateinterventions, such as using reflective particles to reflect away sunlight. The hearing represented something of a first – a Republican raising alarm bells about human activity altering the health of the planet. Of course, for centuries, people have burned fossil fuels to power and feed society, emitting greenhouse gases that now overheat the planet.Unfortunately, her hearing waved past an urgent debate that policymakers are confronting around the world: after centuries of accidental fossil-fuel geoengineering, should we deliberately explore interventions to cool the planet and give the energy transition breathing room?For some, even asking this question is taboo. On the right, Greene is not alone: anti-vaxxers and chemtrail conspiracy theorists are pushing to criminalize research across states and on Capitol Hill. On the left, some argue it’s a “moral hazard” even to acknowledge we might need tools beyond mitigation.But two inconvenient truths should force us to reject geoengineering research bans and reappraise climate strategy. First, the Earth’s climate system appears more sensitive to greenhouse gases than once hoped. Second, we are not reducing those gases nearly fast enough. Not only do we need research on other tools; we need it sooner than we thought.Catastrophic impacts and dangerous feedback loops are becoming more likely, yet we continue to plan as if business as usual can hold. The math of solving the problem was already daunting, even before federal attacks on climate regulations and research. As longtime climate advocates and former public officials, we believe it’s time for a more honest conversation about what lies ahead – and what must now be done to prepare.We’ve each spent decades working on emissions reduction and clean-energy policy. We still believe mitigation is essential and must accelerate. But the conviction that mitigation will be sufficient – on its own, and in time – is no longer tenable.We have already altered the planet. Through greenhouse-gas release, we’ve disrupted Earth’s energy balance, triggered feedback loops, and pushed key systems closer to collapse. In effect, we have already geoengineered the climate – just without intention, governance or regard for consequences.Scientists are increasingly alarmed. James Hansen, a foundational figure in climate science, has warned that the likelihood of a much hotter Earth is accelerating. In addition to wrapping the planet in heat-trapping gases, reflective ice is disappearing, clouds are shifting, and particulate pollution is increasing. The planet is, quite literally, darkening.As warming quickens, so do the risks of irreversible damage. We would never simply stand by and hope for the best if this were any other threat of this scale. Yet we have no global plan beyond hoping mitigation goes faster.We are not being honest – with ourselves or the public – about how little we’ve done to prepare for worst-case scenarios. Holistic planning to manage these risks and drive energy transition and land-use reform is not a distraction; it is the necessary next step in responsible climate action.Cutting greenhouse gases remains the only long-term solution, and there are positive signs we are constraining the growth rate of human-made emissions. But we started late, and our changed climate may mean that natural carbon cycles stop mopping up half of what we emit. If that happens, our ability to avert dangerous impacts is vastly reduced.We need a broader, more inclusive plan. That means significantly expanding investments in adaptation, resilience and emergency preparedness. It also means exploring, with care and rigor, potential interventions that might reduce peak warming or slow dangerous feedbacks. And it means rejecting efforts to dismantle research when we most need answers.Some ideas – such as reflecting sunlight with particles or brightening marine clouds to counteract the darkening under way – would be temporary interventions that could buy time and head off enormous consequences. We must start by developing credible options, then discard those that won’t work while maturing those that might. We are not calling for deployment of any climate intervention. We are calling for truly knowing our options so policymakers can make informed choices instead of emergency decisions.A serious research program is how the world gains real choices. To shut down inquiry is to close off the path to knowledge we need to separate the reckless from the responsible. The alternative is far worse: a future where decisions are made in crisis, under pressure, and without preparation.Some argue that even discussing climate interventions creates a “moral hazard”. But refusing to consider potentially life-saving options is not moral clarity – it’s moral failure. Climate justice means protecting people from suffering. That requires a plan that integrates mitigation, adaptation and risk reduction together. This work will have to be done. The only question is when, and by whom. Right now, we still have a window to shape it in ways that are safe, just, and globally inclusive. We need more leaders, more funders and more governments to engage – not to replace existing climate strategies, but to complement and complete them.It’s easy to dismiss ideas; the harder work is to identify which approaches might actually help, and to prepare before an escalating crisis forces our hand.Craig Segall is the former deputy executive officer and assistant chief counsel of the California Air Resources Board.

We must peacefully say no to this violenceFri 9 Jan 2026 05.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 9 Jan 2026 15.25 ESTShareOn 25 May 2020, America witnessed a stunning act of police brutality when a police officer in Minneapolis, Minnesota,murdered George Floyd. The killer, Derek Chauvin, apparently confident that he would be immune to accountability, did his deed in the open, with other officers standing by and in front of a crowd of onlookers.Thevideo of Floyd’s murdershocked the nation.Fast forward to 7 January 2026, and barely a mile from the spot where Chauvin killed Floyd, an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agentshot and killed Renee Nicole Good, a 37-year-old mother of three. She had no criminal record and had just dropped one of her children at school.Good, whodescribed herselfas a “poet and writer and wife and mom” had only recently moved to Minneapolis from Kansas City, Missouri. The Associated Press reports that her ex-husbandsaid“she was no activist and that he had never known her to participate in a protest of any kind. He described her as a devoted Christian who took part in youth mission trips to Northern Ireland when she was younger.”What could be more American?Her “crime” was her refusal to meekly submit to ICE’s desire to rule the streets of her city.Again, the killingwas done out in the open, with other ICE agents also on the scene. Again, it was done in front of a crowd of onlookers who were stunned by the brutality of what they witnessed. Their cellphone videos have gone viral and given Americans the chance to see for themselves what violence done by agents of our government looks like.In 2020, Floyd’s murdergalvanizednationwide protests calling for reform, including some that demanded defunding of the police. The question is, how will the American people react to Good’s death?It is up to us to say “no” to what we saw and to demand that ICE be reined in. We can and should do so lawfully, peacefully and without resorting to violence.One doesn’t have to be a radical to see that what happened on the streets ofMinneapolisin 2020, just like what happened there five and a half years later, is an instance of people whose duty it is to uphold the law and protect the American people not doing all they can to avoid resorting to violence.When the ICE agents arrived at the scene where Good’s car was partly blocking the street, they immediately started shouting and issuing expletive-laden commands to her. One of them rushed to her vehicle and tried to open the driver’s side door.It all happened in a flash and was frightening to watch, even before the shooting started.ICE agents have killed – again. The Trump administration blames the victim | Moira DoneganRead moreInstead of staying calm and working to de-escalate the situation, the ICE agents made the difficult situation worse. As professors Dr Clemens Lorei and Dr Kerstin Kocabexplain, police officers use de-escalation “techniques every day … While at one time, it may have been relatively rare to … attempt to calm down an agitated member of the public and show them empathy, these skills are becoming more frequently employed in modern policing.”Indeed, ICE’s ownuse-of-force policysays that agents are only authorized to use force when “no reasonably effective, safe and feasible alternative appears to exist”. It instructs them to use “de-escalation” techniques and show “respect for human life”.But those guidelines were issued in 2023, under the Biden administration. They clearly were not followed by the ICE agents, who confronted and killed Good. The New Republicreportsthat sources in the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) agree.The video of the scene shows Good trying to drive away when one of the ICE agents, who appears to be standing to the side of the vehicle, opens fire. He does so at a moment when his life was not in danger.One wishes that Good had not reacted as she did, but she did nothing that justified the use of lethal force.Forty years ago, in 1985, the US supreme courtruledthat police cannot use lethal force just to stop someone from fleeing and escaping. In Tennessee v Garner, they likened the use of such force to a “seizure” of the kind governed by the constitution’s fourth amendment.Writing for the court, Justice Byron White said: “The intrusiveness of a seizure by means of deadly force is unmatched. The suspect’s fundamental interest in his own life need not be elaborated upon. The use of deadly force also frustrates the interest of the individual, and of society, in judicial determination of guilt and punishment.”He explained that lethal force can be used only “if the officer has a good-faith belief that the suspect poses a significant threat of death or serious physical injury to the officer or others”, and only if force is necessary to apprehend a fleeing suspect.A “good-faith belief” means that the use of lethal forcemust be objectively reasonable. Admittedly, the supreme court’s standard does not make such split-second judgments easy.That’s why we demand a high level of training and a disposition toward de-escalation before we give someone a gun and let them loose anywhere in this country. We expect a lot of those who exercise the coercive power of the state.But it seems that under the Trump administration, ICEis resorting to violence as a common tactic. What happened in Minneapoliswas the ninth ICE shooting since September. And it was not the first time federal agents have killed someone amid an immigration crackdown. Last September, for instance, Silverio Villegas Gonzalezwas killedwhen he allegedly tried to flee from a traffic stop.ICEis enacting a vision of a worldthat, to quote Stephen Miller, deputy White House chief of staff, “is governed by strength, that is governed by force, that is governed by power”. America should not accept that view.Justice White offered a better view, a view that would have saved Good’s life: “It is not better that … felony suspects die than that they escape.” That is the view that we should embrace and rally behind in the wake of her death.Austin Sarat, William Nelson Cromwell professor of jurisprudence and political science at Amherst College, is the author or editor of more than 100 books, including Gruesome Spectacles: Botched Executions and America’s Death PenaltyExplore more on these topicsICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)OpinionTrump administrationMinneapolisGeorge FloydMinnesotaUS policingMinnesota ICE shootingcommentShareReuse this content"

Look to the thawing Arctic iceGaby HinsliffForecasts suggest that global heating could create a shortcut from Asia to North America, and new routes for trading, shipping – and attackFri 9 Jan 2026 01.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 9 Jan 2026 07.36 ESTShareAnother week, another freak weather phenomenon you’ve probably never heard of. If it’s not the “weather bomb” of extreme wind and snow that Britain is hunkering down for as I write, it’s reports in the Guardian ofreindeer in the Arctic strugglingwith the opposite problem: unnaturally warm weather leading to more rain that freezes to create a type of snow that they can’t easily dig through with their hooves to reach food. In a habitat as harsh as the Arctic, where survival relies on fine adaptation, even small shifts in weather patterns have endlessly rippling consequences – and not just for reindeer.For decades now, politicians have been warning of the coming climate wars – conflicts triggered by drought, flood, fire and storms forcing people on to the move, or pushing them into competition with neighbours for dwindling natural resources. For anyone who vaguely imagined this happening far from temperate Europe’s doorstep, in drought-stricken deserts or on Pacific islands sinking slowly into the sea, this week’s seemingly unhinged White House talk abouttaking ownership of Greenlandis a blunt wake-up call. As Britain’s first sea lord, General Sir Gwyn Jenkins, has been telling anyone prepared to listen, the unfreezing of the north due to the climate crisis hastriggered a ferocious contestin the defrosting Arctic for some time over resources, territory and strategically critical access to the Atlantic. To understand how that threatens northern Europe, look down at the top of a globe rather than at a map.By the early 2040s,forecasts suggestglobal heating could have rendered the frozen waters around the north pole – the ocean separating Russia from Canada and Greenland – almost ice-free in summer. That potentially opens a new shortcut from Asia to North America, not around the planet’s middle but over the top, creating new routes for trading, shipping, fishing – and, more ominously, for attack.A new theatre of conflict is consequently emerging from under the melting ice, and China, Russia and the US are increasingly locked in a battle for dominance over it. Meanwhile as rising temperatures turn the high north into an autocrat’s chessboard, territories unlucky enough to be in the way – from Greenland to Canada to the Norwegian archipelago of Svalbard,long coveted by Russia– risk becoming pawns.Almost as dangerous for these countries as the threats exposed by a thawing pole are, in a way, the opportunities. Why on earth does the US think it needs to annex friendly Greenland in order to defend this critical Arctic frontier? After all, they’ve had troops stationed on this autonomous Danish territorysince the second world war, and Denmark has obligingly made clear they’remore than welcometo bring more. The one benefit thatdoescome uniquely with ownership, interestingly, is rights to the underground riches that could be unlocked as this frozen country heats up.Greenland is a rare untapped source not just of oil and gas but of therare earth mineralsused to make everything from electric car batteries to datacentre processors – which are to US hopes of winning a technological race with China as rubber from Malaya or cotton from India were to the old colonial economies. Though it’s often a mistake to read too much logical method into the apparent presidential madness, there is no shortage of ideologues and tech bros in Trump’s orbit capable of putting all this together and selling it to him. And while mining the Arctic might not be economically viable for many years yet, Trump’sgrumbles this weekabout Greenland being “full of Chinese and Russian ships everywhere” suggests someone has convinced him that he can’t let rivals beat him to a valuable potential development opportunity, a concept any former real estate mogul can grasp. After all, inUkraine, Trumpsought rights to mine rare earthsin exchange for security guarantees, and in Gaza hemused about building hotelson its bombed-out ruins: why not seek to make a quick buck from environmental catastrophe?And while to Britons all this looks like a new age of empire, for the Maga faithful perhaps there’s an echo of a much more American story, that ofsettlers making their fortune by joining the wagon trail west, pushing the nation’s frontiers endlessly outwards, staking their claim to Indigenous people’s lands and holding grimly on to them through a brutal mix of trade and violence. The aim isn’t to invade Greenland, US secretary of stateMarco Rubio explains, but to buy it, or at least rent exclusive military access. It’s a mark of how fast the relationship between the US and its former allies has collapsed – in just over a year – that this is meant to be reassuring: hey friends, we just want to exploit you, not kill you!Given the president’s legendarily short attention span, it’s difficult to know what fate awaits Greenland. Maybe he’ll simply get bored and move on, especially once themidterms are overand there is less need for drama abroad to distract from failures at home. Or maybe the White House will borrow instead from the Putin playbook, exploiting Greenlanders’ yearning for independence from Denmark to foment the kind of domestic unrest that is so easily whipped up in the age of social media – before pitching the US as a benign saviour riding into town to keep them safe and make them rich.But either way, we had better get used to the idea this is the beginning, not the end, of the conflicts that may come as global heating redraws our maps, unpicks old alliances, and creates new deadly rivalries for land, water and natural resources.Of course it will be worse for those already living on the edge of sustainability, in deserts too parched for anything to grow or in coastal towns already struggling with rising sea levels, or in places too poor to protect themselves from increasingly violent storms, than it will for lucky old temperate Europe. And of course these risks could always be better managed by collaborative governments treating events like the unfreezing of the north as a collective challenge for humans to face together, rather than a deadly race for national advantage.But in the week Trump announced he would bepulling the US out ofa raft of international climate initiatives, that clearly isn’t the world we live in. So if nothing else, let poor beleaguered Greenland be a reminder that the climate crisis will have geopolitical consequences we have barely yet begun to understand, and that whatever we can still do to cap the rising temperature or mitigate its effects still matters. Even, or maybe especially, if we can’t yet undo the damage that has already been so wilfully done.Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsGreenlandOpinionArcticClimate crisisDenmarkDonald TrumpMarco RubioUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

Except, in my dream, I’m digging a hole, trying to beat the rising tide. But for every spadeful of sand I manage to dig out, more keeps filling the hole, no matter how fast I keep digging.I usually wake up in a panic. And then, because I can’t go back to sleep – my mind swirling with all the things I have to remember and all the things I have to do – I just get up, usually around 4am, and start answering emails. Yet it feels as if, for every one I answer, another two appear.While my job is interesting, it’s demanding. I often work 50 hours a week, sometimes 70. I’ve accrued so much time in lieu I have to take seven weeks off over summer.The best way to get round a difficult problem? Do nothing about it | Gaby HinsliffRead moreI know how lucky I am to have that much time off. When people ask me how I’m doing, I reply “busy!Sobusy!”But more and more I don’t want to be busy. I want to belazy. And yet, despite being exhausted by busy-ness, I just can’t do nothing, no matter how hard I try.Most of the time, I feel as if I’m just responding to the alerts that constantly bombard me. I’m constantly running from place to place, swerving from emergency to emergency, trying to juggle work and family as I run out of hours in the day, despite working so many of them.And always struggling to remember what I need to remember to do tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow,in this petty pace from day to day, to the last syllable of recorded time.So why, on rare days off, can’t I just enjoy a sleep in? Orbed rot, as my children and their generation do? Why do I feel guilty doing things I love, as opposed to things I “should” do?Especially just doing nothing at all?Why do we feel the need toschedule every moment,filling every unforgiving minute with a 60 seconds run,so that there’s no time to do nothing?EvenGuardian columnist Adrian Chiles reckons he’s wasted 7,300 hours lazing in bed. But why is it considered a waste – especially compared with hour-long commutes or even longer Zoom meetings where you just sit around while someone drones on?I’m not the only one.Australians work among the longest hours in the developed world,doing up to two months’ unpaid overtime, creating one of the world’s lowest work-life balances.And yet like my dream hole, the more we do the less we actually get done. Despite those increased work hours,productivity has steadily slowed over the past 50 years and plummeted since the 1990s.Let alone the increased stress and diminished physical and mental health that busy-ness inflicts even as we know doing nothing can prevent burnout and refresh our mind, body and spirit, just as sleep does.Consider all those great religious figures – sages,monksandhermits– who withdrew from the world and seemingly did nothing to find enlightenment.But like meditation,doing nothing is hard work. It’s difficult to keep the rush of negative thoughts and to-dos instead of just doing nothing.Don’t believe everything you see: why Buddhist scepticism is vital in the age of generative AI | Bertin HuynhRead moreYet when I recall the moments I’ve felt totally relaxed, I had no sense of what time it was, or what I was meant to be doing, or what anyone else was doing – much likepsychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi’s concept of flow, in which we lose sense of time and our own selves in the moment, giving us a powerful sense of joy and fulfilment.Maybe the answer isnot trying so hard to relax– or anything else. I’ll try my best to do that. Or not.And this summer, when people ask me what I’m up to, like my kids, I’ll just say “nothing.” And mean it.Sunil Badamiis a writer, academic and broadcasterExplore more on these topicsMindfulnessOpinionSummercommentShareReuse this content"

Some would have you believe it has, but I disagree. We’re not very “woke” if we’re still surprised when Black people are kicked out of reality TV shows first. Some people are now arguing that unconscious racial biasmay well be influencingthe outcome ofThe Traitors. But why wouldn’t it? Racial bias influences the outcome of all our lives. I think we are simply watching reality TV reflect reality.We cannot know what is in people’s heads and it is difficult to ascribe motive, butJudy, who was booted out last week, was described by a fellow contestant as being “angry” and “having her back up” when she was accused of being a traitor. This may have been a criticism specific to her – but it also rings alarm bells. I’ve heard this before. Hands up if you’re a Black woman who has been called surly atwork when “assertive” or “confident” would have been more appropriate? There have beencountless studiesof misogynoir (discrimination that uniquely affects Black women) in the workplace and they all come to the same conclusion. Being a Black woman at work means being judged negatively for behaviour that would be innocuous in another person.Perhaps these dynamics are more amplified in The Traitors because suspicion is at the heart of the show. There is no doubt that contestants play in good faith. But the words we hear resonate with many Black viewers. If there is one thing that has impacted the experience of Black people in this country, it’s the accusation of acting and looking suspicious; Ross, who was banished as a suspected traitor in episode four after the faithfuls were told it was “obvious” that it must be him, faced something similar. But so have many others in different, more serious settings. Similar reasons were given by police officers who stopped and searched the vehicle ofBianca Williams and Ricardo dos Santosin 2020. A tribunal in 2023 found they were in fact doing nothing out of the ordinary.What’s interesting is that even though Traitors contestants in this cohort were quick to choose Judy and Ross as suspects, they seem to struggle to give tangible reasons why.A 2023 Independent Office for Police Conduct reportinto stop and search, a tactic used when police only have suspicion to go on, reported thatevery single forcestopped and searched minority-ethnic people disproportionately compared with white counterparts.Not one force could explainthat either.If you look for it, inequitable treatment is everywhere. The furore over Diane Abbottdrinking a can of M&S mojitoon a Transport for London train was equal to the furore overFrank Hester’s racist comments about her. White football players miss penalties all the time – so much so that England’s penalty woes have become etched into legend. But it’s the Black players who receivethe most notable, virulent backlash.Black peoplearetreated differently, and examples of this on reality TV are constant. It was seen whenMisha B was accused of bullyingon the X Factor way back in 2011, and we’ve observed countless Black women rejected early from Love Island. Black contestants such asTameka Empson and Melvin Odoomhave exited Strictly somewhat prematurely despite dancing as competently as, if not better than, their counterparts – a more puzzling one, since I thought dancing is exactly what’s expected of us.I wonder if Judy’s mistake on the Traitors was not fitting in with the stereotypical expectations of Black people that some people consciously and unconsciously have (youthful, cool, unambiguously working class, good dancers …). She was initially perceived as “full of life … cracking jokes all the time”, and then punished later for being “withdrawn”. I’ve noticed that this country takes better to people of colour who affirm, not challenge, their stereotypical ideas about us.Unless reality shows recruit contestants from a time that predates the Barbados Slave Code, which first defined Black people as “less than”, with all the biases and stereotypes that followed, Black and brown contestants will always be vulnerable to assumptions and judgments that negatively impact their chances of success. There is some merit in pontificating about how annoying this is. But we shouldn’t be surprised when our experiences on these shows are consistent with our experiences in real life.The Traitorsis filmed in Scotland, not a post-racial paradise.These reminders of inequitable treatment can feel jarring because Black people in the UK are impactfully represented across the arts, sports, culture and broadcasting. A Black person has read the 10 o’clock news for decades. It doesn’t make any sense that we are a multicultural society that is still distrustful of Black bodies. Our representation is one of the reasons it can be hard to persuade people of the still-rampant racism. A Black woman is the leader of the opposition. We run Mastermind now. Every October we get an all-Black panel on Loose Women. What more could we want?We may be guilty of letting this representation conceal our everyday experiences. When we are headlining Glastonbury or reading out the evening’s headlines, we are in those positions because of decisions that individuals have made. It is not because of a round of voting or some kind of national democratic process. These reality shows serve only to remind us that if our presence was up for any kind of national debate, it’s an argument we might not win.

Since the US president took office, Sánchez has typically referred to the US administration and its president without explicitly naming him. This was initially interpreted as a calculation designed toavoid personal confrontation, but even without using Trump’s name, Sánchez has managed to deliver harsher criticism of the US president’s aggression than any of his fellow European leaders.This week, Sánchez did not wait for a joint EU statement to issue judgment on the US’s illegal military intervention to capture the Venezuelan president, Nicolás Maduro: he swiftlyjoined Latin American countriesin condemning it. A few hours later he went even further,saying the operationin Caracas represented “a terrible precedent and a very dangerous one [which] reminds us of past aggressions, and pushes the world toward a future of uncertainty and insecurity, similar to what we already experienced after other invasions driven by the thirst for oil”.Sanchez was speaking in Paris on Tuesday after a meeting of the “coalition of the willing” for Ukraine. Indeed, he made the case that on Venezuela, Ukraine and Gaza he was applying the same reasoning in defence of an international order “based on the observance of fair rules, not on the law of the jungle”.He also pushed back against US sabre-rattling over Greenland: “Spain, believing in peace, diplomacy and the United Nations, cannot, of course, accept this, just as we cannot accept the explicit threat to the territorial integrity of a European state, as is the case with Denmark.”If Sánchez is sounding more outraged than other European leaders, even progressive ones, then one reason is the influence of Spain’s far-left parties, including Sumar, the junior party in his governing coalition. But he is also drawing on broad social and even political consensus inSpainon many of these international issues.Sánchez’s messaging on foreign policy is popular in Spain, a country where confidence in Trump is among thelowest in the worldand where there is widespread support, in particular, for the rights ofPalestiniansandUkrainians. Even before this latest crisis, Venezuela was part of the national debate in Spain.About 600,000 Venezuelanslive in Spain, and Spanishpoliticians attack each otherover their past positionsand connections to the country. In Madrid,home to more than 200,000 Venezuelans, conversations about Caracas are commonplace everywhere, from classrooms to coffee queues.Politicians of Venezuela’s opposition, including its leader, Edmundo González, now live as refugees in Spain. There is a broad agreement across the Spanish political class about condemning the Maduro regime, but also questioning the legitimacy of US actions, even among the leadership of the conservative Popular party (PP).Some hawkish PP voices, particularly the regional president of Madrid, Isabel Díaz Ayuso, ofteninvoke “Chavismo”to attack Sánchez’s government, suggesting it has connections with the Venezuelan regime, even though it refused to recognise Maduro as the legitimate president after the 2024 election and officials have describedVenezuela as a dictatorship. It is Díaz Ayuso, however, who stands out in Spain for remaining less critical of Trump. Even thePP-founded thinktank FAES, led by the former conservative prime minister José María Aznar, criticised US “colonialism” and its marginalisation of the Venezuelan opposition figure María Corina Machado.Will Sanchez’s condemnation jeopardise Spain’s relationship with the US – the fear motivating other European leaders to keep silent – or indeed have any impact on Trump? So far, it seems barely to have registered with the White House, but Trump has previously suggested that Spain should beexpelled from Natoafter it resisted his demands for increasing military spending. In October, Trumphintedat punishment with extra tariffsmentioningthat the Spanish economy was doing “very well, and that economy could be blown right out of the water with something bad happening”. No such punishment has yet materialised.Yet, as with its handling of Gaza and Ukraine, the Spanish government is often better at words and gestures than meaningful actions, and too often tends to think about international crises in terms of domestic political gain.Madrid has offered to mediate in the crisis in Venezuela, partly with the interests of big Spanish companies in mind, particularly the oil company Repsol and the telecommunications conglomerate Telefónica.Five Spanish prisonerswere among a group of political detainees released in from jail in Caracas on Thursday, a move welcomed by Sánchez as an “act of justice”.This year is likely to be a difficult one for Sánchez’s Socialist party, with polls forecasting setbacks in upcoming regional elections. The prime minister’s popularity has been eroded bycorruption scandalsinvolving close allies and a series ofsexual harassment allegationsabout officials in his party.For Sánchez, talking about difficult global issues may offer useful respite from his mounting domestic challenges. And his consistently smooth and outspoken manner does not just go down well in the global south – most Spaniards agree with him on the fundamentals of Trump, Ukraine and Gaza. Sánchez’s criticism of Trump may be less risky than it first appears – but he is still being bold in articulating what many other European leaders think, but dare not say.María Ramírez is a journalist and deputy managing editor of elDiario.es, a news outlet in SpainExplore more on these topicsPedro SánchezOpinionSpainEuropean UnionVenezuelaAmericasEuropeNicolás MadurocommentShareReuse this content"

And our critic thinks he has just worked it outJonathan JonesFri 9 Jan 2026 10.43 ESTLast modified on Fri 9 Jan 2026 10.50 ESTShareIncreased security after the recent heist has made the queues at the Louvre even slower, yet on this rainswept, very wintry morning, no one grumbles. After all, the Mona Lisa is waiting inside for all these tourists who have come from the world over. Leonardo da Vinci’s woman – swathed in dark cloth and silk, smiling enigmatically as she sits in front of a landscape of rocks, road and water – draws crowds like no other painting. But if the Mona Lisa can attract such attention fully clothed, what would the queues be like if she was nude?Strangely, this is not just amusing speculation – because in 18th-century Britain, she was. An engraving issued by a publisher called John Boydell gave libertine Georgians the opportunity to hang “Joconda” in their boudoir. It must have been popular because many copies survive. This Mona Lisa sits in a chair with her hands crossed in front of a fading view of distant rock formations. And, like the Mona Lisa in the Louvre, she smiles enigmatically. But there is one key difference.She is naked from the waist up.Horace Walpole thought his father Robert, who was Britain's first Prime Minister, had the actual Mona LisaThe print has a caption saying this is a reproduction of the painting by “Lionardo da Vinci” that hangs “in the Gallery at Houghton”. Today, Houghton Hall in Norfolk stages contemporary art on its lawns, but back then it was famous for the oil paintings amassed by its owner, Britain’s first and most corrupt Prime Minister, Sir Robert Walpole. The Houghton collection was catalogued by his son Horace, then 26, who apparently thought his father’s “Joconda”, on which this engraving was based, was the actual Mona Lisa: “The Joconda, a Smith’s Wife, reckon’d the handsomest Woman of her Time: She was Mistress to Francis I, King of France; by Lionardo da Vinci. She would often sit half naked, with Musick, for several Hours together, to be drawn by him.”This image of the king of France’s lover posing for hours “half naked” while musicians played is an interesting twist on the first account we have of the Mona Lisa, published in 1550 by the Florentine architect and artist Giorgio Vasari. To elicit that smile, Vasari says, Leonardo “always employed, while he was painting her portrait, persons to play or sing, and jesters, who might make her merry”. Posing only half dressed, she would need plenty of distractions.View image in fullscreenGlobal pulling power … visitors viewing the Mona Lisa in the Louvre.Photograph: Manish Swarup/APYou won’t find the nude Joconda at Houghton today. In 1779, Walpole’s art collection was sold to Catherine the Great and today it hangs at the Hermitage in St Petersburg, the nude Mona Lisa no longer attributed to Leonardo butto one of his unnamed 16th-century followers. Yet, if the work is by a Leonardo imitator, was there a nude Mona Lisa by him to imitate? And if there was, why did Leonardo paint it and for whom? It is one of the most tantalising, and entertaining, mysteries in art – and I think I may have solved it.First, we need to go to the Loire, where Leonardo spent his final years as French royal artist. It was here that the artist himself left a fascinating clue. In October 1517, he had visitors to his chateau: Cardinal Luigi of Aragon and his cleric Antonio de Beatis. Leonardo – “the most outstanding painter of our day”, records De Beatis – showed them three paintings, all hanging today in the Louvre. Two were religious: John the Baptist and The Virgin and Child With St Anne. The other was “a certain Florentine woman portrayed from life at the request of the late Magnificent Giuliano de’ Medici”.It is generally accepted that they were being shown the Louvre Mona Lisa. But they don’t seem to have been told the truth by Leonardo: this Mona Lisa was not painted for Giuliano de’ Medici (and despite Horace Walpole’s imaginings, certainly not for the king of France).Leonardo added so many touches to the Mona Lisa that she had become in his mind someone else, his dreamA document in Heidelberg University proves this painting was begun in Florence in 1503, some 14 years before these chateau visitors saw it. It was a portrait of Lisa del Giocondo, wife of merchant Francesco del Giocondo, just as Vasari wrote (hence its various alternative names, La Gioconda/Gioconde/Joconde/Joconda). Mona is short for Monna, the polite way to address a married woman in Renaissance Florence. Lisa, being middle class, would be addressed as Mona Lisa.So why did Leonardo mention Giuliano de’ Medici, the youngest son of Lorenzo the Magnificent, de facto ruler of the Florentine Republic? He certainly did not paint the clothed Mona Lisa for Giuliano – but maybe Leonardo was telling a truth of sorts. Perhaps he painted the naked version for the nobleman.On 24 September 1513, Leonardo left Milan, then his base, for Rome, bound for the Belvedere in the papal palace where he was given a studio by Giuliano de’ Medici, whose older brother had just become pope. It was a chance for Leonardo to live in style and paint in the city where Michelangelo and Raphael were at work.The pope didn’t trust him with frescoes, but Leonardo may have done something more intimate for Giuliano. In a chateau in Chantilly, just north of Paris, there is a mysterious “cartoon” – the term given to a full-scale preparatory drawing that would have chalk pushed through it to mark a canvas. This cartoon, dated 1514-16, portraysthe same nude model featured in the Houghton paintingand has unmistakable allusions to the Mona Lisa. After technical analysis, the Louvre announced in 2017 that there was strong evidence that it was at least partly by Leonardo, done with the left hand.The claim becomes all the more convincing if you look hard, particularly at the drapery that has his free and infinite suggestiveness. The woman, whose upper body is naked, sits in a wooden chair with her left forearm horizontal, turned side-on to the viewer just like the Louvre’s Mona Lisa. Similarly, she has also placed her right hand over her left wrist. Even the spread and shading of her fingers is identical. The Mona Lisa’s hands may not be central to her fame today, but in Renaissance Italy their elegant positioning was widely imitated.View image in fullscreenUnmistakable allusions … the nude Mona Lisa ‘cartoon’ at the Domaine de Chantilly, with her elegantly positioned hands.Photograph: Michel Urtado/AFP/Getty ImagesThe artist who drew the Chantilly nude doesn’t just emulate all that, but replicates itperfectly. This would be easy – if you had access to Leonardo’s studio, or if you actually were Leonardo. And the Mona Lisa was with him in Rome, just as it would be in France. He never gave it to Lisa’s husband. Its size – just 77cm by 53cm – made it easy to transport on his restless sojourns. One reason why he may have no longer have thought of this as a portrait of Mona Lisa, when he talked to his Loire visitors, is because it no longer was: he’d added so many touches over the years, transfiguring the original, that she’d become in his mind someone else, his dream.So the creator of the Houghton painting must have worked from the Chantilly sketch, or from a nude painting based on it. In other words, it seems highly probable that Leonardo, perhaps helped by his pupils, painted this nude Mona Lisa.But is there any more evidence? I believe I’ve found a crucial clue hanging in plain sight in the Barberini Palace in Rome: a “half-naked” portrait by Leonardo’s young admirer Raphael. The Rome in which Leonardo was living was lavishly hedonist, with handsome Raphael its star. Raphael and his team were creating a sensual heated bathroom for the papal palace, adorning it with frescoes. Raphael also decorated the party palace of the pope’s banker Agostino Chigi. Vasari claims that when Raphael was frescoing there, he required his mistress to live with him. His early death was supposedly caused by sexual exhaustion.Around 1520, Raphael portrayeda young woman sitting in a garden with her top off. She smiles sideways as she holds a translucent piece of silk over her belly. Her breasts and arms are bare, except for a blue armband that says in gold letters: “Raphael of Urbino.” The painting is known as La Fornarina, The Baker’s Daughter, after a legend that Raphael’s girlfriend’s dad was a baker.When I was investigating the decadent delights of high Renaissance Rome recently, I realised with a shock that this work is basically a nude Mona Lisa. That little smile echoes Leonardo’s masterpiece. She sits calmly, her eyes and nose as clearly defined as Leonardo’s model, sporting transparent silk like the veil that covers the Mona Lisa’s head. Francesco del Giocondo was a silk merchant and that may be why Leonardo draped her in the material, while also being enchanted by the optical possibilities. Both these “half naked” women, in Horace Walpole’s words, sit with their clothes around them, thrown off.The nude Mona Lisa was a grenade chucked into the Renaissance – it radicalised the way artists painted bodiesThe similarities are just too close for coincidence. Raphael is an impeccable artist but not as wildly original as Leonardo. Instead, he learned from his elder, imitating the Mona Lisa ever since he saw it in an early state in Florence around 1504. This gregarious, courtly artist would have visited Leonardo at the Belvedere and seen his latest stunning idea, the nude Mona Lisa. Did Leonardo paint it as well as sketch it? The painting owned by Robert Walpole is clearly based on the Chantilly drawing but adds a rocky blue landscape, one that’s typical of late Leonardo works. The rock formations have the same pale blue shade as the mountains in The Virgin and Child With St Anne.The nude Mona Lisa was like a grenade chucked into the high Renaissance. It instantly radicalised the way artists painted bodies. The otherwise conservative Raphael’s bold Fornarina spread this revolution. The model who posed for La Fornarina also posed naked for Raphael’s chief assistant, Giulio Romano, whose art mixes classicism with what it’s fair to call pornography: he created a visual sex guide called I Modi (“The Ways”) that illustrates 16 love-making positions. Titian and Correggio took up the challenge to paint sensual nudes.View image in fullscreen‘The similarities are just too close for coincidence’ … Raphael’s La Fornarina, or The Baker’s Daughter.Photograph: Marco Di Lauro/Associated PressA number of paintings by Leonardo are lost, especially those that scandalised the devout. They include his erotic Leda and the Swan, believed to have been destroyed by a shocked French royal. This painting of a woman and her swan lover was created by Leonardo in early 16th-century Florence not long after he started the Mona Lisa. Surviving drawings and copies suggest it was outrageous and titillating: one, in Chatsworth House, Derbyshire, portrays the swan putting a wing around the voluptuous Leda as it whispers into, or stimulates, her ear.If Leonardo was creating such sublime eroticism as he worked on the Mona Lisa around 1504, it’s no great leap to believe he created a nude version as well. In his notebooks, he boasts that while a poet can only describe a patron’s lover, the painter can bring her to life – and “the lovestruck judge” will prefer the picture every time. He even relates gleefully how a man once returned a painting he did of the Virgin Mary because it filled him with the wrong thoughts.The Mona Lisa was 'iconic' the moment it was first seen – artists saw it as unequalledGiuliano de’ Medici, Leonardo’s patron, got married in early 1515. My hypothesis is that, as a memento, Leonardo portrayed naked a mistress whom Giuliano would be forced to give up, sitting her in the exact pose of the Mona Lisa. For the painter, as Leonardo insisted, “can place before the lover a true likeness of the beloved, often making him kiss and speak to it”.If Leonardo actually created a nude Mona Lisa, that tells us something extraordinary about the world’s most famous painting and its creator. The artist, it seems, was able to joke about what we now call the “iconic” nature of his work. It is sometimes assumed the fame of the Mona Lisa is a modern cultural phenomenon, sparked by an early 20th-century heist, Duchamp and Warhol’s versions and mass reproduction. That’s not true. It was iconic the moment it was first seen: artists saw it as unequalled.Leonardo was so confident of that uniqueness he felt able to travesty it with a naked version. He was cleverer than us. While he can’t have know that, in the 21st century, people would queue in the rain to see his masterpiece, he did know it was the ultimate painting. Leonardo’s Mona Lisa is a vision of artistic perfection, clothed or naked.Explore more on these topicsMona LisaLeonardo da VinciArtPaintingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Now the director of Oldboy is back with a blistering satire about a man driven to murder after redundancyFri 9 Jan 2026 03.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 9 Jan 2026 05.14 ESTShareThe Korean wave is being feted around the world right now but Park Chan-wook is not feeling too celebratory. From the outside, South Korea seems to be a well-oiled machine pumping out a stream of world-conquering pop music, cuisine, cars, cinema (especially the Oscar-winningParasite) and TV shows, as well as the Samsung flat-screens to watch them on. But Park’s latest film,No Other Choice, bursts the balloon somewhat. It paints modern-day Korea as an unstable landscape of industrial decline, downsizing, unemployment and male fragility – with no KPop Demon Hunters coming to save the day.“I did not mean it for it to be a realistic portrayal of Korea in 2025,” says Park, a serene, almost professorial 62-year-old. “I think it’s more accurate to view it as a satire on capitalism.”AI is so powerful that you can’t even compete with it any moreNo Other Choice’s setting is the comically mundane but almost literally cut-throat world of paper manufacturing, where a freshly fired executive hatches a deranged scheme to get ahead by murdering his rivals for a new position, of which he does a pretty bad job. But it could just as well be about the entertainment industry, which is also more precarious than it looks, Park suggests: “Even though Korean films and shows are so globally trendy, Korean audiences have not been returning to the theatre after the pandemic, and there’s also talk around how the TV industry is being threatened. And this decline happened immediately after the success of Squid Game and Parasite. I think that gap in itself is very ironic.”Irony is very much the mode with Park’s cinema. No Other Choice begins with salaryman Man-su (played by Lee Byung-hun) congratulating himself for having it all: a good job, beautiful house, loving wife, two children and two dogs. He welcomes the onset of fall, not realising it augurs his own fall: within days he is on his knees begging for work, having been made redundant by his new American bosses, which leads him to his deranged murder plan. It sounds bleak but it’s leavened by heavy doses of black comedy, mordant slapstick and clumsy violence, including a hare-brained plot to eliminate one of his competitors by getting obliteratingly drunk with him – via the very Korean technique ofpoktanju: a shot glass of whisky sunk into a pint of beer. Park was no stranger to this cocktail in the past, he admits, “but I don’t drink it any more. I realised that I shouldn’t be doing that to myself.”View image in fullscreenNo Other Choice.Photograph: Everett/ShutterstockEven No Other Choice’s title is ironic: Man-su clearlydoeshave other choices. He could go after his employers rather than his peers. Or he could simply put up with being poorer – but he’ll do anything to avoid losing his house and his status, especially within the family. “The audience desperately wants to cheer him on and for him to find a job, but at other times, they realise that his choices are wrong,” says Park. “Those two feelings coexist, and the audience switches between them. That was the goal behind the making of this film.”The greater irony here is that Park is practically the poster boy for Korean cultural clout. He has been on the crest of the Korean wave for the past 20 years, and alongside his compatriot, Parasite director Bong Joon-ho, he has broken down barriers for the country’s cinema. As with Bong, Park’s movies have combined festival acclaim with commercial appeal, not least hisbreakthrough Oldboy, which won the Grand Prix at Cannes in 2004 and introduced the world to a new brand of vivid, gruesome, twisted but technically accomplished cinema – epitomised by the scenes where Oldboy’s protagonist dispatches multiple assailants in a one-take corridor battle, armed only with a hammer, and another where he eats a live octopus. In the UK, Park’s films were marketed under a DVD label called “Asia Extreme”, alongside works by compatriots such as Kim Jee-woon and Kim Ki-duk and certain Japanese directors.Looking back, Park is uneasy: “I felt like I was getting boxed in because of that brand. It created an unnecessary form of prejudice.” He’s relieved that the label no longer applies, partly because his “extreme” aesthetic has infused mainstream cinema, but also because Park moved on with apparent ease to Hollywood and slightly less violent English-language projects. These included his 2018 John le Carré miniseriesThe Little Drummer Girl, starring Florence Pugh and Alexander Skarsgård, and 2024’s underratedThe Sympathizer, about Viet-Cong spies in 70s America, featuring Robert Downey Jr in multiple roles.“It’s not like I’m making intentional choices to mellow down my violence to avoid that sort of a reputation,” he says. “I don’t know what kind of films I’ll be making in the future, but they could be equally as graphic as my previous ones.”View image in fullscreenPark Chan-wook and Nicole Kidman on the set of Stoker.Photograph: PictureLux/The Hollywood Archive/AlamyDirecting in English wasn’t as easy as it looked, he adds, especially on his first Hollywood feature, 2013’s Stoker, a Hitchcockian thriller starring Nicole Kidman and Matthew Goode. “I was scared at first, especially in regards to having conversations through an interpreter,” he says. He was helped by his actors. “It actually wasn’t that different, maybe because Nicole tried her best to adjust to me.” Kidman prefers to do her own preparation, he explains, whereas he prefers to sit down with the whole cast and work through the script line by line. “I suggested to her: why don’t we just try it out? And ultimately, she said it was very helpful.”He is not fluent in English and is speaking through an interpreter today, but “my English is good enough where if I sense that something is not being translated correctly, I can point that out,” he says. “Another issue that could arise is misunderstanding from linguistic or cultural differences, but I’ve actually tried to use that to my advantage, because I could offer a perspective on British or American societies that people within the society might fail to see.”Now, like Bong, he mixes it up: some projects in English, some in Korean, others a hybrid of the two. His sumptuous lesbian thrillerThe Handmaidentransposed Sarah Waters’ novel Fingersmith from Victorian England to early 20th-century Korea. Similarly, No Other Choice is adapted from The Ax, a novel by American crime writer Donald Westlake, but set in Ulsan, a coastal city in south-east Korea. Park has been trying to adapt the story since he first read it in about 2005, he explains – around the same time as a French-language adaptation of the same story was released. “Initially, this was intended as an American film in English, but lots of fruitless years have passed, and it eventually changed into a Korean film.”View image in fullscreenKim Min-hee and Kim Tae-ri in The Handmaiden.Photograph: Amazon Studios/AllstarThe delay at least gave him the chance to cast Lee, who first worked with Park on his 2001 hit Joint Security Area, and more recently starred in Squid Game and voiced the chief demon in KPop Demon Hunters. Park describes him as “the Jack Lemmon of Korea” – handsome but expressive and versatile, a relatable everyman. “Before, he would have been too young for the role, but because a lot of time has passed, he had reached just the right age.”Despite the story’s age, the themes of economic and masculine insecurity – and the victims of neoliberal capitalism turning on each other rather than the real villains – still resonate, especially in Korea. But Park has given it a very 21st-century update: the spectre of artificial intelligence looms large in this new industrial landscape, adding another level of irony to the tale. “While the original novel portrayed competition between humans, I added AI, which is so powerful that you can’t even compete with it any more,” he says.Again, these anxieties are not limited to paper manufacturing – even if it can be seen as a metaphor for the dying age of analogue. Park is well aware that AI is coming for his own profession, too. “It doesn’t look as threatening right now, but considering the speed of its development in the past year, I’m very concerned for how many people in our film industry will have their jobs replaced by AI.” He’s worried for colleagues, he says, “but I’m also worried for a situation in which I have no choice but to embrace AI – for instance, if studios decide to cut budgets with AI.”No Other Choice review – sensational state-of-the-nation satire from Park Chan-wookRead moreEither way, he’s unlikely to be bumping off his rivals, No Other Choice-style. Especially not Bong Joon-ho: the two of them are old friends. Park gave Bong his first job, in fact. “I asked him to work on a script for me, and we had discussions, but it never ended up happening.” The two have used the same actors, including Parasite star Song Kang-ho, and Park co-produced Bong’s 2013sci-fi movie Snowpiercer. “Our wives are very close as well, so we meet up very often. AndSong Kang-ho– his family is also very close with our families. So we often hang out together,” he says. “When I wrote the first draft for No Other Choice, I shared the script with [Bong] and asked for his feedback.”Perhaps that’s part of the reason Korea’s screen culture has been so successful recently. Not only are they not at each other’s throats, their work often views economic success and the capitalist model with scepticism, if not downright pessimism. There’s no Korean equivalent of the American Dream, it seems. You could say No Other Choice tackles head-on the same ironies and inequalities as Bong’s Parasite, or his recent sci-fi comedyMickey 17– where a cloned Robert Pattinson plays the ultimate expendable worker. Or even Hwang Dong-hyuk’s Squid Game, with its life-or-death, winner-takes-all gameshow setup, which wasinspired by Hwang’s own experiencesof economic hardship after the 2008 financial crash. Perhaps Korean cinema is offering perspectives that we westerners are failing to see.Not that Park has any stated agenda, philosophically, thematically or even geographically. As if to prove the point, he says his next two projects are both US-backed, but one is a sci-fi (adapted from the Japanese manga Genocidal Organ), the other a western (Brigands of Rattlecreek – it sounds very violent).“If I got a proposal for a good story that takes place in France or in a country in Africa, I would go there,” he says. “I just follow good stories.”No Other Choice will be in UK cinemas on 23 January.Explore more on these topicsFilmSouth KoreafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Charting the couple’s anguish over the death of their 11-year-old son – said to have inspired the play Hamlet – it has moved audiences to tears and united critics in their praise.The film’s emotional force is carried by the Irish actor and singer Jessie Buckley, who portrays Hathaway (opposite Paul Mescal’s Shakespeare) with a rawness and intimacy that has already earned her a Critics’ Circle award for best actress, and marked her out as a leading contender for the Golden Globes, Baftas and Oscars. The Guardian film critic Peter Bradshawcalled her “unselfconsciously beguiling”, whileRolling Stone predictedaudiences “will be talking about Jessie Buckley’s performance for years”.Hamnet review – Paul Mescal and Jessie Buckley beguile and captivate in audacious Shakespearean tragedyRead more“[Agnes] was the full story of what I understand a woman to be,” Buckley, 36,said recently. “And their capacity as women, and as mothers, and as lovers, and as people who have a language unto their own beside gigantic men of literature like Shakespeare.”That sense of Agnes as an uncontainable being finds its most devastating expression in one of the film’s key scenes. When Agnes realises Hamnet has died in her arms, Buckley releases a scream so unfiltered it cuts through the film’s careful quiet. Zhao has described the moment as coming from “beyond past, present and future”.Buckley’s ability to inhabit an extremity of emotions has been honed over years – on stage and screen. Born in Killarney, County Kerry, the eldest of five siblings, she attended an all-girls convent school before studying at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (Rada) in London.View image in fullscreenJessie Buckley, centre, as Agnes in Hamnet.Photograph: 2025 Focus Features/PAHer career began in 2008 as a contestant on the BBC talent show I’d Do Anything, where she competed to play Nancy in a West End adaptation of Oliver! (she finished second behind Jodie Prenger, and recentlycalled the experience “brutalising”).After graduating from Rada in 2013, Buckley’s stage career took off, including landing starring roles in The Tempest at Shakespeare’s Globe and opposite Jude Law in a West End production of Henry V. Her early onscreen appearances were in BBC television series such as War & Peace, Taboo, and The Woman in White.One awards battle after another: A-listers face off at this year’s Golden GlobesRead moreHer film debut came in the psychological thriller Beast, playing the lead role of Moll, a troubled young woman who falls for a poacher suspected of murders. The film’s director, Michael Pearce, told the Guardian Buckley gave “every ounce of herself” to the role. “Because of that commitment you end up with so many incredible surprises in the performance.“My initial version of Moll was slightly colder and more restrained, and Jessie instinctively pushed the character somewhere far more alive, like she was a raw nerve who felt everything intensely and was constantly trying to keep that intensity under control.” Pearce’s editor was also moved by her. “The first thing she said was: ‘Where did you find this incredible actor? She’s so emotionally alive on screen.’”View image in fullscreenBuckley starred alongside Johnny Flynn in the psychological thriller Beast.Photograph: Album/AlamyBuckley’s career progressed with starring roles in the TV series Chernobyl and Fargo, and in films including Wild Rose, The Courier and I’m Thinking of Ending Things. She starred as a younger version of Olivia Colman’s character in Maggie Gyllenhaal’s feature directorial debut The Lost Daughter in 2021, a critically acclaimed performance for which she received her first Oscar nomination. Buckley then led Alex Garland’s folk horror film Men the following year, playing a widow who travels to a village and becomes tormented by strange men, all played by Rory Kinnear. Kinnear told the Guardian “everyone that’s worked with [Jessie] knows she will go down as one of the best to ever do it”.Buckley’s other recent films include an adaptation of Women Talking (2022) and Wicked Little Letters (2023). Meanwhile, on stage, her portrayal of Sally Bowles in a 2021 West End revival of Cabaret won her the Olivier award for best actress in a musical. The following year, she released the album For All Our Days That Tear the Heart with the former Suede guitarist Bernard Butler, which was shortlisted for the Mercury prize.View image in fullscreenBuckley and Olivia Colman before the release of Wicked Little Letters. The pair also co-starred in The Lost Daughter.Photograph: Alecsandra Raluca Drăgoi/The GuardianThe Cabaret director, Rebecca Frecknall, recalled the first time they rehearsed the scene that led up to the show’s title number. “Everyone in the room gradually stopped what they were doing and focused on her. I don’t know what she was channelling in that moment but it was one of the most exciting moments I’ve ever experienced in a rehearsal room.” Fracknall said Buckley was “so live all of the time, like she has one less layer of skin than anyone else”.Timothée Chalamet and Jessie Buckley in Oscar surge as they win Critics Choice awardsRead moreBen Whishaw, who starred alongside Buckley in Fargo and Women Talking, said watching her work on set was fascinating. “It was like observing an animal in its natural habitat: obeying some natural instinct she barely understood, very beautiful, but also, if something got in her way, she may bite,” he said.“There are days when it seems Jessie has written a song, recorded an album, cooked lunch for 12 people and had a baby all before I’ve managed to get out of bed.“Her performance in Hamnet is now among my favourites of all time – up there with Gena Rowlands, Maria Falconetti and Anna Magnani – people we both love and revere.”Buckley and her husband, a mental health worker, live in Norfolk and had their first child last year, after playing Agnesgave her a “deep need”to become a mother.She is up against a slate of acclaimed performers this awards season, including Chase Infiniti (One Battle After Another) and Renate Reinsve (Sentimental Value). Whether she triumphs or not,Buckley has said her intentionis “to make people feel rather than becoming disembodied, disconnected, disengaged”.Explore more on these topicsFilmJessie BuckleyCelebrityOscarsAwards and prizesnewsShareReuse this content"

How everyone might be related on The TraitorsFrom the family tree to intriguing cutaway shots – and the early reveals of secret relationships – a fan theory is gaining traction. Is it possible that all the contestants entered in pairs?Michael HoganFri 9 Jan 2026 10.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 9 Jan 2026 10.03 ESTShareIt’s a tangled web of intrigue in those castle corridors. Two hidden relationships have already come to light in the current run ofThe Traitors. The unjustly banished Judy was revealed to be the mother of Faithful Roxy, before psychologist Ellie confessed that Ross, who’d just been sent packing himself, was her boyfriend.An increasingly popular fan theory suggests that these covert connections are merely the tip of the treacherous iceberg. Sofa sleuths claim the framed family tree on display in theArdross Castlelobby – the one the Traitors covertly daubed with red fingerprints to mark candidates for murder – is a hint that everyone in this year’s game has a pre-existing tie to somebody else.The Latin inscription on the picture translates as: “Beware whom you trust as your own blood. The sharpest knives are often handed over the table by trusted servants. Among close friends lurk the most hidden enemies. Beware lest your trust become the cause of your ruin and destruction.”Sounds significant, right? If family trees are indeed the secret theme of the civilian series, the entire castle cohort could have been cast in pairs and be slyly working together in teams of two. There have also been recurring cutaway shots to a 1934 copy of Who’s Who? in the castle library, which feels like a clanging biographical clue.We haven’t yet reached the devilish contest’s midway mark, so can expect plenty more plot twists to come. Here are 10 potential options for more hush-hush romances and familial links…Reece’s mum is in the castleView image in fullscreenMumsy … Fiona.Photograph: Euan Cherry/BBC/Studio Lambert/PAReece from Sheffield – whose wholesome job title is sweet shop assistant, like something out of the Beano – has been the subject of multiple theories (not to mention multiple murder near-misses). He “worships” Fiona “like a mum”. Could that be because sheishis mother? The chaotic Secret Traitor hails from Swansea and the name “Reece” has Welsh roots, as an anglicised form of Rhys. It might also explain why Fiona was in no rush to free him from his cage during the hidden skulls mission. As a Traitor, she knew he’d be safe.Other viewers have pointed to Reece’s close bond with retired police detective Amanda. The pair keep playing snooker and having cosy conflabs, hinting that she might be his mother. Reece is 27, Amanda is 57 and Fiona is 62. The maths works in either case.There’s even a wild card theory that Reece is related to Rachel – which would explain why he didn’t mention the fact that she asked him to leave her and Stephen alone at the family tree on the crucial night in question. Of the screen grabs from the series on his Instagram account, several feature Reece with Rachel. Coincidence? Probably, yes, but worth a chin stroke.Jessie is dating JackView image in fullscreen‘Love you’ … Jessie and Jack.Photograph: Euan Cherry/BBC/Studio LambertOrange-haired Jessie from Hull is emerging as this year’s “Jazatha Christie”, with her sleuthing sights trained firmly on Stephen the sharp-dressed Traitor. There’s also mounting speculation about her being in a hidden romance with Essex personal trainer Jack – who, at 29, is just one year her senior.For this week’s cage mission, Jessie chose to fight on behalf of Jack. As they held hands through the bars of his cage, she whispered “Love you!”. Quite familiar for somebody you only met four days ago. When she successfully released him, Jessie leapt into Jack’s arms with a squeal of delight. “I couldn’t have been more proud of her,” he said. Aye-aye.Faraaz is Maz’s son or grandsonThis year’s youngest contestant, 22-year-old internal auditor Faraaz, seemed especially affected by last night’s face-to-face murder of police officer-turned-civil servant Maz. Both are unassuming blokes with a gentle manner. Both are practising Muslims from the north - Middlesbrough and Preston respectively.Maz is an avowed family man with five children and five grandchildren. Could one of those be his fellow Faithful? Social media sleuths claim to have spotted similarities in their facial profiles and physical mannerisms. Hey, their names even rhyme.Rachel and Matt are siblingsView image in fullscreenBrotherly love? … Rachel and Matt.Photograph: Euan Cherry/BBC/Studio Lambert/PAA tad tenuous, admittedly, but some fans have speculated that Rachel and Matthew might be brother and sister. They’re both Northern Irish and have rarely been shown in conversation, suggesting they could be deliberately avoiding one another – or the edit is concealing their connection *bangs gavel*.Matt and Stephen are engagedAnother suggestion is that Matt and Stephen are secretly in a relationship. This might be wishful thinking because they’re the only two out gay men in the contest, but the thirtysomethings do share a Scottish link – Matt is based in Edinburgh, while Stephen originally hails from the Isle of Lewis.Matthew mentioned early in the series that he’d use the prize money for “a big gay wedding” with his partner. Eagle-eyed viewers have spotted that Stephen wears what could be an engagement ring. It’s a long shot but it might just work. However, Instagram posts suggest that both have partners who aren’t in the game. At least they have nice knitwear in common.Maz and Amanda are former police colleaguesView image in fullscreenBuddying up … Amanda and Maz on The Traitors: Uncloaked.Photograph: James Green/BBC/Listen EntertainmentThey fell in quick succession this week, but before he was murdered face-to-face, “civil servant” Maz revealed that he was a retired police officer. He wasn’t the only one in the castle, of course. The formidable Amanda is an ex-Met detective.What are the chances of having two former coppers out of 22 contestants? It led some viewers to wonder if the pair used to work together. Bang to rights or fuzz fantasy?Hugo is Jade’s father or Amanda’s brotherThe “psychopathic teddy bear” was the first Traitor to fall – but before he bowed out, barrister Hugo robustly defended Jade at the round table. Was it paternal protectiveness? They’re both pretty posh. He’s 51 and PhD student Jade is 26, leading some viewers to wonder if he’s her father.Others clocked an exchange which hinted that Hugo knew about Amanda’s undisclosed police past. “You’re the only one who’s prosecuted people,” he told her. It could have been a coincidental turn of phrase, but perhaps it pointed to the pair having worked together with the CPS.With six years between them, they might even be siblings. This might explain why Amanda scoffed at suggestions they were in a relationship (“I’m a lesbian,” she said, while Hugo agreed, “I’m not your type”) – and why he paid tribute to her “playing a better game than me” before his banishment.Harriet is related to one of the ladsView image in fullscreenMother of one? … Harriet (right), with Amanda and Maz.Photograph: Euan Cherry/BBC/Studio LambertObservant viewers pounced on crime novelist Harriet Tyce’s remark when Reece was overcome by emotion. “I’ve never seen you cry like that before,” she said, then swiftly corrected herself. Some saw it as a slip-up, indicating that Reece could be her son or nephew.There’s been similar guesswork about Harriet, 52, having a familial link to one of the castle’s other youngish blokes: gardener James, builder Adam, creative director Matthew or account manager Sam. Has lightning struck Tyce?Adam and Jack are brothersWhen Adam received a vote at episode two’s round table, the camera cut straight to Jack for his reaction. They’re both Essex boys. What more do you need? Entire internet conspiracies have been built on less.Somebody has an identical twinBear with us here. One niche theory doing the rounds is that there are identical twins cast in the series and the producers are secretly switching them in and out. How would this work? To what end? And who could it be? Your guess is as good as ours, but it would be a plot twist to make the resident owl’s head spin.Explore more on these topicsThe TraitorsTelevisionClaudia WinklemanfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The longlists, which are an intermediate stage on the way to the final nominations with each category determined by different mixes of membership voting and jury selection, suggest that some progress is being made.In the directors list, which Bafta mandated must include 50% women, the longlist has found room for Chloé Zhao(Hamnet), Katherine Bigelow (A House of Dynamite), Lynne Ramsay (Die My Love), Hikari (Rental Family) and Kaouther Ben Hania (The Voice of Hind Rajab). Including Ryan Coogler (Sinners), the list contains four people of colour; Bafta however, does not appear to have targets for this. Juke-joint horror Sinners has performed strongly overall, in joint second place having secured 14 longlist entries.The acting longlists appear, however, to be performing less well in terms of diversity, with seven people of colour out of 40 longlistees included. Places have been found for Cynthia Erivo (Wicked: For Good), who was excluded fromthe Actors (formerly Screen Actors Guild) awards nominees, alongside Chase Infiniti (One Battle After Another) and Tessa Thompson (Hedda) in the best actress list, while Sinners’ Michael B Jordan, Wunmi Mosaku and Delroy Lindo, and Teyana Taylor (One Battle After Another) are included elsewhere.In 2025 Bafta said it had achieved its five-year targetof 20% of members from minority ethnic groups, 12% deaf, disabled and neurodivergent people and 10% LGB+. However it had not achieved its target of 50% female membership, saying 43% identified as women.In total longlist entries for the 2026 awards, Paul Thomas Anderson’s One Battle After Another is currently best placed; starring Leonardo DiCaprio in a loose adaptation of Thomas Pynchon’s novel Vineland; it appears 16 times, in contention for awards including best picture, best director for Anderson, and best actor and actress for DiCaprio and Infiniti.Also well represented on the longlist are Shakespearean grief drama Hamnet andSinners, which have each secured 14 entries. Hamnet, directed by Zhao and starring Paul Mescal and Jessie Buckley, is included on the list for best picture, outstanding British film, best director for Zhao and best actor and actress for Mescal and Buckley. Sinners, likewise, is on the list for best picture, best director for Coogler, and best actor for Michael B Jordan.Other strong performers include Marty Supreme (13 entries, including Timothée Chalamet for best actor), and Bugonia and Frankenstein on 12 each. The longlist would appear to confirm Wicked: For Good’s faltering awards season momentum; despite its commercial success, the film is well down the field with only eight, though these do include Erivo and Ariana Grande for best actress and supporting actress respectively.The final nominations are announced on 27 January, and the award winners will be announced on 22 February ata ceremony at London’s Royal Festival Hall hosted by actor Alan Cumming.Explore more on these topicsFilmBaftasRaceSinnersWomenAwards and prizesnewsShareReuse this content"

It was briefly – Starman reached No 18, and Space Oddity No 24 – but then it wasn’t.Each year, Forbes compiles a posthumous celebrity rich list. Bowie appeared in 2016, ranked atNo 11 with estimated earnings of $10.5m(£7.8m), and again in 2017, in the same position but withearnings of $9.5m(£7m). This was unsurprising given the enormous spike in interest there is in the immediate aftermath of a superstar’s death. Yet he didn’t appear in the Forbes list again until 2022, when he was at No 3 withearnings of $250m(£195m) – the highest-ranked musician that year – but that was almost all attributable tothe sale of his music publishing rightsto Warner Chappell.Unlike Prince, John Lennon, Elvis Presley, Bob Marley or Michael Jackson, Bowie has not become a Forbes fixture. And with publishing now removed from his earnings tally, he is unlikely to reappear in that list unless the estate sells the master recordings from 1968 onwards that it owns and currentlylicenses to Warner Music Group.Financial success is one measurement of posthumous success and importance. Streaming is another, where Bowie also underperforms for an artist of his stature. He currently has 22 million monthly listeners on Spotify compared with Bob Marley’s 26m, Whitney Houston’s 34m, Elvis Presley’s 45m and John Lennon’s 43m. Only one Bowie track makes it into Spotify’s “Billions Club”: Under Pressure, with more than 2bn plays. But that is presumably driven by Queen’s involvement, especially given they have a further seven tracks with more than a billion streams each.One explanation for this may be the Bowie estate’s difficulties in courting a new, young audience. While Bowie has an official profile on Instagram with three million followers, and TikTok with 656k, with the latter especially being home to younger fans, the estate’s focus has leaned heavily towards expensive box sets such asWho Can I Be Now? (1974–1976)and I Can’t Give Everything Away (2002–2016), as well as a plethora of live albums (13 in total since his death). This approach serves affluent middle-aged fans – but the releases are out of the price range and field of interest for teenagers who might become the Bowie obsessives of tomorrow. There has only been one greatest hits album released since his death, Legacy (The Very Best of David Bowie) in November 2016. It is arguable in the streaming age that playlists such as This Is David Bowie on Spotify and David Bowie Essentials on Apple Music do a better job.Bowie has also become the unofficial patron saint of BBC 6 Music – a positive in some senses, albeit one that only goes so far given that just2% of 6 Music’s audience are 24 or younger. Unlike in the 1980s, when he starred in Labyrinth (back in cinemas this weekfor its 40th anniversary) and The Snowman, there are few enticing entry points for the younger listeners who are essential to keep his legacy alive.View image in fullscreen‘A sourcebook for the Bowies of tomorrow’ … a  fraction of the items from the musician’s archive that are available to view at V&A East Storehouse’s David Bowie Centre in London.Photograph: David Parry/PAIt could be argued that Bowie’s estate is prizing quality over quantity, by saying no to more things than it green-lights. Itrefused to license musicto the Stardust biopic in 2021, endorsing instead Brett Morgen’sMoonage Daydreamdocumentary in 2022. The documentary Bowie: The Final Act waswell receivedwhen it was released last month, and shifts focus away from his imperial period in the 1970s to his commercial apex in the 1980s and his career beyond. There were also year-long Bowie 75 celebrations in 2021, to mark what would have been his 75th birthday, although that mostly seemed to mean arash of pop-up shopsin London and New York.Unquestionably the most interesting estate project was the opening last year of the David Bowie Centre at the V&A East Storehouse in London, where80,000 items from across his entire career– including handwritten lyrics, costumes and instruments – are stored. Tristram Hunt, the V&A’s director, called it a “new sourcebook for the Bowies of tomorrow” and it may prove to be the most enduring project.This could be read as the estate focusing on his long-term legacy rather than a short-term “algorithmic legacy” of chasing viral hits on TikTok and Spotify, which would risk reducing his ever-changing art to one song. The use of “Heroes” in the finale of Netflix’s Stranger Things last week was clearly hoped to vivify the track. It charted at No 34; by comparison, Kate Bush’s Running Up That Hillimmediately went Top 10after being used in the series in 2022. It also has only had 38k uses in TikTok videos to date – not exactly viral numbers.This quality-over-quantity thesis only holds up to a point. In 2022, the estate, albeitfor charitable reasons, embraced the short-lived digital gimmickry of NFTs,doing so again in 2023with an unheard version of Let’s Dance. And then there is the official Bowie store where, alongside the usual T-shirts and posters, you can buy a vast array of socks, a bar stool, a walnut cutting board or a baby’s bib. The site is choked with tchotchkes featuring the Aladdin Sane flash that has become synonymous with Bowie, reducing his many visual incarnations to a brief moment in 1973 – not unlike how US rockers Kiss became a visual brand more than a band. For such a future-facing artist, the future of Bowie’s legacy doesn’t seem so innovative, or assured.This article was updated on 9 January to reflect the chart position of “Heroes” the week after the Stranger Things finaleExplore more on these topicsDavid BowieMusic industryPop and rockV&AMuseumsMusic documentaryanalysisShareReuse this content"

This is partly because Greenland was one of those films in which Gerard Butler runs around looking as if he’s desperately trying to hold in a whopper of a fart. However, releasing a film about Americans focusing all their effort on Greenland at this precise moment in time feels a little on the nose.Greenland review – Gerard Butler v comet in solid disaster thrillerRead moreAlso, and hopefully this isn’t a spoiler, but it’s weird to make Greenland 2 when the entire world was destroyed at the end of Greenland 1. In that film, you will remember, Butler and his family had to get to Greenland because the planet was about to be pummelled by meteors.But hey, at least we can add the Greenland series to the long list of films that revel in destroying notable global landmarks. The trailer for the second one alone contains impressive shots of a half blown up Sydney Opera House and the Eiffel Tower listing over like a big banana.Depending on your point of view, this is either brilliant or depressing. For some, seeing a landmark get the snot kicked out of it by an extinction-level event is a decades-old cinematic mainstay. For others, it might start to feel a little bit tiresome. Really? The Eiffel Tower? Again?Some new researchby, fittingly, the insurance company MS Amlin, compiles the landmarks that get destroyed most often in movies. If it proves anything at all, it’s that Hollywood has a very shallow imagination.Prior to the Greenland films, for instance, the Eiffel Tower has been destroyed in Armageddon, Mars Attacks! Team America: World Police, Category 7: The End of the World, Aftermath: Population Zero, GI Joe: The Rise of Cobra and Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs. And, while not part of the MS Amlin list, it’s worth pointing out that the Sydney Opera House has previously been destroyed in X-Men: Apocalypse, Godzilla: Final Wars and Mega Shark vs Mecha Shark.View image in fullscreenBig Ben and Parliament destroyed in Reign of Fire.Photograph: ReutersHowever, these are by no means the most destroyed landmarks on the planet. Big Ben has got it at least nine times previously, in films such as Reign of Fire, V for Vendetta, London has Fallen, Flood, Gorgo and Tom & Jerry: The Fast and the Furry. And the Golden Gate Bridge has been wrecked at least 13 times, in films including Superman, San Andreas, Terminator: Genisys, Pacific Rim, Mega Shark vs Giant Octopus and It Came from Beneath the Sea.Way out in front, though, is the Statue of Liberty, which has been targeted in (deep breath): The Last War, Planet of the Apes, National Lampoon’s European Vacation, Superman IV: The Quest for Peace, Batman Forever, Independence Day, Mars Attacks, Deep Impact, Aftershock: Earthquake in New York, Artificial Intelligence, The Day After Tomorrow, Category 7: The End of the World, Tom and Jerry: The Fast & the Furry, Superman II, Transformers, Cloverfield, NYC: Tornado Terror, 2012 and GI Joe: The Rise of Cobra.This teaches us two things. The first is that we’ve all clearly been sleeping on Tom & Jerry: The Fast and the Furry. The second is that the film-makers of the world desperately need to find new landmarks to explode.View image in fullscreenClive Owen and Clare-Hope Ashitey in Children of Men, 2006.Photograph: AJ Pics/AlamyIt has been done in the past. When Harry O Hoyt chose to destroy something with a dinosaur in 1925, for example, he settled on the Blue Posts pub in Soho. Or, when Alfonso Cuarón decided to depict a real-life location to show untold depths of destruction in Children of Men, he opted for Bexhill-on-Sea. And where did Marvel choose to stage its most spectacular ever superhero-on-superhero battle when it came to filming Captain America: Civil War? That’s right, Leipzig airport.We need more of this, frankly. The movies can no longer rely on blowing up the same tired old landmarks. Let’s have a bit of invention. The next time aliens invade, let’s have them train their firepower onthe Spam Museumin Austin, Minnesota. If an out-of-control foreign government decides to train its nuclear arsenal on Europe, then let it aim its missiles at that tiny statue of the urinating boy in Brussels. We’ve seen meteors hit Earth a million times before, but have any of them ever taken out theCleethorpes Coast Light Railway? No, and this is precisely why cinema is dying.Explore more on these topicsFilm industryAction and adventure filmsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Watching Jennifer Saunders and Joanna Lumley, smashed on Bolly and falling out of cars, is my port in an emotional storm.Absolutely Fabulousmay not be soft and cosy (I’d argue that its humour only seems more vicious with time) but I know almost every line off by heart. Re-reading a much-loved book is soothing because you know what’s going to happen next but, for me, it’s the zingers in Ab Fab. Oh, you little bitch troll from hell …Rebecca NicholsonI’m Alan PartridgeView image in fullscreenAha! … Steve Coogan as Alan Partridge in I’m Alan Partridge.How many times have I watched the first, majestic series of I’m Alan Partridge? Enough to have left me helpless in the presence of big plates and farmers; enough certainly to have instilled a seemingly deathless yearning to dismantle a Corby trouser press. Thefamiliarityof each re-(re-re-) watch brings more comfort than I can say; every indignity (Alan concussed by a dead cow), every crushing self-humiliation (“Can I just shock you? I like wine”) a synaptic (peephole) Pringle of joy. Aha!Sarah DempsterThe Good PlaceView image in fullscreenLike hanging out with a great bunch of mates … Kristen Bell as Eleanor with William Jackson Harper as Chidi in The Good Place.Photograph: NBC/NBCU Photo Bank/Getty ImagesMike Schur consistently pulls off a brilliant trick: creating comedy dramas that manage to be clever and adventurous while also feeling as indulgent and comfortable as a blanket and a mug of hot chocolate. This gift reached its apotheosis in this snarky yet redemptive afterlife epic.The Good Placeis a dizzyingly inventive journey through the history of human belief systems which never forgets the things that make life worth living – love, laughter, friendship and hopefulness. And the chemistry between the leading quintet of actors is so cheerful and effortless that it feels like hanging out with a bunch of mates without leaving your sofa.Phil HarrisonUniversity ChallengeView image in fullscreenStarter for 10 … Amol Rajan with University Challenge contestants (from left) Anniko Firman, Brendan Bethlehem, Oscar Despard and Linus Luu.Photograph: BBCI know it may seem nonsensical – and that it probably leads lots of (most?) viewers to feel lowbrow – but the deep sense of joy I get fromUniversity Challengeknows no bounds. On Monday nights, I settle in to watch the great minds of tomorrow do their thing, show off their genius, and I am always left feeling that we may not be entirely stuffed as a society. I laugh when I don’t understand the questions (every single maths starter) and I love it when I know answers that they don’t (pretty much any question about pop music or literature by women). These days, my daughter cheers when I get questions right. I’ll cheer so much harder the first time she gets one.Kate AbbottGreat NewsView image in fullscreenThe finest comedy you will ever see … Tina Fey as Diana and Andrea Martin as Carol in Great News.Photograph: Greg Gayn/NBCGreat News, on Netflix, is something I could happily watch on a loop for the rest of my life. An absurdist Tina Fey-produced cable news sitcom, it contains at least two of the finest comedy performances you will ever see. Andrea Martin is breathlessly full-tilt as a retirement-age intern, while John Michael Higgins’s anchor Chuck Pierce is a blowhard for the ages. It should be too broad to work, but every episode is so packed with every imaginable style of joke that it flies. Every time I watch Great News, Iget angrythat there were only ever 23 episodes made. After a couple of months the anger subsides and I go back to the start again.Stuart HeritageFrasierView image in fullscreenThank God there are 264 episodes … Kelsey Grammer as Frasier, Moose as Eddie, John Mahoney as Martin and David Hyde Pierce as Niles.Photograph: Gale M Adler/Getty ImagesPerhaps it’s the memory of my mum laughing away on a Friday night, glass of red wine in hand, at the farcical antics of these two buffoonish intellectuals, Frasier and Niles Crane. But thissitcomalways banishes the callin’ blues. From Frasier’s great injustices and ego trips (who can forget the symphony he wrote for his radio show jingle?) to Niles’s descriptions of absent wife Maris (“I tried to follow her tracks in the snow but, alas, she made none”) and endless misunderstandings that land them in trouble (the Halloween episodewhere Niles thinks Daphne is pregnant is a hoot), it cracks me up every single time. More tender moments between the brothers and their ex-cop father Marty – who has no time for their snobby ways – give the show a big heart, too. Just look at the pause-for-thought scene were Frasier tries to get rid of Marty’s chair. The jazzy theme tune that Imustsing loudly to. The log fire in that dreamy Seattle penthouse. The coffee shop. Eddie the dog ... Thank God there are 264 episodes.Hollie RichardsonJamie OliverView image in fullscreenEpic! … Jamie Oliver in action.Photograph: Axel Heimken/DPA Picture Alliance/AlamyI’ve used cookery programmes as a pacifier all my life, so enthusiastically they’re the reason why four of my daughter’s first words were Jamie, Nigella and Mary Berry.Jamie Oliver, though, is the 15-tog duvet of TV chefs. I would watch him cook anything – yes, even curry in an air fryer. Seeing this middle-aged, mega-rich white man tug aubergines from the aspirational gardens of his rural Essex mansion, carry them to his rustic-chic barn conversion, then “hero” them in a dukkah roast chicken is the equivalent for me of a guided meditation. I can’t get enough of his knife skills. Every time he says “epic” I feel my heart rate slowing. And don’t get me started on my love for Conker, his dog.Chitra RamaswamyRuPaul’s Drag Race UKView image in fullscreenFeelgood fun … Nyonggbella in RuPaul’s Drag Race UK.Photograph: BBCIt is no coincidence that I started watchingRuPaul’s Drag Race UKin 2020, when cozy viewing felt imperative. Since then, it’s become my go-to for lazy Sundays, sick days and cold winter evenings – an easy pop of feelgood fun. The repetition – mini-challenge, maxi-challenge, runway, lip sync “for your life!” – feels reassuring; the baffling catchphrases (“She done already done had herses!”) oddly soothing. And, amid a fair amount of shade-throwing, there’s always a smattering of touching backstories, an underdog to root for and makeup to die for.Leah HarperVirgin RiverView image in fullscreenGlorious trash … Alexandra Breckenridge as Mel, Martin Henderson as Jack in Virgin River.Photograph: Courtesy of NetflixIt is a central pillar of Netflix lore: city woman (in this case nurse Mel) moves to a rural town and meets an impossibly handsome local (bar owner and former marine Jack) and we all know what happens next. But the main draw of this incomprehensibly paced soap opera is Charmaine, a woman whose pregnancy makes the gestation period of an elephant look speedy. In the five series it takes for her to reach full term, we see a fire almost tear downVirgin River, the local doctor go blind then regain his sight, the town mayor be overthrown, replaced, then reappointed and the local weed farm turn into a fentanyl pipeline – and get busted by the FBI. It is glorious, wonderful trash.Jenny StevensFriendsView image in fullscreenAlways there for you … Courteney Cox, Matthew Perry, Jennifer Aniston, David Schwimmer, Lisa Kudrow and Matt LeBlanc in Friends.Photograph: AlamyI cannot recall the first time I saw Monica, Rachel, Phoebe, Joey, Ross and Chandler –Friends, the seminal twentysomething sitcom, was always on at my house as a 90s kid. My memories of them are basically as old as those of their No 1 fan, my mother. As a teen, I watched all of Friends on DVD, yearning for adult freedom. As an adult, I rewatched it all on Netflix, yearning to go back. Now, I watch it seeking something more amorphous: familiarity, a reliable escape. The Friends’ giant New York apartments are a world and several eras away from my own. Yet something about Central Perk and Chanandler Bong and “Pivot!” and two across-the-hall purple doors will always, always feel like home.Jenny StevensTell us your favourite comfort TVRead moreDue SouthView image in fullscreenInstant bliss … Paul Gross as Constable Benton Fraser in Due South.Photograph: Colin Mason CM/LFI/London Features InternationalFrom the very first second of this heart-warming90s comedy crime showtheme tune, I am in bliss. Do not come at me with your questions about this tale of a Canadian mountie’s adventures with a loudmouth buddy cop. Yes, of course it’s daft that he (Paul Gross) solves crimes through the power of sheer kindness and – troublingly – licking random bits of evidence he finds on the floor. But it’s often hilarious, and the tale of friendship at its heart is genuinely touching. Plus, it featured youthful bit-parts from Mark Ruffalo, Carrie-Anne Moss and Ryan Phillippe and its creator, Paul Haggis, went on to be an Oscar-winning screenwriter. Cosy TV with credentials.Alexi DugginsLovesickView image in fullscreenTotal recall… Antonia Thomas as Evie and Johnny Flynn as Dylan in Lovesick.Photograph: Brian SweeneyIt always makes me chuckle thatLovesickwas once known asScrotal Recall. Naff former title aside, this sparky romcom has a lot of fun with its novel premise: Johnny Flynn’s Dylan finds out he has chlamydia and has to tell his exes that he has an STD. Cue hilariously awkward encounters, endless shenanigans with his friends (Daniel Ings as Luke, his best mate, is a comedy tour de force) and a will-they-won’t-they romance that out-smoulders Ross and Rachel’s between Dylan and Evie (Antonia Thomas). It’s a beautifully written show that digs into the messiness of love and the power of friendship, and a regular in my rewatch rotation. It’s perfect comfort TV – heartwarming and moving with the actors providing a cosy blanket of non-stop laughs to wrap around you as the chill of winter descends.Ann LeeSex and the CityView image in fullscreenStill feels thrillingly alive … Cynthia Nixon as Miranda Hobbes, Kim Cattrall as Samantha Jones, Kristin Davis as Charlotte York and Sarah Jessica Parker and Carrie Bradshaw in Sex and the City.Photograph: HBOWhen I was an unkissed teenager,Sex and the Cityprovided the giddy promise of dates and sex to come. When I lived in New York after the show had just ended, it offered the only relatable reflection of the city as it was then (on-location Manhattan shooting, how I miss you). When I lived in London in the years after, it felt like an old friend, a bittersweet reminder of a place and life I missed. Now, living in New York again, it’s closer to a historical document, both of the city and of my youth. It ended long ago but life always finds new reasons for me to rewatch a show of such electric energy that even years after it died, it still feels thrillingly alive.Benjamin LeePinguView image in fullscreenChilly escapades … Pingu.Photograph: Hit EntertainmentYou can’t beat a burst ofPinguon hisYouTube channel. The mischievous shapeshifting penguin– now stretched, now splat-like, now deploying that ferocious trumpet-like beak – is fabulously irate yet cheeringly irrepressible too. Each chilly escapade in this winter wonderland (sleighing, fishing, snowball-fighting) is warmly observed; the episode where little sister Pinga is born is a three-minute primer for growing families. Plus – ultimate comfort! – there’s not even any dialogue to follow as, apart from Robby the Seal’s occasional honk, it’s mostly told in the nonsense language of Penguinese. Moot moot!Chris WiegandNigellaView image in fullscreenDomestic goddess … Nigella Lawson.Photograph: Craig Sjodin/ABC/Getty ImagesMy severe case of eldest daughter syndrome (AKA type-A control freakery accompanied by a pathological sense of duty) has lumbered me with a paradox: I can only truly relax when I’m doing something constructive. Or can kid myself that I am. Enter the cookery programme. Let me gaze absently uponNigella’s sumptuously well-stocked larder (or the pared-back perfection of Nigel Slater’s kitchen garden or the serene order of Mary Berry’s countertop) safe in the knowledge that I’m also passively absorbing heaps of useful advice about preparing a noodle soup or the perfect chocolate cake. What could be more productive?Rachel AroestiArrested DevelopmentView image in fullscreenA ton of fun … Jason Bateman as Michael, Portia De Rossi as Lindsay, Jeffrey Tambor as George Sr and Jessica Walter as Lucille in Arrested Development.Photograph: 20th Century FoxI remember almost every major gag inArrested Development(they’re too good to forget, really) and yet every single time I watch it makes me laugh as if it’s the first time all over again. The meta misfortunes of the Bluth family – which boasts a banged-up patriarch, a son-in-law with a humiliation kink, a gaggle of dysfunctional siblings and, we’re told, “the one son who had no choice but to keep them all together” – are frequently absurd, but totally brilliant. Steer clear of the awful Netflix reboot, resist the urge to paint yourself blue à la Tobias Fünke, and you’re bound to have a ton of fun.Hannah J DaviesExplore more on these topicsTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Or a friendly young woman with flowing locks and a crown of braids?To Belgian art dealer Klaas Muller, an answer to that question mattered less than the fact that this particular take on the duck-rabbit optical illusion was painted by one Peter Paul Rubens.Three years ago, the Brussels-based former gallerist managed to effectively acquire not just one but two studies of heads by the Flemish baroque master in one painting, paying the “reasonable price” of less than €100,000 at an online auction.The auctioneer, which Muller would identify only as a “lesser-known auction house in northern Europe” for fear of encouraging too much future competition, had advertised the work as an undated study on paper by an anonymous master of the “Flemish school”.View image in fullscreenThe study of an old man was painted on a reused sheet of paper, and when turned over, the silhouette of a woman’s head appears through the model’s beard.Composite: Peter Paul Rubens/Klaas Muller/Brafa Art FairIn the recent past,studies by Rubenshave sold for between £500,000 and £1m or more.“I wasn’t sure it was a Rubens, I just knew it was very Rubens-esque, so it was still a gamble,” said Muller, who describes himself as a passionate admirer of the 1577-born artist and diplomat. “I have a library of books about him at home and look at them most evenings,” he told the Guardian. “It’s a bit of an addiction.”He felt more confident when the painting was delivered to his home. “It was very dirty, but the varnish had protected the painting very well and I could see that it was of extremely high quality.”But it was not until after the picture was studied for several months last year by the art historian Ben van Beneden, a former director of the Rubens House, that Muller started to feel confident he had acquired a genuine old master.“I think it’s very likely,” said van Beneden. “You have to be cautious because you are dealing with a painting that wasn’t made for the market but as a working material. But the craftsmanship is outstanding – it has a very lifelike quality.”The old man figure in the study appears in several of Rubens’ better-known paintings. “He is omnipresent and versatile,” wrote the Belgian newspaper De Standaard, which broke the news of the painting’s discovery this week.In The Raising of the Cross, a raised altarpiece in Antwerp Cathedral, the old man is depicted as Saint Amandus. InThe Adoration of the Magi, which hangs in the Prado museum in Madrid, he is a red-cloaked King Melchior. InThe Tribute Money, at the Legion of Honour museum in San Francisco, he is the Pharisee peeking out from behind Jesus.View image in fullscreenThe Adoration of the Magi, Peter Paul Rubens, 1609 and 1628-29, features the same model as a red-cloaked Melchoir.Photograph: Museo del PradoInspired by Italian painters, Rubens collated a series of different physiognomies he could use for larger paintings.He is known to have created a prototype study of the old man’s head that has since been lost. “Muller may indeed have found the prototype,” van Beneden said.Long-lost Rubens painting sells for $2.7m at auctionRead moreThe woman inside the old man’s beard, however, was painted first. Rather than trying to create an optical illusion, Rubens probablyreused the paperof an earlier painting and traced over it, Muller said.The painting hangs in Muller’s home and will go on display at the Brafa art fair in Brussels on 25 January. Even as a study, the art dealer said, it deserved as wide an audience as possible. He hoped that a museum would agree to take the painting on a long-term loan.Explore more on these topicsArtNetherlandsBelgiumPaintingEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

You absolutely marvel at her in this darker second outingRachel AroestiFri 9 Jan 2026 03.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 9 Jan 2026 03.16 ESTShareThe problem with havingErin Dohertystar in your TV drama is that it makes it extremely difficult to tell whether it’s any good or not. The 33-year-old is more than an impressive actor – she is a magnetic presence, able to sell the idea that sheactuallyisher character in a way few others can (a particularly impressive feat considering her breakthrough was playing Princess Anne in The Crown). As such, Doherty’s participation in a series can elevate the premise, plot and script in a slightly confusing way. Watching the first few episodes of Steven Knight’s late-Victorian thrillerA Thousand Blows, I wasn’t sure whether I was genuinely enjoying the programme or simply marvelling at Doherty’s effervescent turn as wily, tough-as-boots pickpocketing queen Mary Carr.Series two makes it easier to spot the difference. While the first outing suffered from its share of heavy-handed exposition, the tale of an East End boxer (played by Doherty’s Adolescence co-star Stephen Graham) whose local dominance is undone by a smart Jamaican fighter (Malachi Kirby) was propulsive and slick, and the presence of the Forty Elephants – a real all-female crime syndicate – was giddily novel. The rivalry between Henry “Sugar” Goodson (old school, bare-knuckle, chip-on-both-shoulders, mildly deranged) and Hezekiah Moscow (young, fun, good-hearted, and willing to cash in on the gentrified west London boxing scene) was a framework that allowed room for commentary on colonialism, racism, tradition and class. Throw in Mary and her mischievous colleagues and you also had a compelling exploration of female empowerment, poverty and the psychology of risk and reward.This time round, the action is less punchy and amusing, and more just really, really depressing. Admittedly, we did leave things on a three-pronged downer last time: Hezekiah was essentially a pariah, having inadvertently killed white New York boxing champ Buster Williams in the ring; Sugar was desolate, having beaten his brother Edward “Treacle” Goodson (James Nelson-Joyce) to a pulp for a perceived slight; and Mary was persona non grata, having led the Elephants on a perilous wild goose chase after some worthless silver-plated tat and been rejected by Hezekiah after he realised she knew more than she’d let on about his best friend’s murder.Still, things can always be worse. And in the series two opener, they are. Sugar is now a drunken down-and-out, rolling across the Wapping cobbles. Hezekiah is reduced to fighting on the barge-based underground boxing scene in front of openly racist crowds. And Mary is at the beck and call of her ruthless mother Jane (Susan Lynch), who is in turn at the beck and call of her brutal boss Indigo Jeremy (a deeply unsettling Robert Glenister). It’s all very grim.But you can’t keep a morally ambivalent woman down, and soon Mary is back to her old tricks; a bank heist here, a bait and switch there. In lieu of a neat storyline involving Sugar and Hezekiah, it’s Mary’s planned robbery of a Caravaggio with a mesmerist named Sophie Lyons, one of her father’s New York associates, that forms the narrative backbone of this series, and persuades her dispersed band of lady thieves to reunite.‘I wouldn’t answer Stephen Graham’s calls’: Erin Doherty on dreams, danger and ghosting Adolescence’s creatorRead moreHezekiah’s comeback takes a little longer. He spends much of this series unhappily training the puny Prince Albert Victor in the art of boxing before returning to the ring himself. Yet the Goodson brothers aren’t so resilient: with the formerly sensible Treacle transformed by the head injury Sugar inflicted, the pair tag team between patriarchal problem-solving and alcoholic mania – it’s honestly hard to keep up with the frequency Sugar boards and disembarks the wagon.Ostensibly, there is plenty of action – various villains are after our trio of (also villainous) protagonists, and people are hurt along the way – but it doesn’t feel as if much is at stake. At times, Sugar’s aimless bewilderment seems to seep into the bones of the show itself. Hezekiah’s quest to establish himself in Britain while haunted by the violence he witnessed in Jamaica gave series one depth and direction – yet so profound is the boxer’s disillusionment that now even his wins feel hollow. And while Mary can still execute a cunning plan, her joy in bettering her betters also crumbles. Instead we get glimpses of what haunts her: an unhappy childhood; the prospect of an impoverished future and a lonely death. Doherty takes these fleeting insights and turns them into a psychodrama that leaves a lasting impression. But that says more about her talent than the quality of this muddled second outing.A Thousand Blows is on Disney+ now.Explore more on these topicsHistorical drama (TV)TV reviewTelevisionStephen GrahamDramareviewsShareReuse this content"

Aside from a harrowing sequence of actual death camp footage, James Vanderbilt’s intense drama comes at the historic event from the angle of cocky American psychiatrist Douglas Kelley (Rami Malek), tasked with assessing the defendants’ mental health. He finds himself in a battle of wills with lead Nazi Hermann Göring (a chillingly smug Russell Crowe), one that he’s not really capable of winning. Michael Shannon gets a chunk of screentime as US judge Robert H Jackson, but it’s when Malek and Crowe go head to head that the film really clicks.Simon WardellPeople We Meet on Vacation (Brett Haley, 2026), NetflixThe first movie based on a novel by bestselling author Emily Henry comes to Netflix, established home of easily digestible, sun-spangled romdrams.

This poignant and perceptive coming-of-age story, about two strangers who become star-crossed lovers, is a powerful portrait of the lived realities of immigrants in Britain, and of love as home, hope and destiny.Newly arrived in England following an arranged marriage with British-Indian Rajiv, Mira feels increasingly out of place as she finds out that Rajiv holds secrets and loves someone else. On the eponymous Belgrave Road in Leicester, entire days go by “without sight of an English person”, and Mira feels “disappointed that England wasn’t as foreign or as mysterious as she had hoped”. She takes English classes, finds companionship in her mother-in-law and fills her days with household chores, but nothing shifts her deep loneliness.Tahliil is an asylum seeker from Somalia, who, together with his sister, Sumayya, joins their mother in Leicester. He works as an at-home carer and at a cash-and-carry for cash-in-hand while he waits for the Home Office to grant his request for asylum. With a chequered past and an uncertain future, he feels untethered to and untrusting of the world around him. That is, until he sees Mira, who has started working as a cook at the neighbouring sweet shop.With Belgrave Road, the debut author proves that he can sustain a well-crafted and plotted novel over 350 pagesWhat follows is a love story that is tender and true, fragile and arguably forbidden: “In the space of a few syllables, the world began to contract around them.” In a classic will they, won’t they tale that keeps the reader on tenterhooks, the novel dwells on the unknown: the precariousness of their individual futures and of course their future together, “how unprepared he was, how unprepared they both were, for their own happiness”.In the face of such uncertainty, and through Mira and Tahliil’s in-laws and parents – who have endured that often elusive experience called life – Chauhan cleverly shows the stark contrasts in beliefs between generations. Mira’s own mother believes “the body to be a vessel of truth – every feeling, every struggle woven into its meat, its bones”. Now, as Mira looks at her mother-in-law, who suffers abuse at her husband’s hands, she wonders whether those words hold true, or whether “the body was as prone to deceit as everything else”. Tahliil, too, questions his mother’s words when she says: “Sometimes you have to wait. What is meant to be yours will always be yours.”And although Chauhan rehearses some familiar narratives about south Asian men and arranged marriages, he smashes one of the deepest-set stereotypes in south Asian stories: that of the evil, wicked mother-in-law. Mira’s deep bond with hersaasuis an intergenerational portrait of two south Asian women navigating the trials and tribulations of immigrant and family life. Ultimately, what emerges between them is a strong sisterhood and a fierce duty of care towards each other. Small gestures of love – oiling each other’s hair, making food – turn into radical acts of protection and liberation in a household where the men make their presence felt with a heavy hand or rough tongue, so much so that when Mira contemplates abandoning her marriage, it’s this loss that we prematurely mourn.Chauhan’s short fiction has already been acclaimed, and with Belgrave Road, the debut author proves that he can also sustain a well-crafted and plotted novel over 350 pages. This story of love beyond borders and immigrants without anchor points (“Each time a person moves country, they leave a part of themselves behind. We end up homeless. Belonging nowhere”) is full of heart and heartbreak, and defiantly explores the destinies we write for ourselves.At one point, Tahliil’s father tells him “that the past was like a piece of string, stitched to the inside of a person’s heart. One could never be entirely free of it.” Belgrave Road shows us that, sometimes, the promise of a future is all it takes to fight the ghosts of one’s past.Belgrave Road by Manish Chauhan is published by Faber (£16.99).

In recent years, diaspora artists such as Egyptian producer Abdullah Miniawy, singer Nadah El Shazly and Lebanese singer-songwriter Mayssa Jallad have each released records that combine the Arabic musical tradition of maqam and its slippery melodies with granular electronic sound design, rumbling bass and metallic drum programming to create a dramatic new proposition.View image in fullscreenThe artwork for WahjBeirut-born and Amsterdam-based composer Toni Geitani is the latest to contribute to this growing scene with his masterfully produced second album Wahj (“radiance” in Arabic). Working as a visual artist and sound designer, Geitani is well versed in creating imaginative soundscapes for films such as 2024 sci-fi Radius Collapse, as well as referencing the shadowy nocturnal hiss of producers such as Burial on his dabke-sampling 2018 debut album Al Roujoou Ilal Qamar. On Wahj, he harnesses soaring layali vocalisations, reverb-laden drums and analogue synths to leave a cinematic impression.Opener Hal sets a plaintive tone with a yearning cello solo from Nia Ralinova and Geitani’s melismatic vocals meandering over the slow, thrumming notes of a synthesiser. Its gentle mood is soon shattered, however, by the thundering drums and doomy synths of following numbers Ya Sah and La, the blast beat cacophony of Tuyoor and the industrial techno distortions of Fawqa al Ghaym. With its bellowing vocals and clattering percussive motif, Ya Aman and some similar fare can veer into Hans Zimmer-style heightened melodrama. But Geitani otherwise keeps a deft handle on his world-building, ensuring that threads of unease keep listeners guessing. Highlight Ruwaydan Ruwaydan tempers a pleasant jazz swing groove with an unexpected beat-switch and piercing ney flute line, while closing track Madda Mudadda builds from calming ambience into a crushing chaos of static and whispered melody. Geitani revels in this state of dark tension, creating an album that challenges us to find beauty in a ruinous sound.Also out this monthTuareg groupImarhanrelease their latest album, Essam (City Slang). Moving beyond the psychedelic guitars and yearning vocals of Tuareg assouf (desert blues) pioneers Tinariwen, Essam sees Imarhan including an electronic thump on tracks such as the earworming Derhan N’Oulhine and dancefloor-focused drum programming on Okcheur. Palestinian rapperTamer Nafar’s first English-language album In the Name of the Father, the Imam & John Lennon (Levantine Music) channels everything from a James Brown funk swagger on Rock It Like a Palestinian to 808 trap bass on Nana, delivering a brash yet tonally uneven set of tracks. Brazilian jazz groupGrupo Um’s Nineteen Seventy Seven (Far Out Recordings) is a rare gem of a rediscovery. Comprised of members from Hermeto Pascoal’s mid-70s São Paulo band, the quintet’s previously lost second album is a crate-diggers’ delight of propulsive funk-jazz fusion, analogue synths and soaring horns.Explore more on these topicsMusicGlobal album of the monthExperimental musicreviewsShareReuse this content"

The 1935 song in which he captured the idea, a lilting tango, forms the lodestar ofKatie Bray’s voyage through Weill’s chameleonic songwriting career, undertaken alongside the pianist William Vann, accordionist Murray Grainger and double bassist Marianne Schofield, the latter moonlighting from the Hermes Experiment.First, we hear a haunting, unaccompanied musing on the Youkali melody, then more of these punctuate the programme until we reach the song in full at the end. The journey takes in numbers in German, French and English – some familiar, some not – including a couple of songs written for the Huckleberry Finn musical Weill was working on at the time of his death.View image in fullscreenThe artwork for In Search of Youkali: Songs of Kurt Weill.Photograph: ChandosBray and Vann have been developing this programme together for years, and it shows in their easy fluency; the other two instruments are used tellingly, painting in subtle rather than primary colours. As for Bray, she is outstanding. From the deliciously acerbic Barbarasong to the bleakly controlled emotion in Je ne t’aime pas, her singing is a demonstration of how an elevated, “trained” voice can sound wonderfully communicative and natural in this music.Allow content provided by a third party?This article includes content hosted onembed.music.apple.com.

We sample plant-based schnitzel, ramen and, of course,pierogiRachel DixonFri 9 Jan 2026 02.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 9 Jan 2026 04.18 ESTSharePinny on, hands dusted with flour, I rolled out dough, cut it into circles, added a spoonful of filling and sealed it into little parcels. I was getting stuck into a dumpling cooking class in one of the most vegan-friendly cities in the world. Makinggyozain Tokyo, perhaps? Wontons in Singapore? Potstickers in Taipei?In fact, I was preparingpierogiin Warsaw. Friends who associate Polish cuisine with stews and sausages were surprised to hear it, but vegan food has proliferated across the country over the past 20 years. Happy Cow, the veteran vegan restaurant guide, now consistentlyranks Warsaw in its top cities globally– last year it was in 11th place, ahead of Bangkok, San Francisco and Copenhagen.Poland may be best known for its meat dishes, but fungi and vegetables such as potatoes, cabbage, beetroot and cucumbers have long been central to its food culture. Agnieszka Skrodzka, a Warsaw tour guide specialising in plant-based food, says it is far easier to avoid meat than mushrooms – as she found out when she recently developed a mushroom allergy. As Karol Adamiak, a chef from Warsaw,wrote in the Guardian last year: “Veganism represents a return to Poland’s peasant roots, and a more conscious and healthy way of eating.”I was inspired to visit Poland after I wrote aboutholidaying as a veganlast summer, and several readers recommended the country. One sang the praises of Gdańsk, and I was also tempted by Kraków, but Happy Cow’sfindingswere hard to argue with: Warsaw has an impressive 34 vegan restaurants, rising to 80 if you include vegetarian restaurants with vegan options, and another 200-odd “vegan-friendly” places.View image in fullscreenPeerless pierogi, the dumpling that is emblematic of Polish cuisineChallenge accepted: my sister and I set about eating as much as humanly possible in three days. We started with vegan versions of traditional Polish dishes, including huge plates of pierogi with spinach and tofu (£7) and potato pancakes with crispy oyster mushrooms (£8) atVege Miasto, the oldest vegan restaurant in the city. Comfort food such as soy schnitzel with mash and beetroot (£8) atVeganda, and Silesian potato dumplings with soy meat, gravy and fried onions (£8) atLokal Vegan Bistro, helped us cope with the bitter cold of a Warsaw winter.Then we went global. First, a colourful meze platter for two (£17.50) atFalla, a Middle Eastern-inspired restaurant that also has branches in Gdynia, Poznań, Wrocław and Katowice. Next, brimming bowls of noodle soup (£10) atVegan Ramen Shop, which has three outlets across the city. Our favourite variety was the tan-tan men: a creamy, spicy broth made from tahini, chilli oil, black vinegar and Sichuan peppercorns. We also scoffed a mound of spaghetti “carbonara” with vegan bacon and artichokes (£8) at Lokal, and a classic crispy tofu burger (£9) at Veganda. Finally, we squeezed in brunch atBistro Jaskółka– I sampledshakshukawith tofu scramble and my sister heroically worked her way through the fry-up (both about £7).There were many other highly recommended restaurants we simply couldn’t fit in, either due to our schedule or our bellies – I was particularly disappointed not to try a platter of plant-based sushi atVegan Sushi Bar.Even our hotel,Puro Stare Miasto, had three vegan dishes on the à la carte breakfast menu; I loved the porridge with forest fruit compote, olive oil and herbs. This Scandi-style hotel group (at Polish prices) has branches in Warsaw, Gdańsk, Kraków, Łódź, Poznań and Wrocław, plus Budapest and Prague.View image in fullscreenNo beef with this: Silesian potato dumplings at Lokal Vegan Bistro.Photograph: Rachel DixonTo work up an appetite for our next meal, which was never far away, we walked all over the city: through the charmingOldandNew Towns, along theRoyal Route, up to the 30th-floor viewing platform of the StalinistPalace of Culture and Science(in the lift, admittedly), and around lovelyRoyal Łazienki Park. We visited somerevitalised former industrial spaces, such as theNorblin Factoryand theWarsaw Brewery, now full of cafes, restaurants and shops. At theMuseum of Modern Art, we saw a fascinating exhibition called The Woman Question, featuring 150 female artists from Artemisia Gentileschi to Cindy Sherman (until 3 May).And, of course, we learned to make our own pierogi.Pierogi & Moreruns cooking classes that cater to all; our group consisted of us two vegans, three vegetarians and five meat-eaters. We all made a simple flour and water dough, then added our own fillings: the vegan ones contained mashed potato and beans, and chickpeas and lentils, with various herbs and spices. The most challenging part, and the most satisfying, was attempting different ways of sealing and folding them. We started with classic half-moons with crimped edges, and moved on to more complex shapes, such as mini cornish pasties with a pleated “crust”, and ring-shaped tortellini.A train tour of Europe’s cool northern capitals: from London to Vilnius, via Berlin and WarsawRead moreThe only potential downside was the communal taste-test afterwards: as every vegan knows, everyone wants to try yours, but you can’t try theirs. In our case, it was for the best: this was just elevenses and we had lunch scheduled afterwards. The couple of pierogi I did gulp down, topped with slow-cooked onions, were delicious.Is Warsaw really one of the most vegan-friendly cities in the world? In my brief experience, yes – and I live in the top-ranked city (London) and have visited seven ofthe top 10. The food is also far more affordable than in most of the other highly rated cities.By the end of our vegan eating odyssey, much like the dumplings, we were stuffed. But in for a penny … We grabbed a takeout box of pastries fromBaja, a vegan patisserie, to sustain us on the journey home. It turns out there’s always room for a Lotus Biscoff doughnut.The trip was provided by theWarsaw Tourism Office.

If the topping browns too quickly, loosely cover again with the foil.Remove the apples from the oven, leave to cool slightly, then serve with cream, yoghurt or vanilla ice-cream.Explore more on these topicsFoodThe sweet spotDessertFruitWinter food and drinkBakingVegan food and drinkVegetarian food and drinkrecipesShareReuse this content"
