Illustration: WingårdhsA casual mention of Kate Raworth’s theory has grown into the basis for decision making in TomelillaByAbigail SykesThu 17 Jul 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 17 Jul 2025 12.10 EDTShareIn a small town inSweden, the local authority is carrying out an unusual experiment.In 2021 one of the team had been reading an article about the concept of doughnut economics – a circular way of thinking about the way we use resources – and he brought it up. “I just mentioned it casually at a meeting, as a tool to evaluate our new quality of life programme, and it grew from there,” says Stefan Persson, Tomelilla’s organisational development manager.The concept, developed by British economist Kate Raworth is fairly straightforward. The outer ring or ecological ceiling of the doughnut consists of the nine planetary boundaries. These are the environmental limits that humans are at risk of passing – we’ve already crossed the safety thresholds on climate change, ocean acidification and biogeochemical flows, for example, but remain within safe limits on our atmospheric aerosol loading. The inner ring forms a social foundation of life’s essentials, and the “dough” in between corresponds to a safe and just space for humanity, which meets the needs of people and planet. The model also includes principles such as systems thinking and seeing the economy as a tool, not a goal in itself.“Doughnut economics is like running a farm. Using an excess of resources, like nutrients, on your crops is a mistake. Not using enough is a mistake too,” says Persson’s colleague Per-Martin Svensson, who is a farmer when he is not doing council work.Putting the schema into action is challenging, but doughnut economics is being used in Tomelilla, in Sweden’s southern Skåne region, in several ways. It has been integrated into financial planning and decision support, so that rather than building a new ice rink, the plan is now to revamp an existing building.View image in fullscreenTomelilla’s diagram shows how well it is keeping within the doughnut of resources, with climate change, ocean acidification, biodiversity and health the main challenges.Photograph: Tomelilla MunicipalityThe local government produces an annual portrait of how well it is doing at meeting doughnut economics targets. The best results in the latest diagram were on air quality, housing and social equality. Air quality in the area was good to begin with, but in order to keep improving it, young people at lower and upper secondary school have been given a free travel card for public transport. It is hoped the measure will also improve social equality in terms of access to education and health. Overcrowding and income disparities have both decreased, but it’s hard to link that directly to any of the council’s work.Education is a priority, but targets such as carbon emissions, biodiversity and health are more difficult to meet. Emissions have not been decreasing, but in 2023 the town council adopted a climate programme to achieve net zero by 2045. Other measures include employing a municipal ecologist and improving access to outdoor recreation.Tomelilla’s flagship doughnut economics project, though, is planning a new school. The council hasn’t built a school – or any other big development – since the 1990s.The planet’s economist: has Kate Raworth found a model for sustainable living?Read moreThe project is still at an early stage so no decisions have been made about the final construction.Last year, a consultant report made recommendations for the project. These included using existing and carbon-neutral materials as far as possible, growing hemp as a building material on the current site; building the school around a greenhouse for growing vegetables as well as for educational and social activities; and making the school an off-grid energy producer using solar power and batteries.A goal is for the space to be flexible, to adapt to large variations in the size of cohorts of children, with buildings that can be used for adult education as well as after-hours meeting places to support social sustainability and community.This vision has carried over into the council’s procurement requirements, although budget constraints and other considerations have meant it is still unclear whether all of these ideas will come to fruition. However, Persson sees it as a win that this type of vision has even been included in the process. “It would be much easier to procure a ready-made concept. Our politicians have been really brave letting us do this.”It has certainly been demanding. Is it even possible to use the resources needed for a large construction project and stay within the doughnut? Persson thinks it may not be possible but he is focusing on the bigger picture, with a more holistic view of social change. “In individual projects, there are always trade-offs. But we’re also looking at how the local community as a whole can move towards the doughnut model. I think that if we’re going to build anything, it should be democratic meeting places and schools.”View image in fullscreenThe theory of doughnut economics was created by the economist Kate Raworth.Photograph: Jeff Morgan 03/AlamyThe conversation has grown beyond new physical infrastructure. Local schools are discussing more philosophical questions such as what a school is and what it is for, as well as the future of educational approaches.Tomelilla is the first local government to attempt to deliver infrastructure and education using doughnut economics, according to Leonora Grcheva, the cities and regions lead at Doughnut Economics Action Lab, who says the town “was an early adopter and is one of the more committed, innovative and ambitious places, in terms of finding different opportunities to bring these ideas into its work”.With a population of about 7,000, it is certainly one of the smallest towns in the international network of the Doughnut Economics Action Lab, dwarfed by Barcelona, Glasgow and Mexico City, which are all putting Raworth’s theories into practice in local governments.Other towns and cities are working on their own projects inspired by doughnut economics: Ipoh in Malaysia is developing a plan for a regenerative economy, with demonstrator projects in areas such as ecotourism, climate resilience and low-carbon food choices, and in 2022 Mexico City used the theory to develop two potential scenarios for the city in 2040, demonstrating the social and ecological impacts of different pathways.The people of Tomelilla welcome the challenge and are extremely proud of the way their town is forging a path. As Jonna Olsson, one of the staff at the council says: “Doughnut economics is a really interesting way to work with sustainability. It feels cool to be a cog in international change.”This article was amended on 17 July 2025. A previous version said that ocean acidification remains within safe limits, which is not the case.Explore more on these topicsThe alternativesSwedenEconomic policySustainable developmentClimate crisisGreenhouse gas emissionsEthical and green livingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Then Keir Starmer and the French president had made no effort to conceal their affection for one another. A thousand ways to sayje t’aime. They had even concluded their hour in front of the cameras with an awkward hug, unsure if a kiss on the cheek would be out of place. Exactly a week on, it was time for the German chancellor,Friedrich Merz, to share a platform with the prime minister at the Airbus factory in Stevenage. This one ended with a formal handshake and little eye contact.That wasn’t the only difference between the two pressers. The one with Macron had started an hour late, a sure sign that Starmer had been trying and failing to secure a better deal on the returns agreement with France. This one began as scheduled. Most of the details had been signed off days, if not weeks ago. The one-day visit of the German chancellor merely a matter of protocol. But it was, in its way, an equally significant occasion. The first friendship and bilateral cooperation treaty between the UK and Germany. A coming of age. A relationship of equals with no place for tabloid stereotypes.Keir got things under way with a quick resume of what had been agreed. A defence partnership. New investments. Ease of access between the two countries for both schoolchildren and frequent travellers. Cooperation on irregular migration. A new rail route between England and Germany. Albeit a reannouncement of one that had already been announced. Though it would be churlish to make a fuss of this on a good news day. A commitment to continue to be appalled by the situation in Gaza. But not to be so appalled that either country would actually do anything about it.Then it was over to Merz. He began by speaking in English, saying how proud he was to have signed the newly named Kensington treaty. Then he switched to German. To spare Keir’s blushes. Because in his next breath he said how much he deploredBrexit. Even Macron hadn’t gone that far a week ago, merely expressing regret. Starmer does his best to forget Brexit. Likes to pretend it never happened. That for some unknown reason we found ourselves outside the EU. He went on to talk about Ukraine and the newly formed alliance of the E3. Germany, France and the UK.Time for the questions. First up was Sky News’s political editor who talked and talked and talked. Almost as if she thought this was a three-way press conference with her, Starmer and Merz. Every time you thought she had come to an end, she came up with yet another long-winded question.By the third minute, Starmer was beginning to look a bit uncomfortable. Perhaps he wondered if she would ever stop. Merz, though, was a revelation. He was loving it. “Thank you for your brief questions,” he smiled. He would love to answer them all. He had nothing better to do with his life than stand around in the factory for the rest of the day. It was top bantz. His answers turned out to be a great deal shorter than the questions. Friedrich not only had a decent sense of humour, he was modest with it. He may look like a technocrat but he also has a charm that becomes more and more obvious the longer you spend in his company.For Keir, the main domestic question was his decision tosuspend the whip of four backbenchers. Why bother? Why not let them do what they wanted? Much like Tony Blair had done with the 47 Labour MPs who had voted against his welfare bill in 1997. After all, it wasn’t as if his majority was ever under threat. So why not live and let live? Give the appearance of being a broad church where a variety of opinions can be tolerated.For the only time during the press conference, Starmer looked a bit rattled. “We were elected to change the country for the better,” he said, somewhat testily. The suspension of the whip hadn’t been for the party’s benefit, he went on. It had been for the country. Which was strange. It hadn’t looked that way. It had seemed a sign of petulance. Weakness even. The unofficial version was that the MPs had been suspended for persistent knobheadery. Though you could say knobheadery cuts both ways. Something for Labour to consider.But if Keir couldn’t tolerate some of his own MPs who had voted differently to him, earlier in the day he had been all in favour of widening the franchise. In response to an urgent question from the Conservative Paul Holmes, the junior democracy minister Rushanara Ali had announced the government would be extending the vote to 16-year-olds, as well as restricting the influence of foreign money in UK elections.Merz calls for UK, Germany and France to align on migration and defenceRead moreNeedless to say the Tories weren’t at all happy about this. Right now, they would prefer to restrict voting eligibility to the over-75s. And even then they wouldn’t be guaranteed to win an election. Holmes couldn’t quite bring himself to say that no self-respecting 16-year-old would be seen dead voting Conservative, so he rummaged around for ever more specious reasons to say lowering the voting age was a bad thing.You couldn’t buy cigarettes or alcohol until you were 18 so why should you get to vote? Perhaps he felt you needed to be pissed to enter a ballot box. Holmes hadn’t quite grasped that you could join the Tory party at 15 and vote for a leader. Talking of which, the Tories are in no position to give lectures on voting ethics. They were the party that foisted Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak on us, without giving us a chance to say what we thought about it.The Lib Dems’ Sarah Olney was all in favour of lowering the age limit but wondered if the government might go further. To something like proportional representation. Ali closed that door swiftly. The Lib Dems had had their chance and blown it. End of. You could have too much of a good thing with democracy.Explore more on these topicsKeir StarmerThe politics sketchFriedrich MerzBrexitForeign policyEuropean UnionEuropecommentShareReuse this content"

Perhaps Tony Blair could give him some tipsThu 17 Jul 2025 11.20 EDTLast modified on Thu 17 Jul 2025 14.29 EDTShareThis is a sign of weakness, not strength. Tosuspend four MPsfor rebellion suggests a lack of authority and a lack of nerve, not a sense of confidence. Bullying and threats are no way to manage a party, but a signal that Labour has lost control, with its crude methods in cutting winter fuel payments and its attempt to cut disability benefits. As MPs head off for the summer next week, Keir Starmer and the Labour whips hope they will be mulling over their futures, having been warned of the severe penalty for disloyalty. But I doubt that’s the message most will absorb.More than 120 MPssignalled their oppositionto the proposed welfare cuts, and many more agreed but didn’t sign the amendment. Was the solution to sack the lot? Or just the token “ringleaders”? In fact there were none, just a strong belief among backbenchers of all varieties that not only were the cuts wrong, they were badly done and would be politically damaging, as indeed they were. Those suspended are of the soft left, by no means Corbynites. Rachael Maskell is a bit of a moral grandstander, annoying other MPs by suggesting her conscience is clearer than theirs, but suspensions tend to play to those tendencies (though the four will find that once they are no longer representing Labour, they will lose their voice with broadcasters).A Labour aide boasted gleefully that these “heads on spikes” were intended as a warning shot to the new intake of MPs not to rebel, but it sounds like petty revenge for their success in forcing the leadership into U-turns. Don’t even think of sacking Diane Abbott again: it didn’t work out well. She would be away in the Lords now had the party not blundered last time, making her dig in her heels very effectively.Starmer is building quite a record for stamping down on dissent. He is the first prime minister tosuspend the whipfrom MPs in his first month in power. In fact, during that first month, when he punished the seven whovoted for an SNP motionto abolish the two-child benefit cap, he suspended more MPs than Tony Blair did during his decade in No 10, despite frequent rebellions. One senior Blair aide said Jeremy Corbyn wasn’t expelled even though “he voted more often against than for the government” (not strictly true, although he did vote against the government more than 400 times). I put that to a senior No 10 source, whose riposte was: “Well, Blair should have done! It would have saved us a lot of years in opposition.” Unlikely. If not Corbyn, it would have been someone else of his ilk.Parties need discipline. How did Blair maintain it sufficiently, without expulsions? A Blair aide said he paid close attention to his backbenchers, holding a daily morning meeting with the chief whips Hilary Armstrong and Jackie Smith, and weekly meetings with a rotating roster of MPs including regular rebels – even Dennis Skinner – to test the contents of his speeches ahead of time.Aides such as parliamentary private secretaries were delegated to nurture various groups of MPs – the women, the union supporters, the religious, the leftists, those with particular political issues or constituency concerns, those in marginals who kept their ears closest to the ground. If Blair disagreed with them, he said so and explained why. “Being listened to matters,” said the aide. But the whips weren’t supine or toothless. “They didn’t threaten but they could make MPs’ lives miserable,” the aide added, with measures such asdenying pairing.Things will get worse when MPs return from summer recess, with the autumn budget, the review of services for children with special educational needs and disabilities and a child poverty strategy that needs to rescind the two-child benefit cap, despite60% of the publicin favour of keeping it, including half of Labour voters.There will be many more opportunities for conflict in the party. The problem is profound. This is not about a handful of usual suspects, but a deep unease about the direction of the government, or whether it even has a direction beyond a random collection of policies. Discipline only works if there is a strong story that defines where a government is heading and why. Too many MPs do not believe Starmer’s story, especially after the U-turns they forced seemed to send Labour in a better, more coherent direction. Here’s an example: it’s brilliant that Starmer announced on Thursday that Labour willlower the voting age to 16, but where’s the more radical constitutional reform?MPs can get arrogant when they forget they owe everything to the party that selected, financed and organised for them. However talented or beloved they think they are, few manage to buck the trend of national swings. But that also makes them more anxious about the success of the national party. Many know they won’t be back after the next election, having won implausible seats by small majorities. The hailstorm of bad economic news in recent days depresses spirits: growth is lower than expected, inflation higher and unemployment up. “Give me lucky generals,” Napoleon is reputed to have said, but Rachel Reeves so far has not been one of them. Opinion polls are dismal, withLabourovertaken alarmingly by Reform UK. The summer holiday may be approaching, but the party’s MPs will go home glum.The way to bring them back in better fettle in September is to sharpen Labour’s purpose, build on the best policies of the first year and stop making others that alienate supporters without gaining new ones. Listen to MPs. Remember Aesop’s fable of the north wind and the sun competing to make a man remove his cloak. The north wind fails when it blows with all its might because the man wraps his cloak tighter around him, but when the sun shines he takes it off in the heat. Persuasion works better than force.Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsKeir StarmerOpinionLabourcommentShareReuse this content"

The tone, as you might expect from a goofball superhero movie that is plainly about the invasion of Gaza, is all over the shop. Too many characters contribute too little to the plot. There are moments when it feels like it was written specifically to provide work for the silly-glasses and ironic-haircut industries. It is a bit of a mess.Puppy power: canine in new Superman movie spurs pet adoption interestRead moreBut that said, one thing is demonstrably true: the dog is cool. As shown in the trailer, Krypto the superdog is Superman’s secret weapon. A mile away from his last screen outing, where he was muscular and proud and voiced by Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, Superman’s Krypto is scrappy and wild. He doesn’t obey commands. He destroys whatever equipment is put in front of him. Whenever he may or may not save the day, it seems like he does it out of accident rather than design.And now everybody wants one. Research by the dog training app Woofz has shown that Google searches for “adopt a dog near me”jumped 513% during Superman’s opening weekend. What’s more, searches for “rescue dog adoption near me” rose by 163%, while “adopt a puppy” rose by 31%. And these searches are specific, too. Krypto is apparently a schnauzer-terrier mix, and “adopt a schnauzer” searches have risen by almost 300% since Superman’s release.There are many potential reasons for this. Perhaps viewers who found themselves confused by Superman’s swampy storytelling latched on to Krypto as a guidepoint. Perhaps they have short attention spans and fail to think things through, as with the boom of dalmatian sales (and subsequent boom in dalmatian abandonments)after 101 Dalmatians was released in 1996. Or perhaps it’s because Superman is one of the rare films to get dog ownership exactly right.View image in fullscreenNot entirely realistic … Marley & Me.Photograph: REX/c.20th Century Fox/EverettSo often in Hollywood, dogs are either loyal companions or would-be therapists who teach their owners about the meaning of love. Think of Marley and Me, in which a dog helps Owen Wilson to love and then dies. Or Turner and Hooch, in which a dog helps Tom Hanks to love and then gets murdered. Or Old Yeller, in which a dog helps a boy to love and then the boy shoots it with a shotgun. Some mix the formula up a little – in The Call of the Wild a dog teaches Harrison Ford to love, and then Harrison Ford dies – but you get the gist.Meanwhile, Krypto is a bit of a dick. The first time we meet him, Superman has been beaten for the very first time. Bleeding and broken, as a last resort he calls on his faithful pup to help him to safety. In any other film, this is exactly what Krypto would have done. But here he leaps all over Superman instead, doing little but compounding his injuries. He’s excited. He wants to help. But he’s also a dog, so he’s sort of useless.Winningly, there’s no sentimental ending to his story, either. He doesn’t ever really bond with Superman, and he definitely doesn’t die. In the end (and this probably counts as a spoiler), Supergirl comes and picks him up, and Superman barely even notices. There’s no growth. Nobody learns anything. It’s sort of great.It’s telling that Krypto was only written into the script after James Gunn adopted a dog of his own, named Ozu. Last year on Twitter, Gunn wrote that “Ozu, who came from a hoarding situation in a backyard with 60 other dogs and never knew human beings, was problematic to say the least. He immediately came in and destroyed our home, our shoes, our furniture – he even ate my laptop. It took a long time before he would even let us touch him. I remember thinking, ‘Gosh, how difficult would life be if Ozu had superpowers?’ – and thus Krypto came into the script.”And maybe that’s the key here. There were no misty-eyed Marley and Me-style reminiscences about Ozu. Gunn was living through the incredibly annoying part of dog ownership where neither party fully trusts the other, and just lifted it wholesale into the script. And this realistic depiction has apparently translated to the hearts of Superman’s audience, as we will soon see when thousands of schnauzers are definitely not abandoned at shelters four months from now.Explore more on these topicsFilmSupermanFamily filmsFamilyPetsDogsAnimalsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

That said, Debrett’s is on hand to advise how much you should “officially” spend. “The average range is between £50 and £100,” says Liz Wyse, Debrett’s etiquette adviser. “If you are a close friend or a family member, you may well choose to spend more. If you have been invited to an evening reception only, you would be expected to spend less, in the region of £25-50.“But of course, much will depend on your social circle, the expectations of your friends and family, and the kind of presents that have been given within your social group. Ultimately, you should never bankrupt yourself or get into debt because you are trying to keep up with a level of present giving that is very elevated and beyond your reach.”Did you receive a cherished gift on your wedding day?

Other countries are already seeing the benefitsChristine HuebnerThey turn out at high rates and are engaged, but don’t expect electoral shocks – they’re as politically diverse as anyoneThu 17 Jul 2025 12.53 EDTLast modified on Thu 17 Jul 2025 13.51 EDTShareThe government has announced it will lower the voting age to 16 for all UK elections in time for the next general election. In 1969, the UK became thefirst major democracy in the worldto lower the voting age from 21 to 18. Few people knew what to expect from this change.Things are different now. In places such as Austria, Argentina and Brazil, as well as parts of Germany and, in the UK, Wales and Scotland, 16- and 17-year-olds are already allowed to vote in some or all elections.We can learn a lot from these places about what happens when 16- and 17-year-olds get the vote. My colleagues and I have spent yearsresearchingthis, and our main finding is simple: nothing bad happens when the voting age is lowered to 16.Including 16- and 17-year-olds in the electorate does not change election outcomes and it does not make elections less representative. Sixteen- and 17-year-olds are just as qualified to vote as other, older voters. Research from Germany and Austria shows that they are able to pick a political party or representative that best represents their views to the same extent as other, slightly older voters.But some things may get better for young people and for democracy overall, especially if young people are taken seriously as voters and receive good education on political issues.Here is what to expect when 16- and 17-year-olds get to vote in the UK general election.Higher turnout among the youngest first-time votersWhen 16- and 17-year-olds get to vote at the next UK election, expect them to turn out in about the same numbers as other voters, and slightly more often than other first-time voters (those aged 18 to 20).In Austria, Latin America, Scotland, Wales and German federal states that lowered the voting age to 16, my colleagues and I consistently find that, when allowed to vote, 16- and 17-year-olds turn out at higher rates than young people who were enfranchised at age 18.We believe this happens because younger people who are in full-time education and often still live at home can make for better,more engagedfirst-time voters compared with 18- to 20-year-olds, who often experience their first election in a highly transitory phase of their lives, while moving out of the parental home, taking up work or further education.No major changes to election outcomesA lower voting age is unlikely to change election outcomes. Sixteen- and 17-year-olds make up between1.5% and less than 5%of the population in constituencies across the UK. They will have a very small impact on vote shares – and only in the most extreme (and improbable) scenario that all 16- and 17-year-olds turned out to vote and decided to vote in thesame way.Those who say that lowering the voting age to 16 is Labour’s move to secure more votes at the next general election might be mistaken. Young people as a group have diverse political attitudes; they do not all vote for the same political parties. In Brazil, young people voted quite similarly to other age groups in the 2022 presidential election and in Austria, where young peoplehave been enfranchised since 2007, the inclusion of 16- and 17-year-olds in the electorate did not change the political landscape.Even for marginal elections, such as Scotland’s 2014 referendum on independence, my colleague Jan Eichhorn from the University of Edinburghshowedthat the inclusion of 16- and 17-year-olds did not change the outcome of the referendum as the youngest first-time voters cast their votes in diverse ways.Political parties and a media that engage with younger votersAny political party can win the support of first-time voters. To do so, political parties have toengage with young peopleand offer attractive policy proposals, asLaura Serra shows.We might also see the media show more younger voters in their reporting. In 2014, BBC Scotlandraised the visibilityof 16- and 17-year-olds by creating a diverse panel of young first-time voters, who provided input into programmes, were panellists on productions on different political topics, and audience members for the final referendum TV debate.Young people who are allowed to vote also influence the adults in their lives. If young people are allowed to participate in elections at 16 and 17, when most are still living at home with their parents, they have the potential to shape political discussions within the family or household. In an ageing society, political parties and a media that engage with younger voters, and dinner-table conversations about political issues and across generations, can be a good outcome.A potentially stronger democracyIn the longer term, including 16- and 17-year-olds in the electorate might make democracy more resilient. InAustriaandLatin America, young people who were enfranchised at 16 or 17 were more satisfied with democracy and democratic institutions – parliament or political parties.The lowering of the voting age might also provide an opportunity to address inequalities in who participates in elections. Across all ages we see stark differences in who turns out to vote and who does not. After the lowering of the voting age in Scotland, however, we found 16- and 17-year-olds to beequally engaged with elections, regardless of their social background.Schools and colleges play a crucial role in compensating for the lack of parents or peers to get young people voting. Good and statutory civic education for all young people makes a big difference for democracy in the long term.Austriahas done well in combining the lowering of the voting age with a big reform of and investment in civic and citizenship education. InScotland, young adults who remembered taking classes in school in which political issues were discussed were more likely to turn out in elections throughout their 20s.Christine Huebner is a lecturer in quantitative social sciences at the University of SheffieldDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

My comments in the interview … were factually correct, as any fair-minded person would accept.”In theinterview with the BBCearlier on Thursday, Abbott, the first black woman elected to parliament, had said: “Clearly, there must be a difference between racism which is about colour and other types of racism because you can see a Traveller or a Jewish person walking down the street, you don’t know.“I just think that it’s silly to try and claim that racism which is about skin colour is the same as other types of racism. I don’t know why people would say that.”The suspension was the latest sign that the prime minister intends to take a tougher approach to party discipline after being forced to U-turn over controversial welfare cuts after a massive rebellion by his MPs.He insisted on Thursday that he will not be “deflected” from his mission to reform Britain after suspending the whip from four Labour MPs who repeatedly voted against the government, including on welfare reform legislation.Starmer said the suspensions of Rachael Maskell, Neil Duncan-Jordan, Brian Leishman and Chris Hinchliff were not just about a single vote but the result of “repeatedly breaking the whip” and undermining Labour’s ability to fulfil its manifesto.At a joint press conference with the German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, he was asked whether punishing the MPs made him look weak.“We are elected in to change this country for the better, and that means we’ve got to carry through that change, and we’ve got to carry through reforms,” he replied.“I’m determined that we will change this country for the better, for millions of working people, and I’m not going to be deflected from that.“And therefore we had to deal with people who repeatedly break the whip, because everyone was elected as a Labour MP on the manifesto of change and everybody needs to deliver as a Labour government. This is about what we’re doing for the country.”Abbott, who has the honorary title mother of the house as the longest-serving female MP in the Commons, first made her comments ina letterto the Observer in 2023 and wassuspended from the partyafter Starmer said they were antisemitic.Abbott wrote that Irish, Jewish and Traveller people “undoubtedly experience prejudice”. “This is similar to racism and the two words are often used as if they are interchangeable,” she said.“It is true that many types of white people with points of difference, such as redheads, can experience this prejudice. But they are not all their lives subject to racism.”She swiftly apologised and withdrew the remarks at the time, and was eventually readmitted, after a protracted investigation, in time to stand in the general election.Labour sources said the decision to once again suspend Abbott, one of the most well-known leftwing figures in the country, was made swiftly, and that this time she was not offered an opportunity to retract her remarks.It unleashed an angry response among sections of the party. The veteran John McDonnell said: “It is extremely bizarre that Diane Abbott gets suspended for an interview in which she forthrightly condemns antisemitism and racism in all its forms whilst no action is taken against those thatinserted into Keir Starmer’s recent speechEnoch Powell’s racist language.”Her longstanding ally Shami Chakrabarti said: “People who are writing‘island of strangers’ speechesshould be a bit slow to sit in judgment on Diane Abbott, who has been fighting racism all her life.”Angela Rayner said she was disappointed that Abbott had defended the comments, saying there was “no place for antisemitism” within Labour.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Rayner said it was “not good” the MP had sought to back away from her earlier apology.A Labour party spokesperson said: “Diane Abbott has been administratively suspended from the Labour party, pending an investigation. We cannot comment further while this investigation is ongoing.”In her BBC interview, Abbott said she felt “a bit weary” of people labelling her antisemitic. She had “spent a lifetime fighting racism of all kinds and in particular fighting antisemitism, partly because of the nature of my constituency”. Her northLondonconstituency of Hackney North and Stoke Newington is home to a large Jewish population.View image in fullscreenDiane Abbott said she had ‘tremendous support locally’ in her constituency when she was suspended the first time, with a ‘big rally on the steps of Hackney town hall’.Photograph: Guy Smallman/Getty ImagesAsked whether she felt she had been “hung out to dry” by the Labour leadership during the disciplinary process relating to her remarks, she said: “In the end, Keir Starmer had to restore the whip to me.“I got tremendous support locally. We had a big rally on the steps of Hackney town hall. And in the end Keir Starmer and the people around him had to back off because of the support I had from the community.”Abbott was readmitted to the party and allowed to stand as a Labour candidate after party officials failed to broker a deal by which she would get the whip back in return for standing down. The row dominated the early days of the general election campaign.The decision to suspend the four other MPs also sparked a backlash from parts of the Labour left. Maskell publicly criticised the move. “On this occasion, I don’t think he’s got it right,” she told the BBC. “There needs to be a better reach-out to backbenchers to ensure that we are the safeguards of our government.”Before her own suspension, Abbott criticised the treatment of backbenchers and called for more space for MPs to raise concerns about policy. Writing on social media, she said: “Silencing dissent is not leadership. It’s control.”A senior Labour figure expressed frustration at what they saw as inconsistent discipline, telling the Guardian: “There were other ministers who helped stir this rebellion – including one who actively encouraged colleagues to sign the amendment. Why are they allowed to carry on?”But Jess Phillips, a Home Office minister, defended the move, saying the MPs involved should not be surprised by the consequences. “There has to be an element of discipline otherwise you end up not being able to govern,” she told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.“Constantly taking to the airwaves and slagging off your own government – I have to say, what did you think was going to happen?”Explore more on these topicsDiane AbbottLabourRaceLondonnewsShareReuse this content"

England reached a sixth consecutive major tournament semi-final with a gut-busting performance to come from two goals down against Sweden before sealing victory via a penalty shootout with goalkeeper Hannah Hampton the hero.Kosovare Asllani’s early strike and Stina Blackstenius’s effort had rattled Sarina Wiegman’s side. It had been all Sweden, England were down and out, headed for the Euros exit, their crown relinquished, but you can never bet against Wiegman in a major tournament and, although many were screaming for changes to come sooner, it was her late cavalry that delivered two goals in 102 seconds to level the score and force the game beyond 90 minutes. England became the first team to come from two goals down in the knockout stages of the women’s Euros since the tournament began in 1984 and Hampton was the superstar, emerging from Mary Earps’ shadow, saving two spot-kicks with Sweden missing three others.Asllani had promised that Sweden had the “perfect gameplan” for facing the team with whom they share many similar characteristics. The first blow was dealt in the second minute and the target of Sweden’s gameplan was clear: attack England’s new look left-hand side. Jess Carter had struggled at left-back against France and was swapped with the left-sided centre-back Alex Greenwood for their remaining two group games. The move had seemed effective but it was compromised by the Swedes.View image in fullscreenHannah Hampton (right) is congratulated by Esme Morgan after the goalkeeper saved two penalties in the shootout.Photograph: Nick Potts/PAUnder pressure, Carter’s pass to Keira Walsh fell short and was intercepted, the second time she had turned over the ball within a minute, and it fell kindly for Blackstenius who squared to Asllani and the midfielder fired low past Hampton into the bottom corner.The yellow wall of fans behind Jennifer Falk’s goal roared while those in white seemed shell-shocked, England’s sloppiness and inability to escape Sweden’s press so untypical of the team that had dispatched the Netherlands and Wales so easily.Carter was exposed again soon after, a loose pass to Hampton pickpocketed by Blackstenius but Leah Williamson raced back to block her club teammate’s effort.Kosovare AsllaniEngland almost had an equaliser against the run of play a minute later, Lauren Hemp denied when Falk tipped her shot on to the crossbar, but any hopes a first effort on goal would calm England were in vain. Wiegman’s side were overrun, outmuscled, outfought and outthought and Sweden’s second seemed inevitable. It arrived in the 25th minute, Blackstenius racing clear of a ponderous Carter before firing low into the far corner. It was too easy, and in an attempt to halt the success of Sweden on their right, Williamson and Carter switched sides.Hampton ensured the deficit remained at two with a big save to deny Fridolina Rolfö shortly before the break and England raced down the tunnel to pick over the bones of an utterly humiliating first half.View image in fullscreenMichelle Agyemang scores England’s second goal to turn the tie on its head.Photograph: Matthew Childs/ReutersThere was surprise that there were no changes at the break for England, the determination to continue with a clearly struggling Carter was baffling, particularly when the far more agile Manchester United captain Maya Le Tissier, Washington Spirit’s Esme Morgan and the Arsenal centre-back Lotte Wubben-Moy were on the bench. You could argue that Carter improved, but the reality is that Sweden took their foot off the gas, their press loosened as they allowed England more time on the ball.The defending champions were better after the restart. Ella Toone forced a save from Falk before Hemp flashed a header wide, but they just could not get the ball down the right. Bronze had her arms raised for much of the first half and cut an isolated figure on that flank, despite many having identified the left-back Jonna Andersson as the weak link for the Swedes in the buildup.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Michelle Agyemang, Beth Mead and Morgan would be tasked with rescuing England, Toone and Stanway replaced along with Carter.It was chaos from them on until the close, the kitchen sink thrown in by Wiegman, with the entire midfield eventually removed as they fought to get into the game and then go for the win.Wiegman’s charges prodded at the Sweden defence and they finally pierced it in the 79th minute, Bronze drifting past everyone at the far post to meet substitute Chloe Kelly’s cross and head past Falk. It was a lifeline and there was less than two minutes between Bronze’s goal and the equaliser, Kelly’s cross nodded down by Mead and turned in by Agyemang. They should have grabbed the winner, Alessia Russo taking one touch too many after she had just the keeper to beat in virtually the last serious attack before extra time.If England had the marginally fresher legs on the pitch, it did not show in extra time, the game far more even than Wiegman would have liked. There were some issues too, Williamson rolled her ankle forcing her to limp off at the midway point of extra time, James also felt the full force of a Lina Hurtig challenge and a three-way clash between Greenwood, Hampton and a Swede left the keeper with a nosebleed and the former with her shoulder being repositioned while Bronze taped her own thigh up.There was not much more action and a shootout was confirmed soon after. Julia Zigiotti Olme and Nathalie Björn scored for Sweden but Russo, Kelly and Bronze converted for England and Hampton saved from Filippa Angeldahl and Sofia Jakobsson while Magda Eriksson hit the post. Smilla Holmberg and Falk, who had saved from James, Clinton and Greenwood efforts, fired over, to send England through in the most dramatic of fashions.

It also reported theBBC for broadcasting the set. Bob Vylan have subsequently had severalscheduled appearances cancelledafterUKLFI sent letters.Mo Chara of Kneecapwas charged with a terrorism offence, accused of displaying a flag at a gig in support of the banned organisation Hezbollah after being reported to the police by UKLFI. Kneecap alsohad gigs cancelledafter interventions by UKLFI.While those actions were made public, UKLFI is also believed to have contacted other musicians, people and organisations connected with them without publicising the fact.The post shared by Eno and others on Instagram says: “The scenes in Gaza have moved beyond description. We write as artists who’ve chosen to use our public platforms to speak out against the genocide occurring there and the role of the UK government in facilitating it.“We’re aware of the scale of aggressive, vexatious campaigns operated by UKLFI and of multiple individual incidences of intimidation within the music industry itself, designed solely to censor and silence artists from speaking their hearts and minds.“Having withstood these campaigns of attempted censorship, we won’t stand by and allow other artists – particularly those at earlier stages of their careers or in other positions of professional vulnerability – to be threatened into silence or career cancellation.”They encourage other artists to contact them to make a collective stand on demands including an immediate and permanent ceasefire, immediate unfettered access to Gaza for recognised aid agencies and an end to UK arms sales and licences to Israel.In a statement provided to the Guardian, Massive Attack said: “This collective action is really about offering some kind of solidarity to those artists who are living day after day in a screen-time genocide, but are worried about using their platforms to express their horror at that because of the level of censorship within their industry or from highly organised external legal bodies, terrifying them and their management teams with aggressive legal actions. The intention is clear and obvious: to silence them.”The Instagram post highlights a new documentary film about UKLFIprojected by Led by Donkeys on Thursday night.A spokesperson for UKLFI said a Massive Attack show last month had prompted complaints by Jewish and Israeli audience members because it included comparison of Israel’s actions with the Holocaust and, separately, images were shown of the former Hamas leader, Yahya Sinwar (which Massive Attack said was part of a digital collage that should not be isolated and taken out of context).They added: “We wrote to Massive Attack to convey this, and requested that future performances do not repeat these actions. We believe in free speech and artistic expression, however we felt this performance crossed a line and made audience members feel deeply traumatised.”Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

Personal information aboutMI6officers was also included.The identities of members of the SAS and MI6 are a closely guarded secret, and the possibility that such information could have ended up in the public domain was a source of significant official concern.SAS and other special forces officers were involved in assessing whether Afghans who said they were members of the elite 333 and 444 units, known as the Triples, were allowed to come to the UK.​Defence sources said the dataset also referred to a “secret route” that Afghans could use to come to the UK.This week it emerged that the Ministry of Defence had obtained a superinjunction preventing the disclosure of the leak and that a £2bn-plus scheme had been created to relocate some Afghans affected by the breach to the UK to protect them from the Taliban.That superinjunction lapsed on Tuesday, when a high court judge, Mr Justice Chamberlain, concluded after a government review that the threat to the 18,700 Afghans was no longer very significant.Some of the remaining restrictions were relaxed on Thursday after another court hearing. The MoD said it would be possible to publish additional descriptions about contents of the database.In a statement on Tuesday, after theunprecedented superinjunctionwas lifted, the defence secretary, John Healey, offered a “sincere apology” on behalf of the government for the data breach.He later told the Commons that the spreadsheet contained “names and contact details of applicants and, in some instances, information relating to applicants’ family members, and in a small number of cases the names of members of parliament, senior military officers and government officials were noted as supporting the application”.“This was a serious departmental error,” he added.Parliament’s intelligence and security committee (ISC), which monitors the UK spy agencies, said it would scrutinise the affair, following on from an inquiry announced by the Commons defence select committee.The ISC asked that all intelligence assessments that had been shared with high court in secret now be shared with the committee. Its chair, Lord Beamish, asked why “material relating to the data loss” could not be shared with the committee early given that it routinely reviews classified material.The MoD welcomed the proposed review. “Defence intelligence and the wider department have been instructed by the defence secretary to give their full support to the ISC and all parliamentary committees,” a spokesperson said.The decision to seek an injunction preventing the disclosure of the data breach was first taken by Ben Wallace, then the Conservative defence secretary, in August 2023, when the MoD first became aware that the personal information had leaked to a Facebook group.A judge then ordered that the injunction remain secret, turning it into a rarely used superinjunction. Wallace’s immediate successor, Grant Shapps, sought to maintain the gagging order until the general election in July 2024 while developing a secret relocation scheme for about 15,000 Afghans affected.The day-to-day task for developing the scheme was handed to one of Shapps’s deputies, James Heappey, the then minister for the armed forces. On Thursday, in a social media posting, Heappey said the scheme was discussed in the cabinet’s domestic an economic affairs committee.He said the committee “tried to extend entitlements by smallest number possible”, as led by legal advice, with little resistance from other members of the government. “I don’t recall fierce opposition. There was frustrated resignation that it was necessary,” he said.It can now be reported that the ​leaked data included the names, ​email addresses and phone numbers for thousands of Afghans​ who had applied to come to the UK under an existing relocation scheme designed for those who had helped the British military.In some instances the data contained further written information about their case and status of their application – focused on whether they had in fact helped the UK or British forces inAfghanistan– but it did not contain addresses​ or photographs.This week Afghans affected by the breach received a message addressed from the UK government, sent in English, Pashto and Dari, that warned the recipient’s email address had been used to make a resettlement application and that some personal data may have been compromised.Details of the breach were limited, but recipients of the email – some of whom remain in hiding from the Taliban in Afghanistan – were advised “not to take phone calls or respond to messages or emails from unknown contacts” and to limit who could see their social media profiles.Explore more on these topicsDefence policyEspionageMI6MilitaryAfghanistanImmigration and asylumUK security and counter-terrorismnewsShareReuse this content"

Hadush Gerberslasie Kebatu, 38, from Ethiopia, who denies the offences, was remanded in custody before a two-day trial next month at Chelmsford magistrates court.An antiracism demonstration took place near the town’s railway station on Thursday and hundreds of people later congregated outside the hotel, with a flat-bed trailer on a lorry bearing a banner that read: “Protect our kids”. Those present included activists wearing T-shirts of the Britain First party. Far-right activists, who have a significant local presence, were central to the protest on Sunday and have been vocal on community Facebook groups.0:17Security guard assaulted as protest takes place outside hotel housing asylum seekers – videoTwo local Conservative MPs called on Labour to immediately close the hotel and another in Epping, which have been used to house asylum seekers. The situation had become “increasingly alarming and distressing in recent days”, said Neil Hudson and Alex Burghart.Weyman Bennett, co-convenor of Stand Up To Racism, who was part of the counter-protest, said that a peaceful demonstration made up of local and trade unions had been attacked by groups led by the far right.“It is important to stand up against division; otherwise, we will witness a pogrom-type movement,” he added.The flare-up comes ahead of the first anniversary of last summer’s riots, which began after the murders of three young girls in Southport and resulted in attempts to burn down hotels housing asylum seekers.The chief executive of the Refugee Council, Enver Solomon, said there was a need to speed up plans to end the use of asylum hotels, which he said had become a “flashpoint for tension in communities, cost billions to the taxpayer, and leave people trapped in limbo”.Security fencing went up around the hotel on Wednesday. A man who said he was an asylum seeker from Libya told the Guardian that he and others still felt safe. “We are being treated well and we just want our cases to be heard,” he added. “There is no trouble.”A local resident said that while they and others in the community had concerns, it was also the case that outside elements and local activists had been trying to inflame the situation.“Most people would rather it was not there, that it was back as a hotel, but it is what it is and maybe there’s a case for new arrivals to be kept somewhere more secure and be checked.”Ch Supt Simon Anslow said:“People protesting peacefully, lawfully and responsibly cause us – and the wider public – no concern. However, we can never and will never tolerate criminal violence of any sort and anyone identified as committing crime will be dealt with robustly.”A Home Office spokesperson said the government had already taken action to ban foreign nationals who commit sexual offences from being granted asylum.“The right to protest is fundamental to our democracy, but this cannot cross the line into unlawful or violent behaviour. We continue to work closely with Essex police,” she added.Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

Others were treated at the scene.The coach overturned on its roof and slid 6 metres (20ft) down an embankment. An off-duty firefighter was following the coach and began helping the children and adults from the vehicle. Some of the passengers were trapped in the coach and had to be freed by firefighters.Many of the children who did not need hospital treatment spent around five hours at a makeshift rest centre before being ferried back to Minehead middle school where parents gathered to pick them up.Ch Supt Mark Edgington of Avon and Somerset police said: “Shortly before 3pm this afternoon, emergency services were called to a collision involving a coach on the A396 at Cutcombe Hill, in Exmoor.“Approximately 60 to 70 people were believed to be onboard. A major incident was declared, with police, fire and ambulance services dispatching crews to the scene.“A number of other people have presented or been taken to hospital, some of them with serious injuries. This includes two children who were taken to hospital by air ambulance. An investigation into the cause of the incident will be carried out.”He asked people not to speculate on the cause of the crash, saying it would add to the distress of “the families, staff and the driver”.The prime minister said he is being kept up to date and thanked emergency workers. In a post on X, Keir Starmer said there were “no adequate words to acknowledge the death of a child. All my thoughts are with their parents, family and friends, and all those affected.”Wayne Darch, deputy director of operations at South Western ambulance service, said it sent 46 resources to the scene. He said the child, who has not been named, died at the scene.Gavin Ellis, the chief fire officer for Devon and Somerset fire and rescue service, said it sent 60 personnel. “Our crews carried out a number of extrications and rescues in extremely difficult circumstances,” he said.The area the crash happened in is heavily wooded and the embankment the coach went down steep.Ellis said: “This was a very complex and technically difficult operation. I’m grateful to the off-duty firefighter who was travelling behind the coach at the point of the crash who was able to start making immediate effect to release those casualties from the bus.”The coach company Ridlers said one of its 70-seat vehicles was involved.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She told the Associated Press thatEswatiniplanned to ultimately repatriate the five to their home countries with the help of a UN agency.Mdluli said it wasn’t clear how long that would take.US border czar says he doesn’t know fate of eight men deported to South SudanRead moreThe International Organisation for Migration (IOM) – the UN agency tasked with ensuring migration is managed in a way that respects human rights – said on Thursday it was not involved in the removal of the migrants from the US and has not been contacted to help send them back home.“As always, IOM stands ready to support Member States, upon request and where operationally feasible, in line with its humanitarian mandate,” an official from the organisation told Reuters.The men,who the US says were convicted of serious crimesand were in the US illegally, are citizens of Vietnam, Jamaica, Cuba, Yemen and Laos. Their convictions included murder and child rape, according to the US Department of Homeland Security said.US officials also said the men’s home countries would not take them back.Local media reported the men are being held at the Matsapha Correctional Complex, outside the country’s administrative capital of Mbabane, which includes Eswatini’s top maximum-security prison.Their deportations were announced by the department on Tuesday and mark the continuation of president Donald Trump’s plan to send deportees to third countries they have no ties with after it wasstalled by a legal challenge in the US.The US state department’s most recenthuman rights reporton Eswatini – an absolute monarchy – pointed to “credible reports of: arbitrary or unlawful killings, including extrajudicial killings; torture and cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment by the government”.There were credible reports that some political prisoners were tortured in detention, according to the state department. Prison conditions overall varied, though facilities were plagued with overcrowding, disrepair, poor nutrition and ventilation and unchecked prisoner-on-prisoner violence.TheTrump administrationhas been seeking to make deals with countries across the globe to accept immigrants that the US cannot easily deport to their home countries.Though other administrations have conducted third-country removals, the Trump administration’s practice of sending immigrants to countries facing political and human rights crises have raised international alarm and condemnation.US completes deportation of eight men to South Sudan after legal wranglingRead moreEarlier this month the US completeddeportation of eight otherimmigrants to South Sudan – a country beset with political instability and a hunger crisis. Prior to landing in South Sudan, the deportees were diverted to a US military based base in Djibouti, where they had beenheld in a converted shipping containerfor weeks. More than 200 Venezuelan men that the Trump administration deported to El Salvador –most of whomhad no criminal histories in the US – also remain incarcerated in the country’s notorious mega-prison Cecot, where detainees have reported facing torture.There have been no details on why Eswatini agreed to take the men, and Mdluli, the government spokesperson, said “the terms of the agreement between the US and Eswatini remain classified”.Eswatini has said it was the result of months of negotiations between the two governments. South Sudan has also given no details of its agreement with the US to take deportees and has declined to say where the eight men sent there are being held.Last week Tom Homan, the US border tsar, said hedid not know what has happenedto the eight men deported to South Sudan.With the Associated Press and ReutersExplore more on these topicsUS immigrationEswatiniUS politicsTrump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

Bilateral lower extremity venous Doppler ultrasounds were performed and revealed chronic venous insufficiency, a benign and common condition, particularly in individuals over the age of 70,” the memo said.It is a fairly common condition among older adults, but requires a thorough checkup to rule out more serious causes of swelling in the legs. Here are some things to know.Chronic venous insufficiency, or CVI, happens when veins in the legs cannot properly carry blood back to the heart. That can lead to blood pooling in the lower legs. In addition to swelling, usually around the feet and ankles, symptoms can include legs that are achy, heavy-feeling or tingly, and varicose veins. Severe cases could trigger leg sores known as ulcers.Overcoming gravity to pump blood from the feet all the way up to the heart is a challenge, especially when someone is standing or sitting for long periods. So legs veins are lined with one-way valves that keep blood from sliding backward on that journey. Anything that damages those valves can lead to chronic venous insufficiency. Risk factors can include blood clots, vein inflammation known as phlebitis or being overweight.Doctors must rule out serious causes of leg swelling, such as heart problems, kidney disease or blood clots. Ultrasound exams of the leg veins can help confirm chronic venous insufficiency. According to the Cleveland Clinic, treatment can include wearing compression stockings, elevating the legs and achieving a healthy weight. Also exercise, especially walking, is recommended – because strong leg muscles can squeeze veins in a way that helps them pump blood. Medications and medical procedures are available for more advanced cases.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpHealthexplainersShareReuse this content"

I had resolved to not have children of my own but when I met my partner, with whom I have a wonderful relationship, he came with two children from a previous marriage. He’s very supportive and understanding in giving me my space from the children when I need it, and he’s come to respect the fact I am making concessions in my life to take on parenting.I love both the children but the youngest is a challenge. She presents a lot of the characteristics of her mother – she has no shame, no accountability, zero fear of authority and is incrediblyspoilt. My partner struggles with this too. I know she’s five and you can’t expect someone so young to be accountable, but I’m really worriedshe won’t grow out of it.I don’t want to create a self-fulfilling prophecy in which she senses me distancing myself and that rejection makes matters worse, but at the same time I am feeling resentful. I’m resistant to tolerating her when I never asked for her to be in my life in the first place. Is it wrong to be wary of such a small child?I’ve been in a sexless marriage for 35 years. What can I do? | Leading questionsRead moreEleanor says:Am I a bad person for feeling this way, that’s the question? Is there a world where I say, “yes”? Of course not.Here’s your permission: it’s fine to feel mixed. It’s fine to have not wanted kids. It’s fine to feel complicated about their presence in your life now, or complicated about their mother. It’s fine to feel frustrated by a particular child’s behaviour. It’s fine to resent the way stepmothers can get a raw deal, culturally – easily villainised, expected to handle the same challenges as biological parents, without the same decision-privileges.All this is fine to struggle with.What might not be fine is what we choose to do, given those feelings.You said you’re resistant to tolerating your stepdaughter when you never asked for her to be in your life in the first place. True, you didn’t ask. But you were asked, and you said yes. You don’t have to have a relationship with someone who has kids. You don’t have to say yes to having a kid in your house, your time, your life.To be totally clear: having said yesdoes not meanyou can’t feel resentful sometimes. It doesn’t even mean you have to keep saying yes. Heaven knows we all agree to things we’re not thrilled with for the sake of our relationship: moving country, changing jobs, caring for their relatives. But it gets sticky if, once the bad bits show up, we reserve the right to be treated as someone who didn’t sign up for this.Some decisions don’t work like that. Especially with little kids. Your concern about this is totally right; you can really mess up a kid if ambivalence about your decision to be in their life becomes ambivalence in how you treat them. It’s fine to not want a certain relationship with a child. What’s not fine is agreeing to a relationship you don’t really want, and then letting the child see that asterisk. That’s true for biological parents, step-parents, foster parents.So perhaps instead of asking whether you’re a bad person for having these feelings, you could ask what you’ll say “yes” to from here on.Some step-parents want to be aparent,no modifications. Others want to be more clearly delineated as a parent’s partner. Counselling with her father would be a really good investment to make sure youbothagree about which version of step-parenting you’re trying to build.I’m estranged from my parents. How do I explain this to my child? | Leading questionsRead moreIf you do decide to continue to be part of his life, he is a package deal. So then, the goal becomes how to process and move past these feelings, not to privately stand by their legitimacy. It might help to learn about psychology and development in five-year-olds. That may help you understand difficult behaviour, and how it may come from difficulties she’s experiencing. Counselling for you, privately, could also remind everyone involved that your role is a hard one; that you deserve time and help to figure it out.It is OK to find this incredibly frustrating. But you want to be careful about saying yes to a certain version of life while still maintaining the backstop that it is not the life you wanted.Ask Eleanor a questionExplore more on these topicsFamilyLeading questionsParents and parentingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But what made the 19-year-old Francis’s version click was the way in which she took pleasure in her ex’s misery, coolly and coyly cooing over the slow-rocking backing while picking his failed love life apart; for a finale, she ended the song with impressive, high-kicking spite. In contrast, her second UK No 1 was the daffy Stupid Cupid, written by Neil Sedaka and Howard Greenfield, and loaded with ear-catching gimmicks: the bow-and-arrow guitar effect on the chorus; Francis jumping an octave when she sings “Cu-pid!”; and instruments that drop out – the musical equivalent of a wink – to allow her voice to sound as seductive as possible.Her career would follow this pattern through the late 50s and early 60s, alternating lightly updated pre-rock ballads with teenage material redolent of soda shops and drive-ins, the kind of American 50s scenario later lit in neon by Happy Days and Grease. Of the ballads, My Happiness and Mama were especially heartfelt performances, and both reached the top 10 in Britain and America, while the desperation of the country-leaning My Heart Has a Mind of Its Own gave her the second of three US No 1s. The finger-snapping Fallin’ and It’s Gonna Take Some Time were cool and sassy, while Lipstick on Your Collar (its title later used by Dennis Potter as a late 50s signifier) and Vacation were so camp, they were almost gleeful self-parodies.In 1960, Francis made her big-screen debut in Where the Boys Are, and the Sedaka/Greenfield theme song became another transatlantic top five single. 1960 was also the year Brenda Lee broke through – up to this point, Francis had been a lone trailblazer for women in rock’n’roll; the likes of Wanda Jackson and Jo Ann Campbell made great records but never came close to a top 10 hit, while the girl group era which gave us the Ronettes, the Chiffons and the Shangri-Las didn’t begin in earnest until 1962.Francis struggled to adapt to the rise of the teenage girl group, though when she recorded material as strong as 1965’s soulful No Better Off it was clear the fault didn’t lie with the singer. She would be edged further into easy listening territory, scoring her last two hits in the UK with the darkly intense My Child in 1965 (she would never have children of her own) and the accusatory Jealous Heart in 1966. The latter could have been directed at her father, also her manager, who had broken up her relationship with the singer Bobby Darin by waving a gun at him; Francis would later describe Darin as “the most interesting human being I’ve ever met in my life”.The following decades were less than kind to Connie Francis, who seemed to be dogged by tragedy. She was raped at knifepoint and almost killed in her motel room in 1974, after performing at a fair in New York state. She went public with the story, and Howard Johnson Motor Lodges were ordered to pay her $2.5m in compensation (later reduced to $1.475m in a settlement); this would then become a test case, leading to major upgrades in American hotel and motel security. The attacker was never found. Francis’s bravery in going public couldn’t help her overcome the mental health repercussions, and she didn’t sing in public for several years afterward. Then in 1981, her brother was shot dead, apparently by a professional hitman; the trauma would lead to Francis being misdiagnosed with manic-depressive disorder. She was involuntarily hospitalized by her controlling father, and spent much of the 1980s in and out of psychiatric institutions. Again, Francis was brave enough to speak out as a survivor, and became a spokesperson for Mental Health America to help others “suffering from the deleterious effects of depression and trauma of all kinds”.Though the hits had dried up in the mid-60s Connie Francis kept a devoted following. In 1977, 20 All Time Greats made her – rather shockingly – the first female solo artist to have a No 1 album in Britain. She had also been the first female singer of the modern pop era to score three US No 1 singles, while 1962’s Pretty Little Baby – only an album track at the time – would become a TikTok hit, gaining millions of streams in 2025 thanks to its use by Kylie Jenner and Kim Kardashian. Connie Francis was a trailblazer, both as a pop star and an advocate of mental health support, and – like most trailblazers – she had to face the highs and the lows on her own.Explore more on these topicsPop and rockfeaturesShareReuse this content"

And that’s just the tip of the dirtbergEmine SanerThu 17 Jul 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 17 Jul 2025 09.10 EDTShareMost everyday objects are at least a little bit grimy. They rarely, if ever, make contact with soap or disinfectant – unlike your toilet seat, even though that’s the one that’s often used as a symbol of filth in studies of household cleanliness. Aside from pathogens that can cause disease and illness, “for the most part, we’re dealing with our own bacteria”, says Jason Tetro, microbiologist and author of The Germ Code. This usually isn’t a problem, especially for youngish healthy people – but, Tetro adds, “when they accumulate, even if they are your own, it can lead to things like skin irritability, itchy scalp, cavities [in teeth from bacteria-heavy toothbrushes], that type of thing”.Does it matter that your reusable shopping bag might be carrying faecal bugs? Or that your watch strap is teeming with lifeforms? Are the studies – usually small, and sometimes conducted by cleaning-product companies – scaremongering or a grave matter of public health? Germ experts come clean.Your tapsAfter going to the loo, or every time your hands are dirty, you touch the tap before washing them. “If you don’t have those [long lever] elbow taps like they have in hospitals, then you’re going to be making your taps really gunky, and lead to the potential for cross-contamination,” says Tetro.Clean bathroom and kitchen taps regularly. In the kitchen, if you’re washing your hands after handling raw meat, consider turning the tap on before you start. “I would suggest you just keep a little stream going, and then you don’t have to touch the taps until you’ve washed your hands properly.” Admittedly, this is wasteful, so you could also make sure you disinfect your kitchen taps afterwards.Kitchen spongesView image in fullscreenSponges can contain harmful bacteria such as salmonella.Photograph: John Kevin/Getty Images/iStockphoto“I’m surprised new lifeforms don’t evolve in kitchen sponges,” saysChuck Gerba, professor of virology at the University of Arizona. They are prime habitats for microbes.“They are always wet,” saysMarkus Egert, professor of microbiology at Hochschule Furtwangen University in Germany. “They have a huge inner surface where a lot of microbes can grow, and you clean a lot of different stuff with them, so the microbes have a lot of nutrients to feed on. And they are rarely cleaned, so that makes them perfect. That’s why there are so many microbes in it within a very short time, billions of microbes. The concentration – not the type of microbes – is similar to a human stool sample.” Studies have shown that sponges can contain harmful bacteria such as salmonella orcampylobacter, which can cause severe food poisoning. For elderly people or young children, or those with a weakened immune system, this can be especially dangerous.Hay fever making your life a misery? Try these 20 tips from doctors and allergy expertsRead moreIf you do use one, you could clean it in the microwave. Wet it thoroughly, put a bit of washing-up liquid on it and microwave it for one minute, and then let it dry out well. “This reduces the number of germs very significantly,” says Egert. But this could eventually prove counterproductive. “The few microbes that survive probably can grow up very fast and so recolonise the sponge. If you do this several times, our hypothesis is that you select for more pathogenic, more resistant microbes than you had before. So you shouldn’t do it too often.” Or preferably don’t use one at all – most sponges are made of plastic and aren’t biodegradable.Cutting boardsOne of the most neglected items in the kitchen, says Gerba, is the cutting board. “People just rinse it off,” he says, “or they’ll cut raw meats and then they’ll make a salad on it, and you have all those cuts and crevices from cutting that make it difficult to clean. Probably the most important thing is putting it in a dishwasher, or rinsing and scrubbing it.”ToothbrushesView image in fullscreenIt’s best to clean your toothbrush daily and replace it after a month.Photograph: FG Trade/Getty Images“A toothbrush is going to be mainly oral bacteria,” says Tetro. Some studies have shown a toothbrush can be home to 10m bacteria. “But the microbiome in your mouth will change over time. If you have a lot of sugary, fatty foods, it may help change your microbiome towards bugs that are not so great, and they’ll become even more populous, and then you’re just spreading them in your mouth.”Give your toothbrush a clean every day. “Run very hot water over the brush and underneath for five seconds. You should also be changing your toothbrush about once a month.” Watch out for your toothbrush holder, too, where gunk accumulates. “All the bacteria in the toothbrush end up growing in the bottom,” says Tetro.HairbrushesTetro is suspicious of anything named “brush” that is never cleaned. “With a hairbrush, it’s going to be yeast and fungi. After you’ve washed your hair, using a [dirty] hairbrush may transfer it into your hair.” This could lead to dandruff, or scalp infections. It should be enough to clean your hairbrush once a month, says Tetro.You love the outdoors. So why are you pooping all over it?Read moreWater bottlesSometimes dark, always moist, with water left for hours, warming up. Add to that oral bacteria, food particles and (if you’re not a regular handwasher) possibly faecal bacteria, and your water bottle becomes a banquet for germs. If you fill your bottle with protein shakes or sugary drinks, it’s more like an all-you-can-eat for bacteria. Onestudyfound 20% of water bottles tested contained coliform bacteria (of faecal origin).Another studyfound an average water bottle had 20.8m colony-forming units – more than 40,000 times the number on a toilet seat.“If you drink water from a swimming pool, you should expect to drink poop – but, if it’s your own water bottle, probably not,” says Tetro.It’s best to pour away old water, wash the bottle in hot water and washing-up liquid and, at least once a week, give it a good scrub with a (clean!) brush. Don’t forget lids, straws and spouts.Watch strapsYour fancy smartwatch is telling you everything you need to know about your resting heart rate and sleep quality, but it is harbouring a dirty secret – it’s teeming with germs. A2023 studyfound that, while staphylococci were expected (they’re naturally found on skin), there were relatively high rates of pseudonomas bacteria (some variants can cause infections in humans) and 60% had enteric bacteria (found in the intestine), including E coli. Rubber and cloth straps were the worst, with gold and silver straps performing well.EarphonesView image in fullscreenThe music may be relaxing but beware the germs swarming in your ears.Photograph: Luis Alvarez/Getty ImagesYou handle them multiple times, drop them on the floor, put them in your pocket, share them with other people, and then jam them in your ears – a warm, dark, moist place, home to your usual bacterial flora, and now the venue for a whole host of germs to party to your playlist.One studythat swabbed 50 earphones identified fungi and bacteria, including E coli.GlassesAgain, anything that comes into contact with human skin is expected to be loaded with bacteria, anda studyon spectacles found, unsurprisingly, that nose pads and the parts that touched the ears had higher concentrations. While the bacteria detected wouldn’t be a concern to healthy people, the study found about 60% of the bacteria could be risky to people with compromised immune systems. It also identified bacteria linked to eye infections. It found alcohol wipes were the best at decreasing bacterial load, but many opticians say they could damage the lenses and advise warm soapy water and a soft cloth.Spice jarsView image in fullscreenSpice jars are frequently contaminated.Photograph: Johner Images/Getty Images/Johner RFA 2023 food-handling study, following people who were making turkey burgers from raw meat, swabbed utensils and kitchen surfaces afterwards and found spice jars were the most frequently contaminated, with nearly half of the objects affected. Your salt and pepper shakers may also be giving you more than seasoning – a 2010study by ABCNews found shakers in restaurants were the second-dirtiest items on the table (after menus), and in a2008 University of Virginia study, which tested objects that had been touched by cold sufferers, traces of the virus were found on all the shakers.Reusable shopping bags“Reusable bags tend to get contaminated with bacteria from raw meat and produce,” says Gerba. “Putting them in a car trunk is like creating an incubator for the bacteria to grow in most climates.” Inone of his studieswhere reusable grocery bags were collected from shoppers and tested, more than half contained coliform bacteria, which probably came from raw meat and other produce, and E coli was detected in 8% of bags. When the team deliberately contaminated bags with meat juices and stored them in the boot of a car for a couple of hours, the bacteria increased tenfold.“They should be washed on a regular basis,” says Gerba. He favours cotton bags.Light switchesView image in fullscreenLight switches harbour faecal bacteria and the cold virus, according to research.Photograph: mrs/Getty ImagesAteam from the University of Houstontested light switches, among other areas including bathroom sinks and floors, in hotel rooms and found they were significant harbourers of faecal bacteria. Inanother test, nearly a quarter of light switches were found to be contaminated with the cold virus an hour after someone with snotty fingers had touched them.Remote controlsYour TV remote might be 15 times more disgusting than your toilet seat. Asurvey for Churchill, the insurance company, found high levels of faecal bacteria on the remotes swabbed. Other surveys have found that between a quarter and third of people never clean their remote, a device that is touched by an average family of four an estimated 21,000 times a year.Shower curtainsTrue, it’s not as if you’ll come out of the shower dirtier than you went in, but the curtain may be the dirtiest place in the bathroom. To use our trusty toilet-seat comparison tool, one study found shower curtains had 60 times more bacterial life. That was a laughably small study of three curtains, but it’s obvious they’re a danger zone – people have disgusting shower habits, such as urinating, and bacteria thrive in warm, wet places. So does mould.“Shower curtains are disgusting,” says Tetro with a laugh. “This is, again, one of those things where, if it’s your shower, your curtain, who cares, right? But a lot of people will share the shower space. As a result, you are going to have a lot more of those human germs.” And not just from people’s hands and faces, he points out. “It’s going to be coming from your whole body, which is why we really should be disinfecting those shower curtains every time we disinfect the tub or the shower stall.” You can also run the shower curtain through the washing machine every so often.Vacuum cleanersView image in fullscreenAs vacuum cleaners may contain salmonella, it’s best to shake the bag into an outside bin.Photograph: Drazen Zigic/Getty ImagesYou should be mindful of how clean any of your cleaning appliances are, from mouldy washing machines to stinky dishwashers. “You should be careful when you empty the vacuum cleaner,” says Gerba. In samples of household vacuum cleaner contents, “we found salmonella in about 10% of them. What you do is you pick up the bacteria and all this nice food for them to eat [in dust and debris], so it becomes a cafeteria for bacteria.” With a bagless cleaner, don’t shake it into your bin in the kitchen – do it outside if you can).Explore more on these topicsHygieneHealthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

What’s so frustrating is that this really matters right nowStuart HeritageThu 17 Jul 2025 17.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 17 Jul 2025 17.01 EDTShareIt’s never a particularly encouraging sign when the title of a documentary ends with a question mark. It might just be a tiny scrap of punctuation, and yet it can single-handedly undermine an entire thesis.Take the latest episode ofDispatches. A film called Trump: Moscow’s Man in the White House would hit like a juggernaut. That film would be an authoritative, definitive hammer blow, confirming beyond doubt what many have suspected for years: that Donald Trump is either working with or an unwitting puppet of Putin’s Russia. This film would represent a clean punch landed. It would reverberate around the world.And yet what we are given is a film called Trump: Moscow’s Man in the White House? Immediately, the question mark renders the whole thing unappealing. There will be no clean punches here, no definitive proof of anything. You will end the hour with minimal new information, and your mind will remain profoundly unchanged. In other words, what a weird shrug of a show this is.The film begins with a whistle-stop tour of everything you’ve known about for the best part of a decade. The Kremlin collecting information on Trump during his marriage to his Czech Republic-born first wife Ivana. Numerous Russians investing in Trump’s property portfolio as his other businesses failed. The 2016 election interference. Steele. Mueller. Helsinki. Zelenskyy. It would have been a muscular first act that set the stage for a cunning development – some vital new evidence that ties everything together or at the very least moves the story on – except as the film wears on, you realise with a horrible lurch that this isn’t the first act. It’s the whole thing.And it’s hard to see this as anything but a failure; something akin to reading a Twitter thread in 2018. Which isn’t to say the film lacks access. John Bolton is interviewed. Former CIA counterintelligence head Susan Miller is interviewed. We meetFBI agent turned whistleblower Johnathan Buma. And yet none of them can answer the episode’s central question. Bolton says people told him that Trump worked for the Russians, but he was disinclined to believe it. Miller carefully lays out the extremely vague CIA definition of a Russian asset, only to hedge by suggesting that Trump “could be” one, which is no help to anybody.What’s so frustrating is that this really matters. As Russia’s invasion of Ukraine rumbles on, and Trump’s level of involvement seems to oscillate by the minute, this is absolutely the time to cast fresh eyes on his relationship with Putin. And yet, bizarrely, Ukraine comes off as an afterthought. It’s used cynically as a bookend, dropped in at the very beginning and the very end to try and hypnotise the viewer into believing they’ve watched something more timely than they actually have.More focus on the present day would have improved things immeasurably. Early on we met Nathaniel Raymond, who was part of the US State Department Conflict Observatory Program, which worked to record war crimes committed by Russia. His testimony is nothing short of staggering. His investigation led him to estimate that 35,000 Ukrainian children – some as young as eight months old – have beensystematically abducted and reeducated by Russian forces, in what amounts to industrialised kidnapping. Real progress was being made in tracking them. But then Trump was reelected, and almost instantly cut the program’s funding.The segment is a ghost of what the film could have been – an up-to-the-minute exploration of howDoge cutbackshave redefined the connections between Trump and Putin – but instead, gallingly, we are taken by the hand and led towards yet more hoary old speculation about theMiss Universe pee-pee tapes.Perhaps the film-makers know they’re doomed to be outpaced by current events and have simply resigned themselves to it. This week alone there seems to have been a shift inthe way Trump deals with Russia, supplying Ukraine with missiles and threatening Moscow with crippling tariffs.But recent evidence suggests that Trump operates on a whim. By this time next week he could have withdrawn his support, or alienated Zelenskyy with a brash demand. He could have ended the war, or he could have made it a thousand times worse. There’s no way of knowing. The whole thing is playing out at the speed of light, and it’s almost impossible to document. If you were tasked with making a film about Trump’s relationship with Russia, wouldn’t you take the easy option and focus on the past, too?Dispatches: Trump: Moscow’s Man in the White House? is on Channel 4Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewDonald TrumpVladimir PutinDocumentaryFactual TVreviewsShareReuse this content"

Over the years, the Netflix smash has in many ways come to represent everything bad about television’s streaming era.It began as a fun piece of fluff, a one-and-done collection of overt 1980s film references, designed as the first part of an unconnected anthology. But then it exceeded expectations, so the Duffer brothers found themselves having to pull an entire mythology out of thin air. And a bloated one at that, full of (at best) bottle episodes about punky young superheroes and (at worst) self-indulgent episodes that grind on for hours and hours.And because the episodes were so gargantuan, they took years to make. This is why you shouldn’t be excited about the return of Stranger Things. Whatever happened in the last batch of episodes has long since receded from memory and they were so long that you cannot possibly build up the enthusiasm to watch them all again. It is less a series and more a Man v Food challenge, served up long after you’ve forgotten what your last meal tasted of.And yet the first trailer for the final batch of Stranger Things episodes has dropped and goddamn it if I’m not suddenly really excited about it.What happens in the trailer? It’s hard to say. Joe Keery turns a wheel in a van. A bunch of lights flicker. There are flamethrowers. Someone jumps between trees during a lightning storm, pursued by a demon. A bunch of four-legged monsters prowl around a kitchen like raptors in Jurassic Park. There are machine guns and fast cars, and crying and flying and Vecna throwing a sort of burning tornado at the sky, all accompanied by Deep Purple’s Child in Time.Does it make sense? Not really. Is it so overloaded with mythology and superfluous characters that you felt you needed a diagram to remind you who everyone was? Almost certainly. But could I feel my heart start to race as it went on? Yes. The Stranger Things trailer isn’t the best trailer I’ve ever seen, but it might qualify as themosttrailer I’ve ever seen, and sometimes that does the trick.More than anything, it reinforces the direction that Stranger Things has been heading for the past nine years. There will be not a single atom of subtlety in these episodes. Any nuance will be forced out by a powerhouse of spectacle. Things will explode. There will be CGI by the gallon. Characters will operate exclusively in emotional red zones. For better or worse, you will end this series exhausted.However, there is one small hint that – despite the heavy metal frenzy that whirls around it – Stranger Things knows how it will stick the landing. It comes in the form of a snatch of dialogue between Hopper and Eleven. It isn’t much (“Let’s end this, kid”) but it’s a sign the key relationship of the entire series is back on track.View image in fullscreen‘Let’s end this, kid’ … Millie Bobby Brown as Eleven in Stranger Things.Photograph: Courtesy of NetflixDespite all the excess – the monsters, the nostalgia – Stranger Things was always a show about parenthood. It’s the story of a man who finds a weird little girl with nowhere to go, who helps him rebuild himself after experiencing the most devastating bereavement. Any time it has leant into the found-family dynamic between Hopper and Eleven, Stranger Things has found an emotional wallop that cannot be overwhelmed by the whiz-bang chicanery of the rest of the show. This is where Stranger Things began and I pray this is where it will end.That’s the pull of this trailer. The final season of Stranger Things will surely be too long. There will be too many storylines. There will be children riding bicycles even though they are visibly so old they should really have been driving their own children to school for the past decade. But if it remembers to focus on its heart – on the dynamic between a man and a girl who saved each other – then it might be worth getting excited about Stranger Things after all.Explore more on these topicsStranger ThingsTelevisionNetflixfeaturesShareReuse this content"

And it was clearly the murder of Lincoln. And once I dug in and started to turn up some stuff, I realized there was something there.”Aprofessorin Afro-American and African studies at the University of Michigan, fascinated by the civil war since childhood, Ellsworth knew full well Lincoln is one of themost-written-aboutfigures in history. But Ellsworth is not your average professor. Having beendescribedas “a historian with the soul of a poet”, and havingwona PEN/ESPN award for literary sports writing too, he knew he could tell the story his way.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Penguin Random House“I’m trying to reach a broad audience,” he said. “I’m trying to reach readers who wouldn’t necessarily, or very rarely, pick up a piece of nonfiction, certainly history. And I was lucky in the sense that I had this surfeit of material that is so great and so dramatic, the question is just how to put it together. Story is very important.“I’ve got some early responses from folks who’ve read a lot on the subject and said, ‘I never really thought of it in these ways.’ I think I managed to turn up some stuff that most civil war readers aren’t aware of.”In the popular imagination, Booth has come to be seen as a dysfunctional personality turned lone assassin, the first in a line that includes Lee Harvey Oswald, who killed John F Kennedy in Dallas, Texas, in 1963, andThomas Michael Crooks, who tried to kill Donald Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania,just a year ago. Ellsworth set out to shatter that idea.“On the image of Booth, I go into detail about the New York Times, the Chicago Tribune, everybody calling him this genius – people getting turned away by the hundreds from his performances, women trying to storm into his dressing room. The popular conception of who he is [is] just wrong. He’s not that person at all.“It lives on today. On Broadway right now, there’s the show,Oh Mary![about Lincoln’s wife] which is very raunchy and very hilarious. But in that, again, Booth is this kind of loser. That’s ingrained in us – that’s who he was, a disturbed loser. He wasn’t. He was a star.“And so if I can help change your mind and open your eyes to a different version of Booth, then you can start to see him in a different light.”Booth did not act alone. Confederate conspiracies ranged wide, from planners in Richmond, Virginia, to agents in Canada and in northern states with whom Booth schemed. In November 1864, agents attemptedto burn down New York City, an incident Ellsworth recreates vividly. Confederate agents plotted first to kidnap Lincoln, then to kill him.Last year, as Ellsworth worked, the national spotlight found the Confederate plot, when the leading Trump ally Steve Bannontold a reporterTrump’s frequent use of the word “retribution” on the campaign trail was a nod to codewords used by the plotters.Events during the plot are familiar too: anear-missas Lincoln rode from the White House tothe Soldiers’ Home in northern DC; Booth’s presence in the crowd for Lincoln’s second inaugural on 4 March 1865, visible ina famous photograph; the actor’s response to remarks Lincolngaveon 11 April, the promise of citizenship for Black men prompting Booth to tell associates: “That is the last speech he will ever make.”But among aspects Ellsworth holds to new light is a much less-known near-miss, on a frigid night in January 1865 when Lewis Powell, one of Booth’s co-conspirators, hid in the shadows outside the war department, close by the White House, and waited for Lincoln to show.View image in fullscreenA statue of Abraham Lincoln.Photograph: Brian Rimm/courtesy of President Lincoln’s Cottage.Ellsworth writes: “Here was his chance. A well-aimed shot, even from behind the bushes, might work. That, or a quick dash for one at close range.“Only he had not counted on the second man. Probably a bodyguard, and more than likely armed. And then there was the ground itself.“Could he even run on it at all? What if he fell? Powell hesitated. The two men walked away. The moment was lost.”Follow Ellsworth to his extensive notes, and they reveala 1907 memoirby David Homer Bates, one of the first military telegraphists in Lincoln’s war department. That obscure volume and another, onCivil War Weather in Virginia, furnish key details.Elsewhere on Ellsworth’s wide canvas, a little less obscure but no less fascinating, is Lois Adams, a Michigan newspaper reporter who worked as a government clerk in Washington and sent detailed letters back to her state, which Ellsworth uses to enrich his picture of wartime DC.“There was this wonderful librarian at Central Michigan University who discovered Adams’s letters and put them together ina book,” Ellsworth said, referring to Evelyn Leasher. “I ran into the book, and the more I read, I just thought of Adams, ‘She’s just dynamite.’ She is a keen observer of lots of things … about Washington during the war. She added such a richness to things, and she saw through things immediately.“And so I kept inserting her throughout the book, because I think she adds such a fascinating perspective but she sees she’s really undeservedly forgotten. She needs a lot more attention.”Ellsworth also presents the stories of the former slaves who followed the Union armies to freedom as the war neared its end, and of African American leaders who sought to seize the chance of liberty, the remarkableHenry Highland Garnetprominent among them.View image in fullscreenArlington National Cemetery.Photograph: Kevin Carter/Getty ImagesAfter Lincoln’s killing, Booth escaped into Virginia. After a 12-day chase – the subject of the recentApple TV miniseries Manhunt– the killer was killed in turn. Lincoln’s body was taken back to Springfield, Illinois, the funeral train retracinghis journey to Washingtonin 1861. Ellsworth concludes his own story at Arlington National Cemetery, across the Potomac from DC, on the grounds of the home of Robert E Lee, the leading Confederate general.In doing so, Ellsworth asks readers to look beyond the death of Lincoln, to the country he left behind, the “Rebirth of America” of the subtitle to Ellsworth’s book. At the cemetery, in section 27, people once enslaved lie with Black and white soldiers who died for the Union cause. Ellsworth said he set his final scene there in order “to remind Americans of the glories of our past, and of the incredible Americans that have built this country.“One thing I want people to know is how close we came to losing our country to the Confederacy, of slavery surviving in some form, for a while at least. It’s just by the skin of our teeth that the Union is held together, but it was held together by this remarkable coalition which we’d never really seen before, in the US, of men and women, Black and white, native-born and immigrant people putting aside differences to come together, ultimately, to work for a common goal.“We need to honor the courage and grit that these loyal citizens showed, to endure those four years of hell. One out of every 50 Americans died during the war. Every family in the north lost somebody, and they were able to hang in there through it all. I want us to recognize that, and to recognize that we have plenty of heroes in our past, and I think it’s helpful to look toward them as some of our institutions are under attack now, and remember that they paid a very high price.“The runaways, the formerly enslaved, the Union soldiers, they could not have imagined the America that we have today. But we wouldn’t have it, had it not been for them. They helped to build it, and we owe them something.”Midnight on the Potomac isout now.Explore more on these topicsBooksHistory booksAbraham LincolnPolitics booksfeaturesShareReuse this content"

When the first airstrike slammed into the building, Ali ran: not away from danger but towards it, risking his own safety for mine. That morning, as subsequent strikes rattled the walls around us and as I phoned my sister (“Tell Mum and Dad I love them heaps – just in case”), Ali remained by my side.Seldom in history have healthcare workers been called upon to risk their lives simply by reporting for duty.I am not referring to people such as myself – the internationally mobile staff who fly freely in and out of crisis zones, quietly reassured that safety awaits us at the end of our assignments. We return home to security, to family and, sometimes, to applause. Occasionally we are even lauded as heroes. But “hero” is a label I reject. It does not belong to me.It belongs to those who don’t have the option to leave: the Palestinian healthcare and humanitarian workers who have reported for duty every single day for 650 days under siege. Working alongside them has been the greatest honour of my life.And the children we care for – they too carry their own brand of heroism.Israeli strike kills at least 10 children queueing for medical treatment in GazaRead moreI think of Nayla*, a 10-year-old girl who came to our field hospital after an airstrike. Her limbs were shattered – and the pressure generated from the shock wave was so immense that her stomach and small intestine had perforated. Her mother, along with her brother, had died in the same strike that left her small body riddled with holes. By then the blockade had ensured our supplies were reduced to critically low levels. Rationing the fuel to run our operating theatres, short on surgical supplies for her fractures and gastrointestinal repairs, and without the specialised nutrition needed to keep her alive, Nayla fought. She was so malnourished that her wounds refused to heal. Infection invaded her bones. The night Nayla awoke from her coma I lay awake in my tent, listening to her screams – she cried for a mother who would never come.Then there were the young siblings, lying side by side. Their bodies had been torn apart by shrapnel and the fragments embedded so deeply that the surgeons had to dig them out, one by one.Just a few feet away lay the bruised and mottled body of a four-month-old orphan. His leg was encased in plaster, after having been broken before he could even learn to crawl. There would be no one to carry him – he had already lost both parents in a separate airstrike two months earlier.These stories were not exceptional. I heard them over and over – different voices and faces, but each story marred by the same injustice.What I witnessed in Gaza was not war – it was a massacre.In among this grief were the myriad staff who had been stripped of their homes and families – yet still travelled from the funerals of their own children and the rubble of their homes to care for the injured and dying. One doctor risked his safety walking four hours each way to complete his 24-hour shift, after airstrikes had rendered roads impassable.A small number even had a brief opportunity to flee in the early weeks of the war. They refused. They chose instead to farewell their families – perhaps for the last time – then quietly returned to their posts.A cursory glance at the reported data shows how real the risk is. Conservative estimates show that airstrikes, shelling and gunshotshave killedmore than1,580 healthcare workers and almost 18,000 children.These are not just statistics. They are people I knew. They are the people who stayed.If our leaders allow this to pass without consequence or condemnation, it reveals a disturbing truth about what we are willing to accept: that the execution of healthcare workers and the slaughter of children has become our new norm.The steps needed to save these children – and the workers risking their lives to care for them – are not just nebulous ideals.Australia must demand an unequivocal end to the blockade andweaponisation of aid. The fortnight prior to my departure from Gaza, the specialised nutrition that Nayla had needed initially wasn’t available in a single medical facility across the strip. I learned today that she will go on to have her leg amputated.We must demand an end to the bombing of hospitals and bulldozing of ambulances. Al-Aqsa hospital has been targeted with airstrikes yet again since I was last there. Not a single ministry of health hospital remains fully functional.We must demand a permanent ceasefire so that doctors and nurses can care for victims of war, without laying down their own lives.When I think about heroism in the context of sacrifice, I think about Rifaat Radwan,one of 15 Palestinian emergency workersfound buried in a mass grave. He was shot while trying to rescue others. Just before he died, herecorded his final words: “Forgive me, Mama … This is the path I chose to help people.”His words echo those of my colleagues when I once pressed: “How do you keep going? Aren’t you exhausted?” She looked me in the eye, calmly: “Of course we’re tired. But this is our life now and this is probably how I die. If we die, we’ll do it saving as many lives as we can.”They are the real heroes. They are the ones who stay.

We’re entering a dangerous eraTheo BurgesThis superinjunction shows how easy it could be for a government to avoid proper scrutiny when ‘national security’ is invokedTheo Burges is a criminal barrister with a focus on national security lawsThu 17 Jul 2025 10.43 EDTLast modified on Thu 17 Jul 2025 11.03 EDTShareThis week, a British high court judge lifted a superinjunction designed to prevent the reporting of a leak that put the lives of Afghans who cooperated with the UK at risk. Thesuperinjunctionwas originally expected to be in force from September to December 2023. Instead, it kept details of a national scandal hidden from public scrutiny for years in an extraordinary example of national security providing legal cover for a political crisis.In attempting to remedy the impact of the leak, both Conservative and Labour governments will end upspending £850m. Andthousands of Afghansand their families have been brought to the UK via a secret resettlement programme. These significant decisions made by multiple governments have never been publicly scrutinised. So how was this allowed to happen?In discharging the superinjunction on Tuesday, Mr Justice Chamberlainacknowledgedthat this was an “unprecedented case”. We are far more used to superinjunctions being granted in relation to celebrities than to protect state secrecy. Indeed, this was the first time that we know of that one was granted on the government’s application and represents a step change in the means that it has to prevent the spread of potentially harmful or embarrassing information.This was also the first superinjunction that we know of that was madecontra mundum. This meant that it was an offence for anyoneto speak publicly about the fact that there had been a data breach, the various and extensive efforts made to mitigate the harm of the breach, or that there were restrictions in place preventing the reporting of said breach.The legal remedies open to the government of today, in the form of superinjunctions, are far more wide reaching than any available to previous governments. The deployment of a superinjunction in relation to matters of national security may well mark a new frontier in the executive’s attempt to maintain state secrecy.However, what has been clearthroughout the various applications for extension of the superinjunction is that there was increasing judicial unease. Mr Justice Chamberlain considered in July 2024 that the superinjunction “could no longer be maintained” –due, in part, to the inability for public scrutiny to take place and to the fact that those impacted by the list were denied the opportunity to benefit from public pressure on the government to do more for them.The court of appeal, however,saidit would be wrong to lift the order, and so the superinjunction remained in place. This follows a path of the judiciary generally deferring to the state on matters of national security. However, this position can only be sustained when the state provides full and proper disclosure.The original motivation for the superinjunction was to protect vulnerable Afghans’ lives. What is certain is the leak of their details, at the very least, added to the risk they faced and it was right the government took action to protect them. But serious questions need to be asked about how the risk to them was examined throughout the years the superinjunction was in place – and whether withholding information from public scrutiny improved the situation of those involved.It is of note that the reason for the superinjunction no longer being extended was largely due to a Whitehall review conducted by Paul Rimmer, a former deputy chief of defence intelligence. In essence, Rimmer stated that a person’s presence on the leaked list was not a “defining factor” in determining risk to an individual, rather it was an element of the risk posed to Afghans who had assisted the UK. Once this report was provided to the court, keeping the superinjunction in place was simply unsustainable. As a consequence, judicial tolerance for the government’s position ran out.Afghans have been betrayed yet again by this shocking UK data leak – and many don’t even know if they’re affected | Diane TaylorRead moreGiven the content of the government’s own report, it could be argued that the state had a large part in bringing down its own superinjunction. Indeed, following Chamberlain’s provisional view on 1 July 2025 that the superinjunction should be lifted, the government legal department confirmed that the defence secretary,John Healey, had decided to discontinue the secret Afghan resettlement scheme and applied to discharge the injunction.It’s concerning then that the decision over whether or not this unprecedented superinjunction was necessary was, seemingly, up to the government. The public interest can only be defended by robust judicial analysis based on the state providing the court with a full account of information. The deference granted to the state on matters of national security is predicated on full and proper disclosure. However, in the context of seemingly flexible government opinion, it is questionable whether such deference is warranted if the primary factor in determining such applications can change so readily.This seems particularly true when superinjunctions as powerful as this one are exercised far past their sell-by date. If government opinion is a determining factor in applications such as these, one might reasonably question what happens if the government’s opinion does not change. Could extensive powers, similar to this superinjunction, continue indefinitely, denying the media the opportunity to properly scrutinise important decision-making relating to highly sensitive political matters?This unprecedented case raises the question of whether the state is being fair and above board in what it tells judges and whether there can be sufficient interrogation of the state’s position regarding matters of national security. A question it will only become more urgent that we answer.Theo Burges is a criminal barrister with a focus on national security laws at Red Lion Chambers, LondonExplore more on these topicsSuperinjunctionsOpinionAfghanistanMinistry of DefencecommentShareReuse this content"

This is England’s great artificial water crisis of 2025George MonbiotIn its refusal to renationalise water, it’s clear the government operates in the interests of private capital and not of the countryThu 17 Jul 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 17 Jul 2025 08.04 EDTShareFor a rich and fairly stable country, we arestaggeringly ill-preparedfor climate shocks. We respond topredictable crisesas if we had had no warning. Lessons from previous disasters go unlearned, mistakes are recycled, failures lodged so deeply that they come to define the system.This is not because of a deficiency in the national character, but because of a deficiency in the ideology of government: an elite belief, shared by scarcely any citizens, that public intervention should be used only when all other measures have failed. Until that point, our problems should be addressed by the private sector. As droughtrolls across the countryonce again, England’s privatised water system guarantees an irrational response.Nothing undermines climate resilience in this country as much as the private ownership of our water system, and nothing reveals the drought of political ambition like the refusal to renationalise it. Once again we find ourselves confronting simultaneously both the climate crisis and the political crisis.Climate breakdown is the result of a global failure to address the power of private capital. Labour’s response to its impacts reflects the same timidity. As successive governments have stood and watched, we have been comprehensively rinsed by the water companies. The current administration seems prepared to go to any lengths not to break this pattern.Margaret Thatcher promised that water privatisation would deliver higher investment. But adetailed analysisby the public service union Unison found that, between 1990 and 2023, there was no net investment at all. “Investors” spent £3.6bn buying shares in 1989 and 1990, but by March 2023 total shareholder equity across the water sector amounted to £3.4bn. In real terms (taking inflation into account), that means a 60% reduction in shareholder capital.Over that period, shareholders managed to extract £77.6bn (in 2023 prices) in dividends from the water companies. Add this to the withdrawal of equity, and you discover that they have squeezed £82.4bn out of public assets. Much of this money was obtained through loading the companies with debt. Instead of borrowing to pay for infrastructure improvement, water companiesborrowed to payfor dividends. They knew that if the enterprise one day became insolvent as a result, it would be someone else’s problem. Ultimately,as we now discoverin the case of Thames Water, it becomes our problem. Just as the water companies dump their sewage in the rivers, they have also dumped their liabilities on the public. The country becomes their dustbin.Fixing England’s water isn’t just the right thing to do – it can be the start of Labour’s fightback | Clive LewisRead moreFor 36 years, these companies have acted as dispensers of free money to their owners,most of which are foreign, some of which are foreign states. In fact, the only government not permitted to own England’s water supply is the UK’s. They must see us as total suckers, giving away our national infrastructure, land and assets … for less than nothing.Any investments have been funded not by shareholders but by their customers, through our water bills. Theserose in the same periodby 360%, more than twice the general rate of inflation. The rise has since accelerated. Every year, we pay £2.3bnmore for our waterand sewerage bills than we would if the suppliers were publicly owned, according to research by the University of Greenwich. High bills, impossible debts, filthy rivers, minimal investment and no resilience: that is the gift of privatisation.One of the results of this asset-stripping model is that leakage rates remain disgracefully high. While thehosepipe bansnow being introducedaround the nationare likely to save between 3% and 7% of the water we would otherwise use, 19% of the water piped through the network islost through leakage. Compare this with the publicly owned Dutch system,which loses 4%. For the same reason, no major reservoirhas been completedhere since 1992.Demand management has beenjust as hopeless, with the result that, without further action, waterdemand will exceed supplyby 2034. Given that their profits from metered customers depend on the amount we use, the water companies have a powerful incentive not to address the problem. Instead, as supplies become critically low, they insist that they must be allowed toextract even morefrom our rivers and aquifers, with dire impacts on wildlife and water quality.For similar reasons, theyresist imposing hosepipe bansuntil the last possible moment. It seems crazy that this decision should be left to the water companies, with their perverse incentives and conflicts of interest, rather than being taken by public bodies; but this is yet another outcome of the public-bad, private-good elite ideology. Even senior Tory MPsexpressed frustrationthat government could not simply decide what needed to be done; but that’s the system they built, working as designed.As for the regulators, they too are useless by design. Ofwat, which is meant to protect the public interest, has succumbed to full-scale regulatory capture, assenior staff circulatebetween the water companies and the agency supposed to hold them to account. The Environment Agency, chronically underfunded and demotivated,almost halvedits water use inspections in the five years to 2023: a classic example of deregulation by stealth. The rules might remain on the statute book, but without monitoring and enforcement they might as well have been deleted.Throughout its history, water privatisation in the UK has been deeply unpopular. In 1986, a year after Thatcher proposed the policy,a poll showed71% opposed and only 21% in favour. Since then, opposition has only hardened: a poll a year ago revealed thatonly 8% of people believedwater should still be run by the private sector, while 82% wanted to see it renationalised. But two months later, the governmentruled this out. Why? Because, according to the environment secretary, Steve Reed, it would cost too much.Really? Aseries of analysesshow that the government could renationalise these companies fornext to nothing, not least because their real value isless than zero. There would be some administrative costs, but these are likely to be far smaller than the annual expense of sustaining the current system.It’s a simple test: does the government operate in the interests of the country, or in the interests of private capital? This shouldn’t be a difficult choice for Labour to make, yet, as with so many such tests, it flunks it. Why? Because it is terrified of any measure that might alienate even the most parasitic and extractive forms of capital. Strangely, however, it seems to have no qualms about alienating the rest of us.George Monbiot is a Guardian columnistOn Tuesday 16 September, join George Monbiot, Mikaela Loach and other special guests discussing the forces driving climate denialism, live at the Barbican in London and livestreamed globally.

Over to you, Merz and StarmerJohn KampfnerThe chancellor’s first London visit is an opportunity for a modernising reset – on business, defence and even school tripsThu 17 Jul 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 17 Jul 2025 16.33 EDTShareLook at the Germany shelf of your local British bookshop and, if one exists at all, it will almost certainly be filled with tomes about the Nazis and the two world wars. To write a book about contemporary Germany, to write anything complimentary – as I have done – is to buck the trend, even now, after all these years. And it still rankles. Many Germans still remember the infamous Mirror headline during the 1996 Euro football championships:Achtung! Surrender!Which is why today’s signing of thefirst UK-Germany friendship treaty, with defence and military cooperation at its heart, is so important. The accord is designed to smooth out post-Brexit problems, and forms the centrepiece of Friedrich Merz’s first visit to London as chancellor. The Germans will be happy that school trips to the UK will be made less tricky. Britons will be relieved that regular visitors, especially for business, may at some point be able to register for E-gate entry.From cybersecurity and digital links to green hydrogen and healthcare, both countries will seek ways of working together to improve resilience and modernise their economies. Some pledges are more concrete than others. So-called lighthouse projects, which promise to forge new links between the two nations, include a business forum, a youth summit, culture initiatives and a reannouncement of a direct train link betweenLondon and Cologne.As a first step, the symbolism matters most. The UK andGermany– perhaps the two countries most closely aligned when Britain was inside the EU – are starting out afresh in a darker world.Merz has still some way to go before completing his first 100 days in office, but he has already put his stamp on diplomacy. He has largely repairedrelations with France; he has made Germany a presence again in Brussels. Most of all, he has given his country heft inEuropean securitynot seen since the end of the cold war. His language on Russia is refreshingly blunt; his resolve to stand by Ukraine is hearteningly clear.He seesKeir Starmeras a key figure and has made a point of mentioning Britain whenever he can. Although Poland is also regarded as an important player, the old E3 grouping – Germany, France and the UK – is being restored.Merz, Starmer and Emmanuel Macron consult regularly on all the various flashpoints; before each of their pilgrimages to the Oval Office, they talked about the best way of dealing with Donald Trump. They still do. They all realise that Europe will have to defend itself. The new Nato commitment of 3.5% of GDP on direct military spending plus a further 1.5% on critical infrastructure is supposed to be sacrosanct. Germany has promised tohit the target by 2029; what isn’t clear is how quickly the other member states will get there.The immediate task is to keep the Americans present inEuropefor as long as possible, to extend the transition for as long as possible, and to coordinate as much as possible. It is here where the British can be most helpful.The strength of all these relationships will ultimately be based on day-to-day practical decision-making and not on formalities. Merz’s brief foray to London was never going to match the pageantry of Macron’s state visit last week, nor the fraught preparations already under way for Trump’s second such extravaganza to the UK in September.It’s important not to get carried away about a new era of E3 harmony. With Britain outside the EU and Starmer looking over his shoulder towards Nigel Farage at every turn, there is only so much Germany (and France) will be willing or able to do with the UK. All three leaders have an insecure hold on power as they face challenges from the hard right.Written off by someeven before he started, Merz is attacked within his own party for making concessions to his coalition partners, the Social Democrats, while his government is embroiled in its first big row, over appointments tothe constitutional court.Negotiations on this treaty were hamstrung both by the collapse of Olaf Scholz’s administration last autumn and by a constant suspicion on the German side of British grandstanding and what they see as a reluctance to do what it really takes to reset relations with the EU as a whole. Since Brexit, indeed long before Brexit, much of the bilateral conversation has been stuck in the past. German speakers at conferences seem to feel the need, 80 years on, to make some kind of reference to Churchill, to their own perfidy and to British bravery. The British hark on about the army on the Rhine and their role in the cold war.All the while, tens of thousands of Britons have moved to Germany in recent years, working in startups, biomedicine and the creative sector. The institutions and the political discourse do not speak to their lived experience.One of the tasks of the negotiators has been to future-proof the treaty, to insulate it from sudden political or economic lurches at home and abroad. They want it to last for a generation. It is a valiant aim. But given how little Starmer and Merz are in control of events, it is almost certainly a forlorn one.John Kampfner is the author of In Search of Berlin and Why the Germans Do It BetterExplore more on these topicsGermanyOpinionEuropeFriedrich MerzKeir StarmercommentShareReuse this content"

The bright day turned to dark in the time it took.Now, the playground near the site in Tuam has been dismantled and the long-awaitedexhumation has begun. But why has it taken more than a decade since it emerged that those dead children were likely buried in sewage chambers on the grounds of a publicly funded institution run by nuns and the local council?A technical drawing from the 1970s of the council housing estate built on the grounds showed “old children’s burial ground” written directly above “proposed playground”. Local authorities knew long ago.News first broke in 2014 afterCatherine Corless, who was working on a history project, tracked down death certificates for nearly 800 children for whom there were almost no burial records. She had gone to the Bon Secours Sisters, the Catholic organisation that ran the home, to the local bishop and the authorities. Little was done until she went to the media.It is a vindication of Corless’s work that the exhumation is taking place, but also disturbing that it was never a certainty.I had already started writing a book about survivors of Ireland’s institutions for “unmarried mothers” when a test excavation publicly confirmed “significant human remains” at Tuam, dating to the time the nuns ran the home, between 1925 and1961. In 2018, the public was asked what should be done. I keep thinking of the “talking stone”, a lump of grey felt handed around a public meeting organised by Galway county council, which owned the site, in a Tuam hotel. We were asked to hold it and say what we wanted to happen about a mass grave of babies. Options ranged from memorialisation alone to the full forensic excavation happening today. While it was important to talk about it, it also felt surreal and even wrong, with some people asking why the site was not being treated as any other crime scene.One man described Tuam as “ground zero” and begged: “Dig those bodies up, every one of them, all over the country. Give the children some dignity.” Even if one family was able to get an answer, it was worth it. A woman from the housing estate pointed out that she had “no right to tell a survivor you cannot identify where your brother or sister is” and hoped the children would not be left “in a cesspit with just a plaque”.It was survivors, families and all those who wanted the truth for them who fought relentlessly against an ongoing silence from church and state. It was activists such as Izzy Kamikaze, who found an old map showing cesspools in the grounds that wereknown locally to have included a burial site. Bones had been found sporadically down the years.As the former Irish president Mary McAleese said about systemic abuse: “We heard it through the media, we heard it through the courage of victims, we heard it through lawyers, we heard it through government. We never really heard it openly, spontaneously from our church.”I would say we never heard it first from those in power either, even when, in the case of the Tuam children, they hadaccess to the informationlong before, from earlier investigations.View image in fullscreenCatherine Corless in 2014, when she found the death certificates of the children who had died at the Tuam institution.Photograph: Patrick Bolger/Patrick Bolger PhotogrraphyAt a council meeting in the 1960s, an influential politician argued against the impending closure of Tuam, saying, “The county has the benefit of the money spent there.” I reported how aTuam survivor fosteredby the same politician spoke of abuse and exploitation for labour. She died before seeing any justice.“Our Lord was crucified and so were the women of this country,” PJ Haverty, a Tuam survivor who first took me to the burial site, told me. “The nuns had power, it was all about money and it was all about power.” His mother had gone to the nuns day after day trying to get her baby back.Tuam was just one in a system of institutions that operated until as recently as 2006, where unmarried pregnant women were sent to give birth, were effectively incarcerated and, in many cases, were forcibly separated from their children: more than 50,000 mothers and more than 50,000 children. Acommission of investigation, forced by the news of Tuam, began in 2015 and concluded in 2021, finding that 9,000 children had died in these “homes”. But it called the institutions “refuges” and dismissed survivor testimonies about the inhumanity and abuses. Theofficial redress schemenow excludesthousands of survivors, seemingly to cut costs.In 2018, during the government press conference announcing the decision to excavate, I was told by the then children’s minister Katherine Zappone thatTuam could set a precedent for other institutions. There are many families still searching for answers. There are also mass graves on the grounds of similar institutions in the UK, the US and Canada. The crimes of the Catholic church are global.At the memorial last year, Tuam survivorPeter Mulryantold me he didn’t want to sign the legal waiver required for redress, under which recipients agree not to take any further action against the state about their experience, so preventing any legal justice, describing it as “another insult to survivors”. But, at 81, he felt he had no choice and is happy others aretaking the case to court. Mulryan was one of many Tuam children “boarded out” to a farm, and he told me he was brutally exploited there, with no justice or redress.His mother was sent to the Galway Magdalene laundry for the rest of her life. Corless found a sister he never knew about, who had died at Tuam. He hasspoken outfor most of a decade, hoping to find her.View image in fullscreenPeter Mulryan is a survivor of the Bon Secours mother-and-baby home in Tuam.Photograph: Charles McQuillan/Getty ImagesReligious sisters did speak to me for my book, but were often silenced by superiors or after legal advice. Meanwhile, voices fromwithin the religious right, including the president of the Catholic League in the US, have called Tuam “a hoax”, in a country where reproductive rights are rolled back and Catholic hospitals have increasing influence. The Bon Secours order is part of an international healthcare conglomerate worth billions in the US.Terry Prone, whose PR firm acted for the Bon Secours Sisters, wrote anow infamous emailwhen the news first broke, calling it the “O my God – mass grave in West of Ireland” story and warning a French TV journalist: “You’ll find no mass grave, no evidence that children were ever so buried.”Ireland’s mother-and-baby homes are a stain on the Catholic church - but this latest refusal to atone is a new low | Rhiannon Lucy CosslettRead moreAt a reading of my book, a man repeated the hoax claim, even after public photos from the test excavation showed the slits in a huge tank, making any proper burial impossible, the blurred photos of infant bones inside, and a baby’s blue shoe. Despite this, religious and political conservatives in Ireland, rallying against recent progressive changes, have even argued for bringing backsuch institutions.From the earliest years, the state knew that “illegitimate” children in these institutions were dying at sometimes five times the rate of children born within marriage. Death certificates show children dying of malnutrition, or marked as “imbecile”, one boy convulsing for 12 hours before dying. The children’s lives were not valued.I think of Julia Devaney, a domestic worker in Tuam, whodescribed it in taped interviewsas barracks-like, smelling of the wet beds of frightened and deprived children, while nuns treated officials from local authorities to lavish dinners on the grounds. Devaney said a nun who worked there left the Bon Secours because of what she saw. “They knew well that the home was a queer place, ’twas a rotten place,” said Devaney. “I feel a sense of shame that I did not create a war.”Survivors are still fighting their long battle for truth and justice, hoping similar injustices will never be repeated. I believe that even today church and state perpetuate the silences and inequalities that led to a mass grave of children. This excavation can be a reckoning, a reminder to those in power to listen to those who are owed real accountability: the survivors and the families of the many children who can no longer speak.Caelainn Hogan is an Irish journalist and the author of Republic of ShameDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Sir Keir Starmer dodges popular economic solutions and confuses control for leadershipThu 17 Jul 2025 13.39 EDTLast modified on Thu 17 Jul 2025 15.10 EDTShareSir Keir Starmer’s crackdown on dissent has been a troubling hallmark of his leadership. Muzzling protest over welfare cuts won’t make the policies fairer or morepopular. He seems more focused on obedience than legitimacy. The timing – days before parliament rises – caught many Labour MPs off-guard. Some thought the leadership was softening; even Downing Street had preached “the need to bring people with us”. This week shows that the old instinct still dominates.Three out of the four MPs suspended –Brian Leishman, Chris Hinchliff and Neil Duncan‑Jordan– were elected in 2024. Their suspensions are probably meant to deter newly arrived MPs from stepping out of line. Each built an early political identity by standing up to the government. Mr Leishman opposed the closure of Grangemouth oil refinery. Mr Hinchliff defied planning reform on environmental grounds. Mr Duncan-Jordan criticised cuts to winter fuel payments.Even experienced figures weren’t spared.Rachael Maskell, a former shadow minister, lost the whip for opposing welfare cuts. Her suspension sends a message: no one is safe – not even those whosereasoningministers largely accepted when reversing course on the cuts. The problem isn’t Ms Maskell. It’s a party that can’ttolerate its conscience. Ministers who oncerevoltedbut now back thepurgeexpose the factional logic at the heart of Starmerism. Three prominent ethnic minority MPswere symbolically demotedby being stripped of their (largely ceremonial) trade envoy roles. Separately, Diane Abbott was suspended on Thursday evening over racism claims for the second time.Past Labour leaders knew when to absorb dissent. In 1997, Tony Blair kept his47 welfare rebelsin the party; Clement Attlee weathered revolts. Today, internal challenge is met not with debate but with exclusion – even with a157-seat majority. The final straw may have been that, even after ministers made concessions on their disability cuts,47 MPs– including all seven sanctioned this week – still voted against it. The message from Downing Street now looks less like authority and more like insecurity, especially when the rebels’concernsare widely shared by thepublic. It’s the political equivalent ofpour encourager les autres.Perhaps Sir Keir’s moves stem from the scale of the revolt – more than half the number needed to trigger a leadership challenge. But Labour famously doesn’t do regicide. It may also be that Downing Street wanted to issue a warning to potential ringleaders of brewing mutinies – onspecial educational needs reform, thetwo-child benefit capand the government’s forthcoming immigration bill. Unable to win by force of argument, Sir Keir opts for the argument of force. It’s a sign of weakness, not strength.Polling shows Labour is losing support not because of internal splits but because voters aredisappointedwith the substance of its policies. Labour has the evidence that economic populism works, but won’t use it,reportedlyout of deference to donor sensitivities. That’s not a communications problem. That’s a leadership one. The suspended MPs are not liabilities, they’re canaries in the coalmine. By punishing them, Labour silences warnings that it needs to hear. If Sir Keir’s team continues to equate principle with disloyalty, it risks alienating not just its base but the very voters who handed it power. Real strength doesn’t come from silencing disagreement. It comes from meeting the argument – and being made better by it.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

This July, however, locals have another uplifting occasion to celebrate. More than a century after it first opened in Durham in 1915, one of Europe’s most extraordinary monuments to working-class pride, self-confidence and optimism has been relaunched as a cultural centre and community hub.Boasting a white marble staircase, a domed roof and a spectacular debating chamber (the “pitman’s parliament”), theDurham Miners’ Hallwas originally built through the subscriptions of colliers working in what was one of the largest coalfields in Europe. Its refurbishment has been principally financed through the National Lottery Heritage Fund, and an official reopening is planned for the autumn. But events have already started to take place, including a public performance of mining songs by a primary school choir.The cultivation of communal memory in post-industrial regions can play an important role in evoking a sense of solidarity and belonging. But the charity trustees of Redhills – as the Miners’ Hall is locally known – hope its rebirth can deliver much more than nostalgia. In the early 20th century, the building became a potent symbol of what collective action could achieve, as Durham’s minersbuilttheir own tight-knit infrastructure of co-operatives, chapels, clubs and sports associations. That lost world was based on an industrial infrastructure that is no longer replicable. But in the north-east, and across the rest of the country, the question of how to foster greater social cohesion in alienated and disillusioned times has rarely been more urgent.This week, a majorreportfor the new Independent Commission on Community and Cohesion argued that throughout the UK “a ‘doom loop’ of inaction, crisis and piecemeal response had failed to strengthen the foundations of communities”. In places already resentful of years of neglect by policymakers, it noted a critical lack of sustained funding for grassroots groups working to enhance a sense of belonging and opportunity. Amid cuts to services and the ongoing cost of living crunch, large sections of communities felt socially cut off and mistrustful of institutions.A Redhillsauditof community organisations in County Durham, undertaken with University College London, identifies similar issues. The result, in the words of one youth worker, is a generalised sentiment that “it’s all a bit grim, all a bit pointless, and that … influences how people feel about themselves, how families feel about themselves … And it spirals from there.” Last summer’s racially chargedriotsin England – and more recentunrestin Northern Ireland – offer a disturbing illustration of the dangers when social disconnection turns toxic.By acting as a charismatic hub and local resource, Redhills’ welcome renaissance has the potential to become a local focus for social renewal. In the autumn, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development is due to visit as part of ongoing research into the relationship between community attachment and economic development in “left behind” places. Broader progress will only come, however, when the importance of communal wellbeing is prioritised in Whitehall as well, and ranked alongside a quest for growth that has focused mainly on Britain’s cities. As the old miners’ motto has it: “The past we inherit, the future we build.” But Westminster must play its part too.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The noise washes over the athletic track where Carl Lewis and Asafa Powell once broke the world record, and where Sweden are now flying out of the blocks and leaving England trailing in their dust.We do not yet know that in many ways this is simply the prologue, that this devastating early two-goal flurry is actually relatively benign in comparison with the carnage that will follow.England 2-2 Sweden (Eng won 3-2 on penalties): Euro 2025 player ratingsRead moreWe do not yet know that Lauren James will end up playing almost an hour in a double pivot. We do not yet know that Lucy Bronze will end up wearing the captain’s armband on her wrist and kicking a giant credit card advert. Hannah Hampton, nose still unbloodied, has not the faintest inkling that this will end up beingthe greatest night of her career.But they all know something. Even if they’re not entirely conscious of it. Even as an utterly shambolic England trail Sweden 2-0 and the obituaries for their Euro 2025 campaign are being scribbled, there is a little knot of refusal there, a team with an entirely unwarranted calmness at its core, a team that against all the available visual evidence still trusts that everything is going to work out eventually.Which, after half an hour of Swedish dominance, takes a pretty significant leap of faith. Alessia Russo has barely been able to get into the game, Georgia Stanway is manically scurrying around. Jess Carter, based on her chasing and pointing and deathly reluctance to touch the ball, is clearly training for a future career as a referee.OK, so you may not have underestimated Sweden. But you may just have overestimated yourselves. And perhaps this was the inevitable outcome of a buildup focused almost entirely on Sweden’s directness and physicality, on the need for England to show “proper English” qualities. There was no clear plan on the ball, and precious little quality in it in any case: an entire team so absorbed by the grapple that they had forgotten to trust in their technical ability.View image in fullscreenSarina Wiegman embraces Lucy Bronze as they celebrate after winning the shootout against Sweden on a night of outrageous drama in Zurich.Photograph: Michael Buholzer/APSweden, meanwhile, have come with an entirely transparent strategy: funnel the ball right, target England’s left-back weakness with long balls over the top and in behind, and simply wait to collect your jackpot. England have no runners from deep, no flying full-backs, no real intention to create overloads, and just the same hopeless balls punted up the channels.Even so, they know something. They know the depth they possess on their bench. They know that they have the back three to fall back on, different combinations and angles of attack. They know they have the legs to last 90 minutes and 120 if necessary. And most of all they know they are up against a team already instinctively beginning to entrench themselves, whose tournament history suggests a certain hard-wired frailty that they can prod and exploit, if only they can take this game deep enough.And so the lateness of Sarina Wiegman’s substitutions, almost a kind of wilful stubbornness, a blind faith that things would eventually come good, in the absence of any corroborating evidence. The vivid patterns of Chloe Kelly transform England’s right flank and the fresh legs of Michelle Agyemang offer a new threat alongside Russo. Bronze, by now suffused with main character energy, pops up at the back post to convert Kelly’s cross. Less than two minutes later, Agyemang pounces on Kelly’s header to level the game.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Even amid the farce and fragility of that penalty shootout, it is Sweden who crumble under the pressure while Bronze, Kelly and Hampton hold their nerve.In a way, you could scarcely hope to see a better example of the power of self-branding in tournament football. England have so often turned up with no more elaborate strategy than simplybeing England, making a virtue of doing just enough, simply hanging in there and trusting in their intrinsic pedigree to see them through. It was a strategy that powered a flawed team all the way through the last World Cup final, and may just be good enough to do so again here.It is slightly trite to conclude that great teams win when playing badly. Perhaps the hallmark of certain great teams is in sensing almost subconsciously when they are allowed to play badly and when they are not, when the level needs to be raised, when the stakes are at their sharpest. It will probably be good enough against Italy; it will probably not be good enough against Spain or France. But for now this curate’s egg of a team rolls judderingly, thrillingly, onto its next grand climax.Explore more on these topicsWomen’s Euro 2025England women's football teamSweden women's football teamWomen's footballanalysisShareReuse this content"

It just appeared as if nobody was minded to pay heed to them on a day when Rory McIlroy’s competitive return to Northern Ireland turned every head andScottie Schefflerperformed his usual trick of hiding in plain sight.McIlroy seemed to battle his game more than the elements for much of round one but emerged unscathed and under par. McIlroy lacks nothing in tenacity, a matter which is often overlooked. His 70 leaves him just three from the lead in what is a wonderfully congested major.Rory McIlroy flirts with 2019 Open nightmare but recovers to keep dream intactRead moreThe problem for all involved may well be that Scheffler is already only one adrift after a round where he ranked 150th in driving accuracy. “When it’s raining sideways, it’s actually, believe it or not, not that easy to get the ball in the fairway,” said Scheffler, needing only a saucer of milk. If Scheffler has finally cracked the Open code, it feels like a question of who will be second.Harris English arrived without his caddie, Eric Larson being denied travel from the US because of a drug conviction from three decades ago. English wandered into a bustling Portrush bar on Wednesday evening without so much as head turns from locals. Harris is 54 holes from becoming the first English man to win the Open since 1992.Christiaan Bezuidenhout swallowed rat poison as a two-year-old, an event which proved significant during the Amateur Championship at Royal Portrush in 2014. Bezuidenhout was using beta blockers to help with a stammer related to the childhood incident, triggering a failed doping test and a ban which was later reduced from two years to nine months.Sadom Kaewkanjana is seeking to become the first ordained monk to lift the Claret Jug. Kaewkanjana’s scenario led to a quite wonderful post-round media moment, as the Thai was asked whether he may consider dedicating himself to Buddhism at a later date. “My goal is to play in the Masters,” came the reply. Shove your meditation, give me Magnolia Lane.This was golf’s longest day. Rounds stretched to six hours, a preposterous if unavoidable situation with a 156-man field and penal rough. McIlroy’s group took four hours to play 11 holes. Keegan Bradley, the US Ryder Cup captain, recounted five groups playing or waiting to play the 7th at the same time. “It felt like we were on the golf course for about 12 hours,” said Marc Leishman. “We had been on the course for three hours through eight holes.” Grim.As darkness fell, five players topped the pack at four under. English and Bezuidenhout were joined by a resurgent Matt Fitzpatrick, Li Haotong and Jacob Skov Olesen. Denmark’s Olesen won as an amateur on the links of Ballyliffin. He played the back nine on Thursday in an outstanding 32. Kaewkanjana, Scheffler, Matthew Jordan and Tyrrell Hatton are one back. Hatton’s strong showing in last month’s US Open has clearly fuelled confidence. During such an attritional test, the occasionally combustible Englishman kept his head.View image in fullscreenChristiaan Bezuidenhout shares the lead and will be hoping to banish bad memories of the 2014 Amateur Championship.Photograph: Peter Byrne/PAThe morning starters endured squally, brutal conditions at times. A predicted afternoon storm bypassed this corner of the Causeway Coast. When McIlroy took to the opening tee, shortly after 3pm, the picture was one of serenity. It was therefore surprising that the four under par posted by Olesen, Li and Fitzpatrick – later matched by Bezuidenhout – was not headed until English made a birdie on the 12th. English promptly handed a shot back to the course on 14. Menacing pin positions played a key role in keeping scoring higher than would otherwise have been the case.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Lee Westwood, an avid Portrush fan, rolled back the years and rolled in the putts when reaching minus four inside 12 holes. Westwood played his closing stretch in plus two but was still rightly content with his 69. Rickie Fowler matched that score as did Nicolai Højgaard, who only qualified for the Open on Sunday. The fields of Aaron Rai? The Wolverhampton man joined the 69 club having been four under by the 9th tee. Justin Rose delivered two under shortly before 9pm. English closed out his round half an hour later.There were moments of chaos. Tommy Fleetwood’s ball finished in foot marks in a bunker on the 5th, calling into question the Royal & Ancient’s new policy of having caddies clean up after their players. Previous Opens had dedicated bunker rakers. Bryson DeChambeau whiffed a shot when knee high in rough at the 4th. One for the Californian’s YouTube channel, surely. DeChambeau’s day at the office added up to 78 blows and his worst opening round at a major.Wyndham Clark slumped to a 76 the day after it was confirmed he has been banned from Oakmont Country Club for physically abusing lockers. The R&A might need to order some reinforced wood. Other notables to struggle included Patrick Reed, who shot 77, Brooks Koepka and Collin Morikawa. The latter pair signed for 75s. This was the occasion of the underdog and a lurking Scheffler.Explore more on these topicsThe OpenRory McIlroyScottie SchefflerEuropean TourGolfPGA TourUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

After the first summit finish of 2025, the defending champion’s next overall victory now appears an inevitability. Pogacar beat his rival to the ski station finish by well over two minutes and now leads the Tour by more than three and half minutes, with nine stages remaining.Pas de suspense, the French would say, and after the Slovenian’s eighth career stage win in the Pyrenees, Vingegaard is scrambling to sustain a meaningful challenge. If Pogacar had been scared when crashing in Toulouse, 24 hours earlier, he showed no ill effects as he dealt a lethal blow to Vingegaard’s aspirations under a fierce Pyrenean sun.Tour de France 2025: Pogacar blows field away on stage 12 summit finish in Pyrenees – liveRead more“I feel at the best moment of my career,” he said. “I’m riding in the rainbow jersey, I ride with an amazing team, so it’s like a fairytale for me. I think once this fire goes out, I will probably decline in performance but I’d say that now is the peak of my career, and I’ll try to hold it for as long as I can.”He did admit to being anxious prior to the stage however. “I was nervous at the start, a little bit cranky maybe,” Pogacar said. “There was the role of 2022, when I lost the Tour here [at Hautacam]. I lost it that day and I guess I was really motivated.”Burned by Pogacar, Vingegaard is looking over his shoulder at those hot on his heels, including the Scottish climber Oscar Onley, who was fifth at Hautacam and is sustaining his challenge in sixth overall. The Dane has lost time to his Slovenian rival in the long time trial and in the Tour’s first summit finish. From here, it appears unlikely that he will be able to mount a challenge for the yellow jersey.There was more than a little questioning of his Visma-Lease a Bike team’s tactics, after Vingegaard arrived at the foot of the final climb alone and surrounded by UAE Emirates riders. Long gone was Matteo Jorgenson, who had started the stage fifth overall but fell back on the Col du Soulor. Nor was there any sign of Simon Yates, winner on Puy de Sancy, but now unable to help his leader.Pogacar’s decisive move came at the foot of the 13km ascent after he was set up by his Ecuadorian teammate Jhonatan Narváez. Initially, Vingegaard kept the defending champion in sight, the gap hovering at a handful of seconds, but as the pursuit wore on, Pogacar cruised clear. Emmanuel Macron briefly joined Christian ­Prudhomme in the race director’s car and the French ­president was treated to a ringside seat as Pogacar powered up the slopes.Further down the mountain, Ben Healy was toiling up the climb, eventually losing the best part of 14 minutes to the Slovenian. In furnace conditions, Healy’s overall leadership had wilted on the exposed climb of the Col du Soulor, where Remco Evenepoel also suffered and lost ground.The morning after Pogacar’s crash on the approach to Toulouse, the polemics over the peloton’s decision to wait for the Slovenian continued. In the end, however, it was an irrelevance. The show of sportsmanship from Healy and Vingegaard was not lost on Demi Vollering, whose crash while leading the 2024 Tour de France Femmes, after which the peloton did not look back, effectively cost her the race. “So kind of the bunch not to use this crash ofTadej Pogacarto take time on him,” she posted on Instagram. “Guess men are a bit more kind.”It also was a mournful convoy that entered the Pyrenees, the morning after a promising talent had been lost to a high-speed crash, following the death of young Italian Samuele ­Privitera, who was killed on Wednesday while racing in the Giro delle Valle d’Aosta.According to reports in the Italian media, the 19-year-old crashed as the peloton was riding downhill at 70kph. He is understood to have fallen and hit the iron gate of a house, losing his helmet during the impact and suffering a cardiac arrest. Thursday’s second stage of the Giro delle Valle d’Aosta was cancelled.The Italian was riding for the Hagens Berman Jayco development team, a feeder outfit for Jayco AlUla, currently riding in the Tour. In tribute, there was a minute’s applause at the start of stage 12 in Auch. Axel Merckx, son of Eddy and manager of the Hagens Berman team, said that the rider’s loss was “devastating beyond words.”Friday’s stage 13 time trial, from Loudenvielle to Peyragudes is unlikely to change the current narrative, although Evenepoel will be keen to bounce back and exploit any further weakness on the part of Vingegaard. Pogacar however, is expected to increase his overall lead.Explore more on these topicsTour de France 2025Tour de FranceCyclingTadej PogacarnewsShareReuse this content"

In 2021 she then won her first Chicago marathon before following it up a year later in 2022, when she ran 2:14.18. That time broke her personal best by three minutes, but two years later there was an even bigger jump when she ran 2:09.56 to shatter Tigst Assefa’s previous world record of 2:11.53.After the race she was asked by a journalist from the website Let’s Run whether her run “was too good to be true”, and asked what her response would be to people who doubted her. “I don’t have any idea,” Chepngetich said.A day later several members of the Kenyan parliament criticised the journalist for questioning their national hero. Gladys Boss Shollei, deputy speaker of the Kenyan National Assembly, called the allegations against Chepngetich “baseless, unprofessional and disrespectful”.Athletics Kenya also said it was “preposterous to cast aspersions on a seasoned winner like Chepngetich who has upheld integrity and hard work throughout her career”.“In any case, many world records were broken this year and to single her out is utterly unfair,” it added. “It is therefore disheartening to hear some sections of the media casting unwarranted doubts on her achievements.”The head of the AIU, Brett Clothier, said that Chepngetich was “notified and interviewed in person by the AIU in Kenya on 16 April and complied with requests regarding our investigation”.“When there is a positive test for diuretics and masking agents, a provisional suspension is not mandatory under the World Anti-Doping Code,” he said. “Chepngetich was not provisionally suspended by the AIU at the time of notification. However, on 19 April, she opted for a voluntary provisional suspension while the AIU’s investigation was ongoing.“In the intervening months, the AIU continued its investigation and today issued a notice of charge and imposed its own provisional suspension.”Chepngetich, who has the right for her case to be heard before a disciplinary tribunal, has been approached for comment via her agent, Frederico Rosa.HCTZ is a diuretic, used clinically to treat fluid retention and hypertension. Under the World Anti-Doping Code it is regarded as a class S5 prohibited substance (diuretics and masking agents), prohibited at all times and a specified substance. Diuretics may be abused to mask the presence in urine of other prohibited substances.“A specified substance has a standard sanction of two years’ ineligibility, subject to possible reduction or increase in accordance with Wada code provisions,” the AIU said.Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Explore more on these topicsAthleticsDrugs in sportnewsShareReuse this content"

In 2016 he and Kyle Sinckler were Eddie Jones’s “rough diamonds”, picked to get a taste of an international tour but nowhere near Test selection. Six years on and in England’s second Test against the Wallabies in Brisbane,Genge kickstarted a victorythat saved Jones’s job with a thunderous carry into Michael Hooper. Three years later, back in the same city, Genge makes his British & Irish Lions Test bow against Australia.Afternaming Gengein Saturday’s side, the head coach, Andy Farrell, encouraged the 30-year-old loosehead prop to take a moment to reflect on how far he has come. It does not come easily to Genge but his growing influence on the international sides he represents is obvious. He confesses that nine years ago he and Sinckler “tried to get out of the way as much as we could” and “were out enjoying ourselves a bit too much”. In 2022, England had lost the series opener to the Wallabies and Genge was wound up by perceived provocation from opponent Taniela Tupou but inspired as Jones’s side levelled the series in Brisbane.‘Make it happen when it matters’ – Andy Farrell urges Lions to embrace pressureRead more“I was in a good spot. If I can get to there again, I will be over the moon,” adds Genge. “I played quite well. We were quite fired up as a team that week. Obviously we lost the first Test. I was vice-captain on that tour and felt quite a bit of responsibility. It feels quite numbing to get to that emotional state. The comedown you have after it is quite monumental. You don’t sleep a wink. Fingers crossed I get there on Saturday.”Farrell evidently believes he can. The head coach has told his players to embrace the expectation that comes with being heavy favourites and has challenged Genge to walk tall. “Faz said in the meeting that you should have a swagger about yourself, you should be proud, you should take a second to think: ‘You have done it,’” added Genge. “That stuck with me a bit because I have rarely taken the opportunity to reflect on my career thus far. I felt that if you start doing that and looking back, you struggle to get out of second gear sometimes. I have not done it for a long time. All the messages flood in. The questions and the phone calls and you realise that it is a big deal.“[It made me] a bit uncomfortable. I don’t really like the praise too much. I don’t like the conversations and the texts. I think you would be naive to say you were not unbelievably proud of what you have achieved thus far. But someone said to me at the beginning of this year that there is a difference between being a Lion and being a winning Test Lion. Hopefully we can make that happen.”View image in fullscreenEllis Genge rumbles forward for England in the Brisbane Test in July 2022.Photograph: Cameron Spencer/Getty ImagesGenge has also been in touch with Jones recently with the former England head coach offering encouragement, particularly around his ball-carrying. It is his set-piece work that Genge believes has seen the most improvement of late, however, attributing a weight gain of 12kg to his progress.“I texted Eddie the other day,” said Genge. “He gave me feedback on my game straight away. He didn’t even acknowledge what I said. I wouldn’t have him any other way. The other boys are good carriers in their own right and I think it’s probably a strength of mine, so instead of thinking about what to do with the ball I’m just taking it forward. I’ve done a reasonably good job of it so hopefully I can keep on doing it.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Sharing stories brings us together and gives us strength.”The Switzerland defender Noelle Maritz said watching the footage had given her goosebumps. Sundhage did not dwell on the fact that Spain went on to win the 2010 World Cup while Switzerland were knocked out in the group stage, focusing on the here and now and describing the game as the biggest of her career.The 65-year-old, who won Euro 84 as a player with Sweden and triumphed at two Olympics when in charge of the United States, said: “It is the biggest game ever [for me].

Aitana Bonmatí’s fifth-minute opener was quickly cancelled out by a freakish Laia Codina own goal from near the centre circle. Alba Redondo restored their lead, Bonmatí struck again and Codina made amends for her error. Jennifer Hermoso then added a fifth, showing Spain’s strength in depth. “We proved we are a team of 23 players,” said Spain’s coach, Jorge Vilda.Spain 5-0 Switzerland, 26 September 2023, CordobaThe world champions were greeted by a record 14,914 fans for their homecoming match at the ​​Nuevo Arcángel stadium. Before kick-off both teams held up a banner reading “Se Acabó (it’s over) Our fight is the global fight” in reference to Spanish football federation president Luis Rubiales’s resignation for forcibly kissing Hermoso on the lips. On the pitch, it was a routine Nations League group win for Spain with Lucía García, Bonmatí (twice), Inma Gabarro and Maite Oroz on the scoresheet.Switzerland 1-7 Spain, 31 October 2023, ZurichSwitzerland suffered their third heavy defeat in as many months to La Roja at Stadion Letzigrund, though this time they managed a consolation from Alayah Pilgrim when trailing 4-0, courtesy of goals from Oihane Hernández, Alexia Putellas (with two) and María Méndez. The substitutes Athenea del Castillo (two) and Oroz added three more to cap off another Nations League thrashing.Ervin AngWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.“The support we have had is impossible do describe,” the Aston Villa defender Maritz said. “We all thought that there would be a good atmosphere at a home tournament … but on this scale? It gives you a lot of energy when you see the fans marching towards the stadium. You saw it at the Finland game – and to be able to share that success with the fans was really something.”Sundhage’s side have improved substantially since the 2-1 loss to Norway, with the midfielder Géraldine Reuteler in outstanding form and the 18-year-old Barcelona forward Sydney Schertenleib coming in to give the attack a new dimension.And now there is real belief. Sundhage said they “will need a bit of luck” to beat Spain but that they could force that luck with the way they play. Maritz was more bullish, saying they would stick to their gameplan and “walk off as winners”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They defend in great numbers and also get a lot of their players into the box to attack. They have very direct players and their midfielders love to keep the ball.

You have to go back more than two decades – to Leeds Rhinos in 2004 – to find the last time a new team won the Grand Final for the first time.There is still a long way to go and there is another team in the shape of the current league leaders, Hull KR, who would fancy ending that wait come October. But right now, it is impossible to argue againstLeigh Leopardsbeing viewed as bona fide title contenders and another who could lift the Super League title aloft for the first time this year.At a time when rugby league has once again closed the door on promotion and relegation between Super League and the Championship, Leigh’s journey is a timely reminder as to how that may not be such a clever idea. Three years ago to the day, they were beating Dewsbury Rams in the second tier on the way to promotion.Dagnall try extends St Helens’ winning run over Leeds and lifts them into thirdRead moreNow, Adrian Lam’s side are deservedly in the mix for a first league title since 1982. This small Lancashire town has been reinvigorated. A month ago, they conceded 50 points against Leeds and with games against Hull KR, Wigan andSt Helenson the horizon, it was easy to wonder if they could fade out of the playoff mix altogether.But wins in all of those games, the latest another statement success here to ensure a first win at St Helens in evermore than 40 years, have propelled them firmly into the picture for a top-two finish come the playoffs. That comes with immense benefits; the opening weekend off, plus a home semi-final to boot.That Leigh are now just one point behind second-placed Wigan and three behind Hull KR is credit to the work Lam and his side have done. Here, they were magnificent from start to finish, with two tries from Joe Ofahengaue capping a measured and outstanding performance.They have all the hallmarks of a champion team. “We’ve worked really hard on performances like that,” Lam admitted post-match. “It’s been a tough month but we’ve been fantastic. We’re so connected as a group, which I love.”Had the Saints made it six wins in succession here, it would have been Paul Wellens’ side in pole position to chase down the top two of Hull KR and Wigan. But this was a backwards step for them, with their attack poor all evening.Harry Robertson’s try in the final seconds was mere consolation, though it did spare them from being nilled at home in the Super League era for the first time. “I thought on the balance of play, Leigh deserved that victory,” Wellens said. “This was a timely reminder that we’ve still got some work to do.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It was a tight, intense affair that felt like a playoff match but whereas the Saints opted to go for tries from their prime attacking penalties, the Leopards kicked for goal on three occasions, and O’Brien converted two of them.The first try always felt as though it would be crucial. And as the game entered the final quarter, Leigh scored it as Ofahengaue cut through on the angle to give O’Brien a simple conversion to make it 10-0. Any sort of response from the Saints was muted, and when Ofahengaue scored his second with five minutes left, there would be no way back.Robertson’s consolation at least spared the Saints from setting one unwanted record, but this was a night all about their opposition and what they could achieve in the months ahead.Explore more on these topicsSuper LeagueRugby leagueLeigh LeopardsSt HelensnewsShareReuse this content"

Although Newcastle have repeatedly reiterated that they are determined to keep their prized centre-forward, and the Anfield board are in advanced negotiations tosign the Eintracht Frankfurt forward Hugo Ekitike, Isak’s thoughts on the future remain unknown.Howe’s dilemma as Newcastle’s Saudi owners can’t ignore case to sell IsakRead more“There’s always going to be noise around a player of Alex’s stature,” said Elanga as, relaxing after a ­morning training session at Newcastle’s camp in Austria, he spoke publicly for the first time since joining from ­Nottingham Forest. “But he’s always staying super-focused. He’s one of the best attackers in the world but he’s aNewcastle Unitedplayer right now.”When, earlier this week, Newcastle made a bid for Ekitike speculation intensified that Isak could be heading for the St James’ Park exit, but the club maintained Howe’s plan was to play the Swede alongside the France Under-21 international. Now the club are exploring, among other options, a potential attempt to recruit Brentford’s Yoane Wissa to alternate between partnering and understudying Isak.Yet with Tottenham also keen on Wissa and some members of Newcastle’s hierarchy concerned that, at 28, the Democratic Republic of the Congo striker would have limited resale value, any transfer is some way from completion.Isak is contracted to Newcastle until 2028 and has, so far, indicated no great enthusiasm for an extended deal, which makes it seem likely he will seek a move next summer at the latest.“Whenever I speak to Alex it’s always about good things,” said Elanga, diplomatically. “About how my family is and how his family is. I always try and focus on the present. But that mentality Alex has shown in training is second to none and I’m looking forward to continuing to train with him.“For me, he’s the best striker in the world and an amazing person as well that I can always rely on to go for advice. He’s always there to help me. I appreciate him a lot.“Alex being here is amazing, so, of course, he played a part in me joining Newcastle but so did having Sandro [Tonali], Bruno [Guimarães], Joelinton and Anthony Gordon. They all played a huge part in me coming here. They have that winning mentality.”Elanga believes “anything is possible” as the Carabao Cup holders prepare for a Champions League campaign. “I want to showcase my talent,” the 23-year-old said. “I’m pacey and direct. I can play on either side, I can play as a striker. I can use both feet. I’ve got lots of weapons.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

What we want to achieve, how we want to play, it’s perfect. What we’re building here is unique and special.

In my life, I’ve never rushed anything. The staff and players here, they all share similar mentalities.”Elanga believes this collective mindset will result in silverware next spring. “With the players and staff here and the addition of Martin Mark from Midtjylland as set-piece coach, we’re really on the right track. I can really sense that feeling of we really want to grab something and win something. Anything’s possible.”Explore more on these topicsNewcastle UnitedTransfer windownewsShareReuse this content"

Álvarez, the richest and most celebrated fighter in contemporary boxing, is convinced that Oleksandr Usyk will beat Dubois at Wembley Stadium for the undisputed heavyweight championship of the world.“It don’t mean nothing me,” Dubois said at Thursday’s press conference when he was asked about Álvarez’s expensive prediction. “It don’t mean shit to me. He’s going to lose his money. From now on I’m just focused.”Daniel Dubois: ‘That first fight against Usyk is behind me – I’m a man of the future’Read moreThe27-year-old Dubois, the IBF champion who wore a utilitarian tracksuit and black baseball cap, suggested that “I’m going to write my own script now”, before adding: “I’ve prepared right. I’m on a different level now. I’m ready to go through whatever I need to on Saturday and take them belts. I’m chasing glory and I’m chasing greatness. This is history-making and I’m going to do a real demolition job. I’m hungry and ready for it.”Dubois is 11 years younger than Usyk – the WBA, WBC and WBO title-holder who was far more nattily dressed in a flowing white gown, white jacket, black shirt and trousers and black Cossack hat – and he addressed their difference in age: “It’s facts. I’m a young lion and I’ve got to take over, be the man and execute him.”Usyk responded with his characteristically light touch. “Listen, I respect this young guy,” he said of Dubois. “He’s motivated but I am too. I’m not an old guy. 38 is not old. We will see on Saturday – it’s God’s will.”The Ukrainian, who has becomesuch a symbol of defiant inspiration to his countryduring the long and bloody onslaught from Russia, pointed out the fight’s deeper resonance for him. “Every time I fight it’s important for me and my team but now it’s very important for my country and for the soldiers, because it is motivation for my people.”Asked if he had been “rattled” by Dubois’ new-found confidence since Usyk defeated him in August 2023, the unbeaten champion looked suitably puzzled. It took a few attempts before he understood the meaning of the word and responded with a smile and a shrug: “No, I not feel.”View image in fullscreenCanelo Álvarez (above) is convinced that Oleksandr Usyk will beat Daniel Dubois on Saturday and has bet $500,000 on that outcome.Photograph: Steve Marcus/Getty ImagesDon Charles, Dubois’ trainer, had tried to goad Usyk by questioning his religious faith at the press conference in April. He was more circumspect this time: “I’ve normally got a lot to say but all the talking has been done. It’s now time for action. Please tune in, those at home, and those in attendance get behind Daniel Dubois. Let’s make history together. Come on. Let’s go.”Usyk responded more cryptically. “Don’t push the horses,” he advised Charles.“Pardon me?” the bewildered trainer replied.“Don’t push the horses.”Charles shook his head. “I need a translator.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Lapin then repeated the exact same mysterious words in English: “Don’t push the horses.”“I think he’s trying to gee you up,” Dubois’ promoter Frank Warren quipped to Charles.Usyk was more clear when asked if he will win by stoppage. “Yeah, I believe this,” he said quietly.Dubois, meanwhile, insisted: “I’m looking forward to the fight. I’m up for it. I feel I’m at the peak of my powers and it’s going to be a great performance.”Theritual face-offwas just as routine as the two men stared into each other’s eyes. Usyk did not blink once before Dubois turned away after 35 seconds to orchestrate, slightly awkwardly, a chant of “Du-bois … Du-bois … Du-bois …”from his backers.He resumed the stare-down for another 10 seconds before walking away with his team.Usyk remained centre-stage, holding three fingers high on both hands, as he silently promised to become an undisputed world champion for a third time, having previously achieved this feat at both cruiserweight and heavyweight. A champion as experienced and hardened as Usyk knows that such performative trifles won’t matter much on fight night. But Álvarez, a serious poker player as well as a gambler and a fighter, will have been pleased that this little game of bluff was won by Usyk.Explore more on these topicsBoxingOleksandr UsykCanelo ÁlvareznewsShareReuse this content"

She specialises in longer, technical events such as the medley and butterfly.Speaking to China’s Xinhua news agency, Yu said: “My age is currently an advantage. I hope to grow and develop more strength in the future.” She added: “I really want to experience the world-class competition.”World Aquatics competition regulations typically require swimmers to be at least 14 years old to compete, unless they achieve qualifying times that meet elite performance standards. Yu met those times, allowing her to bypass the age threshold.Teenage standouts have long been a feature of international swimming. The American Katie Ledecky was 15 when shewon gold in the 800m freestyle at London 2012.Japan’s Kyoko Iwasaki remains the youngest swimmer to win Olympic gold in an individual event, taking the 200m breaststroke title at 14 during the 1992 Barcelona Games.In 2015, Bahrain’sAlzain Tareq competed at the world championships aged 10, though she did not advance past the heats. Since then, qualification standards have been tightened, ensuring that any young swimmer competing at the highest level has met rigorous performance benchmarks.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

One of the three spiritual leaders of the Syrian Druze, Sheikh Hikmat al-Hijri, put out a statement vowing to “respect the peaceful Bedouin clans”.Calls for revenge had begun to circle on social media on Thursday.Syrian security forces initially intervened in Sweida on Monday after a local dispute between Arab Bedouin tribes and Druze fighters escalated into fighting. Druze militias tried to prevent the entry of the Syrian army and attacked them, which led to days of clashes with government forces.TheIsraeli military also intervened, strikingthe Syrian defence ministryheadquarters in Damascus and dozens of Syrian military targets in the south. An Israeli military spokesperson said the strikes were a message to Syria’s president regarding the events in Sweida.At least 516 civilians and fighters were killed in the clashes, according to the UK-based monitor the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. The monitor said at least 86 civilians were killed by government forces and their allies, and that three Bedouin civilians were killed by Druze fighters on Thursday.1:10Israel launches strikes on Damascus as sectarian violence flares in southern Syria – videoSharaa condemned Israel for “wide-scale targeting of civilian and government facilities”. He said the strikes were pushing “matters to a large-scale escalation, except for the effective intervention of American, Arab and Turkish mediation, which saved the region from an unknown fate”.The clashes were the most serious challenge to Damascus’s rule sincea series of massacresin the coastal north-west in March, in which 1,500 mostly Alawite civilians were killed after a foiled attack by remnants of the ousted Assad regime on security forces.The Druze, a religious minority in Syria and the wider Middle East, make up the majority of the population of Sweida province. They have been negotiating with the Islamist-led authorities in Damascus since the fall of Bashar al-Assad in an attempt to achieve autonomy but have yet to reach an agreement that defines their relationship with the new Syrian state.Regional map of Syria, Lebanon and IsraelSome Druze said they felt further estranged from the new authority after the clashes. “I would rather die than be ruled by them. At least I would die with dignity,” said a 25-year-old civil engineer in Sweida, whose two cousins were killed on Tuesday.Other Druze dignitaries, particularly Youssef Jarboua, another of Syria’s three Druze spiritual leaders, have advocated for a more conciliatory approach with Damascus.Sharaa acknowledged abuses against civilians had occurred and said “lawless groups” had committed crimes against them.“We are determined to hold accountable anyone who wronged or harmed our Druze brethren. They are under the protection and responsibility of the state and the law and justice guarantee the rights of all without exception,” he added.View image in fullscreenA woman films ​Syrian demonstrators as they denounce Israeli airstrikes in Damascus.Photograph: Mohammed al-Rifai/EPAThe US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, welcomed the initial ceasefire.

Though Sharaa’s speech said the military would be withdrawing, it made no mention of members of general security, Syria’s equivalent to gendarmes.View image in fullscreenTrump and Rubio speak to Sharaa and other Middle East dignitaries during a meeting in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, in May.Photograph: Bandar al-Jaloud/Saudi Royal Palace/AFP/Getty ImagesFor months, Sweida has been negotiating its place within the new Syrian state, as the minority Druze have deep misgivings about the new authorities. The clashes exposed rifts between the Druze leadership, with Hijri rejecting any forms of cooperation with Damascus.The clashes also threatened to upset months of diplomatic progress between Israel and Syria after Israel struck for the first time in months.Syrian and Israeli officials had recently met in Baku, Azerbaijan, for security coordination discussions, and Syria’s leadership said it could eventually be open for normalisation with its southern neighbour.The clashes provoked anger among the Druze population in Israel. Dozens of Israeli Druze broke through the border fence on Wednesday.The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said the Israeli military was working to help the Druze and urged Israeli Druze citizens not to cross the border.The Israeli military said it was working to safely return civilians who had crossed.Explore more on these topicsSyriaIsraelMiddle East and north AfricaUS foreign policyMarco RubionewsShareReuse this content"

In 1995, Sylvester Stallone played him in a film that underperformed at the box office and received negative reviews. The character was brought back in 2012 and played by Karl Urban in the Alex Garland-scripted Dredd which received stronger notices, but was also a commercial disappointment.The new version is reportedly more faithful to the original comics and will lean into dark humour. The aim is to kick off a new universe that could expand to both the big and small screen.New Zealand-born Waititi won the Oscar for best original screenplay for his second world war comedy Jojo Rabbit and has also directed two Thor sequels.His last film, the fact-based football comedy Next Goal Wins, was a critical and financial failure.

The agreement, signed at the V&A Museum and followed by a meeting at Downing Street, sets out plans for closer cooperation on migration, defence, trade and education, including a framework for school exchanges.Merz said the treaty was overdue. “We had you in the European Union and we thought that was enough … but we are now learning that it’s not enough, so we have to do more,” he said.The proposed trilateral alignment was driven by Berlin, but Starmer signalled clear support for closer cooperation with Germany andFrance, describing the UK’s relationship with Merz’s government as a “statement of our ambition to work ever more closely together”.Merz reiterated his regret about Brexit – “I personally deplore this deeply,” he said – but his call for three-way cooperation revives elements of the “core Europe” vision first proposed by his mentor, Wolfgang Schäuble, in the 1990s. He envisaged a tightly integrated group of European powers leading the continent, though at the time Britain was not included.In the post-Brexit world, Merz and Starmer are positioning the UK as too important to exclude, even without rejoining the EU.As Europe faces renewed threats from Russia and uncertainty over Washington’s future role in Nato, both leaders stressed the need for stronger continental coordination.Merz said the returns agreement signed by the UK and France last week should be expanded into a three-way pact with Germany to mount a more coordinated response to irregular migration. “The cooperation between the United Kingdom and France … has to be complemented by an agreement that we aim to achieve between the three of us: UK, Germany, France,” he said via a translator.“We want to drastically reduce illegal migration in Europe. We are on a good path, but we haven’t reached the target yet.”Starmer confirmed that Germany would amend domestic law to allow authorities to seize boat engines and smuggling components destined for Channel crossings, closing a longstanding enforcement gap.“We’ve discussed this at great length … [The chancellor] is now going to change the law so that we can intervene,” the prime minister said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The agent combines the powers of AI research tools with the ability to take control of web browsers, computer files and software such as spreadsheets and slide decks.It follows the launch of similar “agents” by Google and Anthropic as interest grows in AI models that can handle computer-based tasks by judging which software is best to use and toggling between systems to autonomously complete assignments like drafting travel itineraries or carrying out work research.UK’s £225m AI supercomputer, Isambard-AI, launches in BristolRead more“The hope is that agents are able to bring some real utility to users – to actually do things for them rather than just outputting polished text and sounding impressive,” said Niamh Burns, senior media analyst at Enders Analysis.But Open AI has acknowledged that allowing an AI agent even limited reign over computer systems meant that “with this model there are more risks than with previous models”.While it is intended to help people with everyday tasks, its potential power meansOpenAIhas felt the need to introduce safeguards to ensure no agents enable the creation of biological hazards.“While we don’t have definitive evidence that the model could meaningfully help a novice create severe biological harm,” the company said, “we are exercising caution and implementing the needed safeguards now.”The model has been trained to confirm with the user before it takes any kind of destructive or irreversible action. The company said in a blog: “You’re always in control. ChatGPT requests permission before taking actions of consequence, and you can easily interrupt, take over the browser, or stop tasks at any point.”The launch of the agent also triggered speculation the tech company could hope to earn revenues if the agents guide users to retail checkouts. The OpenAI chief executive, Sam Altman, has previouslysaidit could charge a 2% fee on sales generated through its “deep research” software.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Would there be commercial deals where brands pay to be featured by assistants, or cases where they might feature their own products more than competitors?“These AI companies are under growing pressure to monetise their products, so some version of ads or sponsored placement feels inevitable.”OpenAI said the agent does not include sponsored product recommendations and there are no plans to change that.A demonstration of the software this week showed it being asked to look at a user’s Google calendar, pick a weeknight when they were free between 6pm and 9pm, seek available tables at Italian, sushi or Korean restaurants with ratings of at least 4.3 stars, and give the user some options.The task took between 10 and 15 minutes and, as with a human assistant, the user could interrupt and set the AI agent off in a different direction. Equally the agent can ask the user for clearer instructions.Another key risk is that the agent falls victim to malicious prompts that may be hidden on websites its visits, which could, for example, demand the agent hands over some of the user’s data.OpenAI said it ran multiple safety checks and trained the agent to reject certain suspicious requests including demands for bank transfers. The system will initially be available to users who pay monthly subscriptions to access the “pro”, “plus” and “teams” versions of the model.Explore more on these topicsOpenAIArtificial intelligence (AI)ComputingnewsShareReuse this content"

Trump has also withdrawn the US from the Paris climate accords for the second time, and rolled back Biden-era investments in renewable energies such as solar and wind that are key to weaning the US off fossil fuels in order to curtail climate catastrophe.The US isthe largest historical contributorto the climate crisis, and currently the second worst emitter after China – a country with quadruple the population.Emitting 178 Mt of CO2e would make theUS militaryand its industrial apparatus the 38th largest emitter in the world if it were its own nation – and more than the entire annual carbon footprint of Ethiopia, a country of 135 million people.“Every extra dollar grows the Pentagon’s carbon bootprint – and shrinks the chances for a livable future. With this additional funding from the big beautiful bill, the US’s trillion-dollar war machine will be responsible for more emissions than 138 individual countries,” said Patrick Bigger, lead author and CCI research director.“Supposedly this spending is for national security. But what security is there in more droughts, floods, hurricanes, and rising seas?”“Every dollar of military spending has a climate cost, with procurement decisions being made now risking locking us into decades of emissions through carbon-intensive military equipment,” said Ellie Kinney, climate advocacy coordinator at the Conflict and Environment Observatory (Ceobs).Graph of carbon emissionsThe Pentagon – the US armed forces and Department of Defense (DoD) agencies – is the largest single fossil-fuel consumer in the US, already accounting for about 80% of all government emissions. In 2023, it spent $860bn, generating almost 152Mt of climate pollution through a combination of overseas operations, jet-fuel consumption and domestic base upkeep – as well as emissions from manufacturing the weapons, ships, tanks and planes it operates, according to a previous analysis byTransnational Institute.The 2026 emissions figure uses the same methodology based on military spending, calculating emissions from the Pentagon’s operations and full supply chain from the vast US military-industrial complex.The US currently operates 877 overseas military bases – two and a half times more than the rest of the world combined, according to recentanalysis. A growing share of the Pentagon budget goes to private companies, with more than halfits discretionary spending between 2020 and 2024going to weapons contractors.The Pentagon has long been the world’s largest institutional greenhouse gas emitter. The 2026 $1tn budget will make the total Pentagon carbon footprint equivalent to the annual emissions from 47 coal power plants.Yet the Pentagon’s true climate impact will almost certainly be worse, as the calculation does not include emissions generated from future supplemental funding such as the billions of dollars appropriated separately for military equipment for Israel and Ukraine in recent years.Every megaton of CO2counts, as emissions drive global heating, which is supercharging deadly, destructive and costlyextreme weathersuch as hurricanes, wildfires and drought.The US is already spending nearly $1tn a year on disaster recovery,one recent analysisfound. Next year’s Pentagon emissions will cause $47bn in economic damages including impacts on agriculture, human health and property from extreme weather, according to theEPA social cost of carboncalculator, adjusted to 2025 dollars.The $150bn Pentagon budget top-up is about five times the annual budget allocated to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) in recent years – an agency that Trump has threatened to eliminate entirely.“Amidst a summer of oppressive heat, the Trump administration is dismantling the government’s disaster preparedness and response capabilities. Prioritizing military expansion while underfunding disaster response doesn’t keep communities safe,” said co-author Lorah Steichen, policy manager at CCI.“The $150bn increase to military spending is comparable to the amount needed to fund whole-building, deep-energy retrofits for all the nation’s public housing units – a true investment in human security.”View image in fullscreenTwo M1A1 Abrams tanks and other military vehicles sit guarded on rail cars at a railyard in Washington DC.Photograph: Mark Wilson/Getty ImagesUS military spending and emissions are the highest in the world by a long way. And it is thanks to the US that states are not required to account for military emissions to the UN. In the run-up to the Kyoto protocol, the 1997 international treaty that set binding targets for greenhouse gas reductions, the Pentagon successfully lobbied the Clinton White House to push for a blanket exemption for emissions generated by military fuel use.Still, the total military carbon footprint is estimated at about 5.5% of global emissions– excluding greenhouse gases from conflict and war fighting. This is more than the combined contribution of civilian aviation (2%) and shipping (3%).And the Pentagon has long warned that water scarcity, sea-level rise and desertification in vulnerable regions could lead to political instability and forced migration, framing climate change as a “threat multiplier” to US interests. In 1991, George HW Bush formally acknowledged climate change as a national security threat.In March this year Trump’s defence secretary,Pete Hegseth, wrote on X: “The @DeptofDefense does not do climate change crap. We do training and warfighting.”Hegseth ordered the termination of dozens of climate studies and renewable energy programs at the Pentagon aimed at making the military both more efficient and resilient.The Pentagon did not respond to requests for comment. The 2024 report is no longer on its website.Military spending is rising across the globe, hitting a record $2.7tn in 2024. This military buildup will have catastrophic climate consequences.Kinney from Ceobs said: “We cannot keep ignoring the military’s contribution to the climate crisis – militaries must be transparent about the scale of their emissions and must make serious commitments to reduce their carbon footprint.”Explore more on these topicsClimate crisisGreenhouse gas emissionsUS militaryUS domestic policynewsShareReuse this content"

It is a great shame that some politicians would rather attack the sector instead of seizing the huge potential that it offers.”The Renewable UK trade association said this month that the number of people working in the offshore wind industry had climbed by a quarter in the last two years, from just over 32,000 to nearly 40,000. It estimated that 74,000 to 95,000 people will be needed to meet the government’s goal of quadrupling offshore wind power production by the end of the decade, with the highest numbers of new jobs expected to be created in Scotland, the east of England, and in Yorkshire and the Humber.Ana Musat, the association’s policy director, said: “Every recent opinion poll shows that the vast majority of people support the development of renewable energy.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Previously, this fast-track process was limited to low-risk activities.According to Araújo, this will affect about 90% of licensing procedures in Brazil, including those for mining companies and the vast majority of agricultural activities.“We’re seeing the implosion of Brazil’s environmental licensing system, that is going to become full self-licensing, where a company just clicks a button and the permit gets printed,” said Araújo, who served as president of Brazil’s environmental protection agency, Ibama, from 2016 to 2018.The law also states that agencies responsible for protecting the rights of Indigenous and quilombola communities will only have a say in licensing processes for projects located on officially recognised territories –excluding more than 30% of Indigenous lands and over 80% of quilombola areasthat have been awaiting official titling for years.“Many of these lands are already under dispute or being targeted by exploitative companies,” said Dinamam Tuxá, executive coordinator of the Articulation of Indigenous Peoples of Brazil (Apib), who described the law’s approval as “the legalisation of a process of extermination of Indigenous peoples”.Tuxá says Lula should veto the bill, but recognises that in a predominantly opposition-led congress, the president’s decision is likely to be overturned. “That’s why civil society must remain organised to pressure lawmakers not to overturn the veto,” he said.If the law does come into force, it is likely to trigger a wave of legal challenges, as activists and legal experts argue thatit violates the constitutionand previous rulings by the supreme court.Some activists have criticised Lula’s administration for not doing enough to prevent the bill’s approval, and even for giving it a free pass, asreported by the news outlet Sumaúma. Resistance to the bill was primarily confined to the environment minister, Marina Silva, who described it as “the burial of environmental licensing”.According to the Climate Observatory’s Araújo, the law also creates a major embarrassment for both Brazil and Lula just months before the country isto host Cop30 in the Amazon in November. “This law is a serious setback and will shape how Brazil is viewed by those who see it as a potential environmental leader,” she said.Explore more on these topicsBrazilAmericasIndigenous peoplesLuiz Inácio Lula da SilvaClimate crisisnewsShareReuse this content"

AI also consumes vast resources, resulting in IT companies scrabbling to secure electricity supplies in locations around the world.Taxing AI could prove tricky, Tubiana conceded, as companies might try to shift the location of their datacentres. Although there was likely to be “pushback” against taxing cryptocurrencies, particularly from the US, whereDonald Trump is an enthusiastic supporter of the technology, she said central bankers had expressed an interest.“Because we need to regulate it – it’s organised crime sometimes, so you should look at where the money’s coming from, and who is the user,” Tubiana said. The taskforce has assigned a group of experts to examine how this could be achieved.The taskforce has scored an early success in the form of an agreement among some countries to put new charges on business-class and first-class airline tickets, and private jets. France, Spain, Kenya, Barbados, Somalia, Benin, Sierra Leone, and Antigua and Barbuda were the first countries to sign up to the accord announced at the end of June.The French president, Emmanuel Macron, said: “We have to mobilise more and more countries in order for these critical sectors which are benefiting from globalisation to contribute to the financing of this common effort [to combat the climate crisis]. I want to urge all possible countries to join this international framework because it’s absolutely key, and it’s part of our agenda.”Such taxes could raise €147bn (£127bn) a year, if the big economies joined in. The use of private jets increased by almost 50% between 2019 and 2023, and first- and business-class flying recovered more speedily than economy class after the Covid lockdowns. Polls suggest that charging premier-class passengers more would be a popular move.Tubiana said: “When you have your car, you pay tax, and when you fly you don’t pay tax, so there is an element of justice there that resonates.”Countries could impose such taxes without a global agreement, she added. “The aviation tax is not that complicated, because it’s really a sovereign decision.”A potential carbon tax on shipping is also still under discussion, after theInternational Maritime Organization agreed steps towards such a deal in April. A further meeting will take place in October, and Tubiana said she was “reasonably optimistic” a new levy would be decided.The taskforce is also examining options such as a tax on buying shares in the stock market, which could raise as much as €105bn a year without distorting the market, according to research.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Members of the Global Solidarity Levies Task Force and rich countries around the world should act upon this enormous public mandate.”Tubiana, whoguided the Cop21 conference in 2015 at which the Paris agreement was signed, also expressed concern about the direction France was taking in international climate negotiations.Macron has mooted adelay to the European Commission’s proposal of a 90% cut to greenhouse gas emissions by 2040, a target that is supposed to be confirmed by the EU parliament and member states in September before the Cop30 climate summit in Brazil in November.Tubiana said Macron’s new-found hesitation over climate policy was “a very sad story”. She warned that it would backfire and would reduce the chances of a strong outcome forCop30, at which countries must set new emissions goals under the Paris agreement.“How can we ask anybody to do something if we’re not doing it, if we’re not proving that we believe we can decarbonise the economy?” she said. “I hope they will wake up to the bad signals they are giving. It’s really not reasonable to think that delaying action will benefit the economy of France.

It is unclear when they will happen.He is keen to avoid a renewal of the industrial action over pay during which resident doctors hold 11 strikes, totalling 44 days, during 2023 and 2024. Those strikes, and action by otherNHSstaff, forced the health service to cancel about 1.5m appointments and cost it an estimated £1.5bn.The BMA has been seeking a 29% rise for resident doctors – a demand Streeting has called “completely unreasonable” after he gave them a 22% rise last year for 2023/24 and 2024/25. However, today’s talks focused on other issues relating to resident doctors’ working lives, as Streeting has refused to reopen negotiations on the 5.4% pay award for 2025/26 that he has imposed on them.“While we cannot move on pay after a 28.9% pay rise [over the last three years], we are working on areas where we can improve working lives for resident doctors.“Strikes have a serious cost for patients, so I am appealing to the BMA to call them off and instead work together to improve their members’ working conditions and continue rebuilding the NHS,” he added.Streeting is keen to strike a deal with the BMA that would give it enough reasons to call off the strike but without compromising his refusal to give resident doctors more money this year. The Guardiandisclosed on Thursdaythat he is considering offering doctors a new system of “forgiveness” of the student loans built up at medical school, which can be as much as £100,000, as a way of putting more money in their pockets without big annual pay rises.Hospitals have begun rescheduling outpatient appointments and operations that were due to take place during 25-30 July and arranging for senior (consultant) doctors to cover shifts left vacant by striking colleagues. Resident doctors staged 44 days of stoppages during 2023 and 2024.View image in fullscreenThe co-chairs of the British Medical Association resident doctors’ committee, Dr Ross Nieuwoudt and Dr Melissa Ryan, speak after a meeting withWes Streeting.Photograph: Yui Mok/PAHowever, Nieuwoudt warned that there was only a limited opportunity for the talks with Streeting to bear fruit after their “productive” encounter.“We have a very small window of opportunity over the next few days to avert strike action,” he said after the meeting.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We have precious, precious few days in order to make sufficient progress in order to avert strike action. Hopefully we can meet at a pace that is sufficient and reasonable.”Ina recent exchange of letters, Streeting told Ryan and Nieuwoudt that while not budging on this year’s 5.4% rise, he would make other, non-pay-related improvements to their working lives.That includes creating more places for trainees to start training in their chosen branch of medicine and making rotational training – during which early career doctors work in several hospitals – less disruptive.In their reply they emphasised their willingness to meet and talk. But they said there had not been enough progress underLabouron issues such as the NHS’s shortage of places for doctors in training to embark on their specialist training and a new system of “exception reporting” of patient safety incidents.Explore more on these topicsDoctorsIndustrial actionWes StreetingEnglandHealthNHSHealth policynewsShareReuse this content"

Keir Starmer said it was important that teenagers who paid taxes had their say on how the money was spent.The move brings voting age for the whole of the UK to 16. Scotland and Wales have already made the change for Holyrood, Senedd and council elections. It is the biggest change to the franchise since 1969, when the voting age was lowered from 21 to 18.Some Labour MPs are worried the move could backfire and result in a boost in support for more left-leaning parties, while others fear that it could bolster Reform UK, which is growing in support among young men.The Reform leader, Nigel Farage, accused the government of trying to rig the system to allow schools to bias young people with “leftwing prejudice”. But he said Labour would get “the shock of its life” as Reform is intending to appeal to 16- and 17-year-old voters by the next general election.Angela Rayner, the deputy prime minister, played down the concerns within her party, saying she was more worried about the impact of misinformation on voters.“You can’t turn around and say: I don’t like what democracy is going to give so I’m not giving you democracy. That argument is, to me, a cul-de-sac,” she told the Guardian.“What we have to do is engage with people about the importance of democracy and the importance of them exercising their democracy, and our argument of why we’re the right people to do the job.“I’m more concerned about misinformation, fake news, the way people get information from these days, and how that can skewer democracy more so than I am about giving a 16- and 17-year-old the opportunity to exercise their right to vote”.Analysis by the thinktank More in Common found that newly enfranchised teens made up such a small proportion of the electorate that they were unlikely to shift the dial politically at a national level, but in a fragmented political landscape even small changes could have large local effects.Luke Tryl, More in Common’s director, said: “Beyond the electoral impact, the bigger question is whether this change will be popular. The public opposes lowering the voting age by a 48% to 27% margin, and it is not near the top of many Britons’ priorities.”The move fulfils a Labour manifesto promise and gives Britain one of the lowest suffrage ages in the world.In the rest of Europe, just Austria, Malta, the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands have a voting age of 16, while elsewhere in the world some of the few countries to have taken the step include Brazil, Argentina and Cuba.The change was welcomed by electoral reform campaigners, who have been pushing for measures to increase democratic participation. However, the Conservatives said the change was “confusing” given that 16- and 17-year-olds could not legally smoke, drink alcohol or buy a lottery ticket.In a sweeping package of changes, ministers will extend voter ID to include bank and veterans’ cards. There will be tougher new rules toguard against foreign political interferenceand abuse of candidates.The package also appears to be taking steps towards encouraging more voter registration. Although it does not commit to entirely automatic registration, the government said it would move to a system that would reduce the need to fill out details across different government services.On election financing, ministers will close loopholes that could allow foreign money to influence UK elections and there will be a crackdown on illegitimate donations through shell companies and new tests on political donors.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionThe changes were welcomed by campaigners for transparency, but the new rules stop short of imposing caps on political donations. Rayner said they would “strike the right balance”.There will be stronger fines of up to £500,000 for those who break the rules, and any false or misleading declarations will constitute a criminal offence.Political parties will be required to assess companies they are receiving donations from, proving their connection to the UK or Ireland. Companies used for political donations will have to prove they are generating income in these countries. Currently, any UK company can make donations to a political party, regardless of where its money comes from and who its owners are.Some campaigners had called for more sweeping changes after the US billionaire Elon Muskfloated the idea of giving $100m (£75m) to Reform UK– an idea he now appears to have dropped after tensions with Nigel Farage.Musk would not, as a foreign national, be able to donate under the new rules and would have to prove any donation through a UK-based company had UK-generated revenue.“Where there’s foreign influence, people should be able to identify that, as opposed to some sort of ban on donations or picking on a particular individual,” Rayner said.“I think [you need to have] transparency about where that … money comes from, and then the electorate can see that, and can see whether there is a conflict of interest, or where a particular policy is coming from.”There will also be enhanced “know your donor” checks, meaning parties will have to consider the risk of any money coming from illegitimate sources.Another change is toughening the law to stop candidates, campaigners and electoral staff being intimidated, harassed or abused.Finally, the government plans to change the law to ban those found guilty of intimidating or abusing a candidate from standing themselves in future.Explore more on these topicsElectoral reformGeneral electionsYoung peopleLabourElectoral CommissionnewsShareReuse this content"

Borrowers will also be able to complain to the financial ombudsman service if something goes wrong.Sarah Pritchard, the FCA’s deputy chief executive, said the regulator had wanted to police the sector for some time, amid rapid growth in demand for this type of loan.According to the regulator, BNPL lending has grown from £60m in 2017 to more than £13bn in 2024. Now “people can benefit from BNPL while being protected”, said Pritchard.The loans are a way to spread the cost of purchases without paying interest, with the payment option, offered by lenders such as Klarna and Clearpay, regularly popping up at online checkouts.But concerns have been raised that some people could end up taking out loans that they cannot afford to pay back on time, incurring charges. The biggest users of BNPL are adults aged 25-34, with the cohort also skewed to those living in the most deprived areas of the UK.The FCA said BNPL, although unregulated, had entered the mainstream as 10.9 million UK adults had used it at least once in the 12 months to May 2024. Of this group, 1.1 million had a debt of £500 or more outstanding, and 5.3 million owed £50 or more.The FCA intends to make BNPL loans of under £50 subject to new creditworthiness checks. Just over half of these loan agreements involve advances below £50, so ignoring them could leave “borrowers exposed to harm”, it said. Without this scrutiny there is also a risk that “loan stacking” – taking out loans from multiple providers – would not be covered by regulation.Vikki Brownridge, the chief executive of the debt charity StepChange, said that as BNPL was now “as common as using an overdraft” among UK adults, it required “proper” regulation.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Bondi has come under particular attack for appearing to claim earlier in the year that she had a client list of Epstein’s, then declaring last week no such list existed.View image in fullscreenMaga hats burn in an online video.Photograph: X | @ExtremePapistStill, House Republicansvoted twice this weekto block Democratic attempts to force the public release of all Epstein files within 30 days, with onlyone Republican, Ralph Norman of South Carolina, voting in favor.The controversy deepened on Wednesday evening after news that the federal prosecutor Maurene Comey, daughter of former FBI director James Comey, who worked on the criminal cases of both Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, had been fired. The justice department provided no specific reason for her dismissal.As the backlash spirals out of his normally firm grasp on the Maga voter, Trump slammed “foolish Republicans” on Wednesday who he said were helping Democrats by focusing on documents related to Epstein.“Some stupid Republicans and foolish Republicans fall into the net, and so they try and do the Democrats’ work,” Trump said during an Oval Office meeting with the crown prince of Bahrain. “I call it the Epstein hoax. Takes a lot of time and effort. Instead of talking about the great achievements we’ve had … they’re wasting their time with a guy who obviously had some very serious problems, who died three, four years ago.”Close to seven in 10 Americans in a recentReuters/Ipsos pollsaid details around Epstein were being concealed. Sixty-nine per cent said they believed there had been concealment of facts on Epstein’s clients by the federal government, with close to 25% unsure whether facts had been concealed, according to the poll.Epstein was arrested on sex-trafficking charges and is believed to have died by suicide in prison in 2019, according to authorities. His former associate Maxwell was convicted of sex trafficking and is serving a 20-year sentence.Explore more on these topicsJeffrey EpsteinRepublicansDonald TrumpUS politicsMike JohnsonnewsShareReuse this content"

Cristosal quietly got staff and their families out before publicly announcing they were leaving out of fear they could be targeted by the Bukele government.The decision came after its top anti-corruption lawyerRuth López was jailedin May on enrichment charges, which the organisation denies.View image in fullscreenHuman rights lawyer Ruth López, handcuffed, holds a Bible as police escort her out of her court hearing in San Salvador.Photograph: Salvador Melendez/APCristosal’s legal team has supported hundreds of cases alleging the government arbitrarily detained innocent people in its crackdown on gangs, and has unlawfully detained Venezuelans deported from the US. López headed many of those investigations. In a court appearance in June, she appeared shackled and was escorted by police.“They’re not going to silence me, I want a public trial,” she said. “I’m a political prisoner.”For years, the organisation said staff have been followed around by police officers, had their phones tapped by spyware like Pegasus, and been subject to legal attacks and defamation campaigns.But López’s court appearance was the moment that Bullock said he knew they would have to leave the country.At the same time, the government has arrested more critics, while others have quietly fled the country. In late May, El Salvador’s congress passed a “foreign agents” law, championed by the populist president. It resembles legislation implemented by governments in Nicaragua, Venezuela, Russia, Belarus and China to silence and criminalise dissent by exerting pressure on organisations that rely on overseas funding.Bullock said the law would make it easier for the government to criminalise staff and cripple the organisation economically.Cristosal’s flight from the country marks another blow to checks and balances in a country where Bukele has consolidated control of the government. Bullock said no longer being able to work in the country will make it significantly harder for the organisation to continue its legal work, particularly supporting those detained with little access to due process.Explore more on these topicsEl SalvadorAmericasHuman rightsDonald TrumpShareReuse this content"

Moments afterwards, the London-bound plane lost altitude and crashed, killing 241 people on board and 19 people on the ground.The preliminary report, by India’s aviation authority, made no recommendations for action against Boeing, which manufactures the 787 Dreamliner. However, after the report’s release, AirIndiaordered that the locking mechanisms of all fuel control switches – designed to prevent them from being accidentally turned off in-flight – on its Boeing planes be examined as a precautionary measure.On Thursday, an official from Air India confirmed that “inspections have been completed and no issues were found”.According toa report by the Wall Street Journal (WSJ), an early assessment made by US officials indicated that investigators were now focusing on the actions of the plane’s captain, Sumeet Sabharwal, a veteran pilot who it said is believed to have been the one who moved the fuel switches to cut off.The black-box recording is reported to indicate that it was the plane’s first officer, Clive Kunder, who was flying the aircraft during take-off and had questioned why the pilot had moved the fuel switches to cut off. Sabharwal had replied that he had not.The WSJ cited what it said were people familiar with US officials’ early assessment of evidence uncovered in the crash investigation as saying that Kunder, the first officer, had panicked, while the captain had remained calm.The sources cited by the WSJ did not state if the action was believed to be deliberate or accidental. It was reported that US officials believed criminal investigators should also be involved in looking into the incident.The WSJ did not name the sources it interviewed and Indian authorities have not attributed any fault in their preliminary investigation.India’s preliminary report had summarised the exchange between the pilot and the first officer but had not attributed the quotes. A direct transcript of the recorded discussion has not yet been published by officials.The fuel switches were moved back on seconds after, and one of the engines restarted, but it was not enough to reverse the plane’s deceleration. A “mayday, mayday, mayday” message was transmitted to air traffic control before the plane hit the ground, just 32 seconds after it had left the runway.The Federation of Indian Pilots strongly criticised the WSJ report as “baseless”, accusing it of attempting to blame the pilot.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The grey-haired patient urges her psychiatrist for a hug, a cuddle – that, she says, is all she needs to keep at bay the nightmarish visions that haunt her. Yet on her ward at the Esquirol hospital centre inParis, such simple gestures are impossible to come by. “When I asked for a hug,” Laurence laments, “they gave me a jar of yoghurt.”‘I’d be a wreck without it’: the floating daycare centre where Parisians paint, dance and healRead moreThis scene, from Nicolas Philibert’s new documentary At Averroès & Rosa Parks (two sections of the Esquirol hospital centre), is as hard to watch as anything you are likely to see on a cinema screen this year. But it is especially remarkable coming from perhaps theworld’s pre-eminent maker of humanist documentaries. The Frenchman Philibert is one of modern cinema’s great champions of kindness. Aged 74, he has built a career making award-winning observational portraits of places that excel at giving care within a hostile modern world: a southern French school for hearing-impaired people in 1992’s In the Land of the Deaf; museums and the people who dedicate their lives to maintaining the objects inside them in Louvre City (1990) and Animals and More Animals (1995); a single-teacher infant school in the rural Auvergne region in Être et Avoir, his 2001 international breakthrough film.On the Adamant, his 2023 Golden Bear-winning doc about anoccupational therapy centremoored on the river Seine, was Philibertismpar excellence: a film about a place that heals because it lives up to the simple ideal of treating patients as people. Yet its follow-up – which explores where some of the Adamant’s passengers go on their bad days –is a film about a place where healing never seems to take place.“[For] On the Adamant, I filmed a lot of workshops and group meetings,” Philibert says on a video call from Paris. “In At Averroès & Rosa Parks, the atmosphere and architecture is more severe, the space is more constraining. When the patients are in the hospital, they are more vulnerable, they are more in pain, they are overwhelmed by anxieties. Life is a hell. Everyone is locked in their solitude.”View image in fullscreenSevere architecture … At Averroès & Rosa Parks.Photograph: TCD/Prod.DB/AlamyThe film about the floating daycare centre became a crowdpleaser because it managed to portray a potentially forlorn place as something more akin to an elite institution for outsider artists (its name, riffing on that of the English post-punk singer who has been open about his bipolar disorder, is no coincidence). But during the filming Philibert realised: “If I didn’t show that the patients circulate between the boat and less prestigious structures, I wouldn’t be showing reality.” The result is what he calls a “triptych” of three films shot over a 12-month period between April 2021 and 2022, screening for the first time in their entirety in the UK at London’s Bertha DocHouse cinema next weekend.The third of the three films, The Typewriter and Other Headaches (Philibert says they can be watched in any order), is still infused with its director’s typical humanism: following the Adamant’s carers as they visit their patients at home to repair broken typewriters, printers and record players, it shows how broken machines and severed links to the outside world can be fixed.And if we do not see any repair work in At Averroès & Rosa Parks, it’s not for the carers’ lack of trying. Made up entirely of conversations between mental health patients and their psychiatrists, it shows the hospital’s staff display extraordinary empathy in their handling of people with severe conditions. We hear them engage respectfully with Olivier, who is confused about family relations and tells his carers that other people’s daughters are his, and that his grandfather is present at the hospital in the shape of other patients. We see them listen patiently to Noé, who speaks multiple languages, makes art, practises Buddhism, teaches philosophy, but also suffers from “megalomania”, a condition he believes was brought on by swallowing a handful of acid at a trance festival as a teenager.But there is always a lurking sense that these conversations are under strain. One patient, Pascal, tells his carer that great psychiatrists are like Kylian Mbappé, the French footballer known for his clinical finishing: “They get to the point, they sense things.” But when he lists the names of psychiatrists he considers top of his league, he pointedly omits to mention the woman he is talking to, and then phases out of the conversation completely. Laurence’s psychiatrist goes to extreme lengths to assuage her fear that the carers are out to harm her and steal her cigarettes, but she snaps back: “I don’t trust you, I stopped trusting you ages ago. You’re dumb, you’re dumb as shit.” He doesn’t retaliate – there’s a camera rolling, after all – but can’t quite stop the hurt pride from showing on his face.“I really wanted for this second film to be based almost entirely on speech and listening, because these are two things that almost becoming extinct in the psychiatric world,” says Philibert. “Public hospitals inFranceand elsewhere are becoming abandoned by public power. It translates as a deep lack of means, a deep lack of attractiveness. A lot of nurses who work in psychiatry end up leaving because they can carry out their work with dignity less and less.”View image in fullscreenTreating patients as people … On the Adamant.Photograph: © TS Production / LongrideAt the end of the film,we meet Laurence again. Her flowing locks have been trimmed short, and she has bloodied plasters on her fingers and festering burns on her face. In a moment of desperation, we learn, she set herself on fire. I wonder if that last scene comes close to violating one of the principles Philibert’s previous films adhered to: for all his interest in people with mental troubles, he usually goes to some lengths to avoid showing them in their troubled state. Yet his depiction of Laurence could be seen to be using her pain for dramatic effect.Philibert is quick to reassert his ethical guidelines. “My films rest on trust,” he says, adding: “Even if a patient or a carer signs a written authorisation, it doesn’t mean that you’re immune or that legal pursuit isn’t possible if you tarnish the image of a person.” He’s speaking from experience: after Être et Avoir became a breakout hit, the teacher at the heart of the film(unsuccessfully) tried to sue Philibert for a share of the profits, claiming that the film’s success rested entirely on his personality.In Laurence’s case, Philibert insists that she gave her consent before and after the filming, because she perceived his request “a proof of consideration”. “‘You want to film me? Oh, you’re interested in me. Me who is always sidelined, rejected, made invisible.’”Still, it’s fascinating to watch a film-maker discover new emotional timbres in his 70s. When the screen cuts to black at the end, and a jazz-guitar version of Beethoven’s Ode to Joy plays over the credits, it feels like we are encountering a very unlikely emotion for a Philibert film: bitterness. And perhaps he is also allowing his beliefs to shine through more than previously. In the film’s opening scene, when staff and patients watch drone footage of the hospital, Noé comments: “It’s scary, it’s like a prison.” Philibert is fond of quoting his fellow documentarian Frederick Wiseman’s maxim: “If you need to drive home a message, send an email but don’t make a film,” but what is this if not a pointed message about the state of modern French psychiatry?“You know, the world of psychiatry is the realm of the unexpected,” he says. “When you enter, all your certainties are shattered. The madmen reset all your counters to zero. They push you to revise all your diagrams.”On the Adamant, The Typewriter and Other Headaches and At Averroès & Rosa Parks are showing at Bertha DocHouse 26-27 JulyExplore more on these topicsNicolas PhilibertDocumentary filmsFranceMental healthPsychiatryParisEuropeinterviewsShareReuse this content"

I was a young mother and I had my career. I wanted to talk to other female actors who were balancing their life with their art. That’s kind of the exploration of the documentary: how do we do it all? Something always seems to take the back seat. For me, it was hard to put motherhood in the back seat. I remember my daughter’s third birthday. I was supposed to have the day off, but we overshot filming, so I wasn’t going to be able to fly home from Vancouver and I was absolutely devastated.I thought: “This is the most horrible thing. I’m gonna miss my daughter’s birthday. It’s not worth being an actress.” But then her dad flew her up to surprise me. It got me thinking: how do you make sure your marriage doesn’t take a back seat to your career? It reminds me of Michael Powell’s The Red Shoes, where she can’t make that decision between choosing her life or her art, and she ends up dancing in front of a train. So I think I was just exploring that with other women, asking them how they do it, and it ended up being a really great conversation. I’d like to revisit it now.

You can serve it to me at any point on the largest platter you have and I will grab my hooey knife and absurdity fork and start shovelling. But, like any chef, you have to know what you’re doing. You have to make some effort, have the basic ingredients assembled in the right proportions and send it out from the kitchen hot, steaming and looking delicious. Tepid hokum, bland hokum – well, that ain’t no hokum at all.And so to the latestStephen Kingadaptation, this time by Benjamin Cavell and directed by Jack Bender (Lost, From, Under the Dome – the latter another King tale) of the horror master’s 2019 novel The Institute, travelling to our screens under the same name.Luke Ellis (Joe Freeman, the son of Martin Freeman and Amanda Abbington, in his first major role and bringing much to a part that barely wants to allow anything) is a super smart 14-year-old, planning a move to MIT when he is snatched from his home one night and relocated to a shadowy government facility (the institute) deep in the forests of Maine to assist with unspecified but – he is assured – world-saving work. Not just because of his IQ but because of the nascent telekinetic powers he also possesses. What were the odds!You can probably take it from here, but let me do my professional duty. The institute houses an array of youngsters who have demonstrated either telekinetic (TK) or telepathic (TP) abilities in their ordinary lives. No one, as yet, has demonstrated both, and none has our spiky hero’s gift for analysing everything around him and showing the grownups how incredible kids can be, yeah?View image in fullscreenFrom left, Fionn Laird, Mary-Louise Parker, Simone Miller, Viggo Hanvelt and Arlen So are having a better time than the viewers.Photograph: Chris Reardon/APKalisha (Simone Miller) is a TP and keeps kissing Luke – I am not too clear why, but it has something to do with her having had chickenpox, maybe, and wanting to pass it on? God knows. George (Arlen So) is a TK and gets to use up the first episode’s nugatory SFX budget by raising a pool of spilt water into the air as a glistening vertical stream. Nicky (Fionn Laird) is a slightly older inmate who grew up in foster care and is – quite loudly, for such a heavily surveilled facility – sceptical of the authorities’ insistence that the children will have their memories wiped at the end of all this and be returned safely to their unquestioning parents.

Behind the professional facade, she has a self-harm habit and a father with dementia – but, if this is meant to make her less of a cipher than any of the other characters being moved around the cheap, uninspiring sets, it does not work. Ditto the bleak affair she is having with Dr Hendricks (Robert Joy), who is in charge of the research and experimentation programme. Rounding out the staff are Stackhouse (Julian Richings, who is British and bony-faced, so you know he is the real villain of the piece) and the sadistic Tony (Jason Diaz), who actually carries out the tagging, drugging and restraining of the institute’s young captives/lab rats that Hendricks’ programme requires.Outside the facility is the B plot. Good cop and even better guy Tim (Ben Barnes, bringing, like Freeman, the most he can to an unrewarding part) has taken a job with local police as a night knocker (a patrolman who makes sure everything’s locked up and calm) to recover from the trauma of being forced to shoot an armed 16-year-old back in the city. A strange lady keeps warning him about mysteries and untrustworthy townsfolk, but I wonder if anyone will ever take heed and start to wonder what goes on in the heavily fortified concrete building buried in the woods on the outskirts of town?And with that, and the promise that Tim will (eventually – it takes far too long) intersect with the main narrative, the last basic King box is ticked and we can see exactly what happens when you keep the plot but strip out the man’s genius for bringing his characters to life, while building dread at a cellular level. Instead, we get what looks like the torture of children to shock and upset, with some gratuitous references to the Holocaust to make things worse. If you stripped those out and upped the pace, The Institute might have made for some perfectly serviceable fun for the early-adolescent demographic. As things stand, it’s hardly fun at all.The Institute is on MGM+ on Prime Video in the UK and US, and on Stan in Australia.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewStephen KingHorror (TV)reviewsShareReuse this content"

You might want this,’” said Dante. “I’m not sure he knew what the sled was, but he must have had some inkling, or why else would he have asked me?“I was astonished. Since I am a huge fan of the movie, I said, ‘Yeah, I’ll be glad to take it.’”The prop is primarily pine hardwood, with the original paint but signs of both wear and tear on the lot and with a few missing rails, likely donated to the wartime drive for scrap metal.“I’ve had the honour of protecting this piece of cinematic history for decades,” Dante said in a statement released by action house Heritage. “To see Rosebud find a new home – and make history in the process – is both surreal and deeply gratifying. It’s a testament to the enduring power of storytelling.”Dante featured the sled in Explorers, as well as 1989’s The Burbs, Gremlins 2: The New Batch (1990) and an episode of the early 90s series Eerie, Indiana.The exact number of sleds produced for the film is unknown – the auction house says a “few” were made; one sold to Steven Spielberg in 1982 for $60,500 (£45,150) in 1982 and another to an anonymous buyer for $233,000 (£174,000) in 1996.Other sales in the auction include a filming miniature X-wing from The Empire Strikes Back, Indiana Jones’ bullwhip originally given to HRH Prince Charles by Harrison Ford at the royal premiere of Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, and Austin Powers’s green velvet suit.A nude photo of Marilyn Monroe is also available, armour from Ben-Hur and a Ralph Lauren blazer owned by Audrey Hepburn.“This is one of the most important events in entertainment auction history,” said Heritage Auctions executive vice president Joe Maddalena. “These aren’t just props. They’re mythic objects.

He had apparently co-written an autobiographical book as planned, but ultimately decided that he didn’t want to publish it. “It took working on writing a book to make me realize that I’m not all that interested in talking about the past,” he said at the time, “and that the best expression of my life … has been and remains my music.”‘No one understands a woman in her 20s like Billy Joel’: gen z finds solace in anti-hustle anthem ViennaRead moreBilly Joel: And So It Goes, a two-part feature documentary premiering this week onHBO, feels like an attempt to stay true to that same basic ethos while not shying away from Joel’s public and private life over the years. The five-hour project tells Joel’s story, but does so by prioritizing his music, in content and in form. “He has 121 songs in his catalog and we used over 110,” said Jessica Levin, who directed the film with Susan Lacy, describing just how many Joel tunes wound up somewhere in the movie. It’s tempting to study the credits and figure out the unlucky 10 that didn’t make the cut, but in effect it’s all here. There are also a few non-Joel compositions in the film, but the vast majority of the music is his, including some adaptations of his melodies into subtle underscore. “It was a goal of ours to use it as score, not just throw it in,” said Levin. “It’s a testament to the depth and breadth of his catalog that we were able to do that.”More immediately noticeable, And So It Goes follows Joel’s discography with more discipline than a lot of music docs, which tend to lose track of later-period records to focus on more personal ups and downs. This confers a sense of importance on his albums full of working-class story songs, accessible ballads and style-shifting pop. Maybe owing to Joel’s mid-90s retirement from writing pop music, the film gives every album its due, while branching out from his career timeline to delve into more personal stories. Material about his heritage, for example, comes later in the film, rather at the beginning; the narrative more or less begins with him playing music as a young man.At the same time, Joel himself is a part of the movie, despite his previous reluctance to talk about his life. He sat with Lacy for 10 interviews, with nothing off limits. “He said: ‘Just tell the truth,’” said Lacy, who has plenty of experience profiling artists as the creator of the PBS series American Masters; her past HBO projects have gone deep on Steven Spielberg and Jane Fonda. There are still some subjects where it seems like Joel must have stayed, if not mum, perhaps reluctant or uninterested. Whether or not he has resolved his longstanding problems with alcohol, for example, isn’t discussed directly, and a song he released just last year, co-written with a lesser-known songwriter, goes entirely unmentioned. (His more recent health problems came after the interviews.) But there is insight through a deep dive into Joel’s catalog.“Once you’ve seen this film, you’ll never hear Vienna the same way again,” Lacy said of the song that’s become a concert favorite, and that the movie reveals as really about Joel’s mostly absent father. “I knew, no matter how many times he said it wasn’t about his father, it was about his father, and I finally got him to admit it in the last interview,” Lacy said. Levin added: “That song is kind of a sleeper hit. It was not a hit when it came out on [Joel’s commercial smash] The Stranger; it was just a catalog song. And over the years it became more and more resonant with people. That he’s talented enough to write a song like that, that’s actually about something else but has this incredible universal appeal, is really something to behold.”Managing to highlight deeper cuts such as Vienna and the title song (which, Lacy said, she didn’t realize was Joel’s favorite of his when she chose the title) is especially impressive given the sheer percentage of Joel’s songs that have made the US top 40 chart. With 33 such entries, more than a quarter of his total output as a solo artist has been a hit single. That’s contributed to his reputation in some corners as a classic panderer, rather than a more considered album artist. That’s less prevalent in today’s more poptimistic environment, but shifting historical perception about Joel’s work was still a goal for And So It Goes. Lacy described the film-makers’ intent as “to make a film that would satisfy and appeal to the fans, but also the people who would say ‘why Billy Joel?’” At the movie’s best, Lacy and Levin seem like they’re able to fit into both categories, even if they’re not as skeptical as the latter. They both obviously love and respect Joel’s music, but they’re able to communicate the “why” of his work through the observations of others.View image in fullscreenBilly Joel performing in 2024.Photograph: Kevin Mazur/Getty ImagesIn fact, some of the doc’s best observations come not from Joel but his ex-wife Elizabeth Weber, who also served as his manager early on. “In the beginning, she didn’t want to talk about the songs,” Lacy said, characterizing her as more focused on the business side that she was so involved in, and perhaps reluctant to say more after a long silence about all matters Joel. But eventually she did speak on the many songs seemingly written about her, whether the wedding staple Just the Way You Are or the spikier Stiletto (which she says, if anything, describes Joel more accurately). That song was also sampled by rapper Nas in his song Disciple, which is why he was originally contacted to join figures such as Paul McCartney and Bruce Springsteen. “We started to pursue Nas because Billy’s music has been sampled a lot in rap. But he started to speak about the other songs and how his father loved New York State of Mind, and we ended up getting rid of the rap [material],” Levin said, including Nas’s more in-depth appreciation instead. “He brought a poetry to it,” Lacy said.Though other observers and artists such as Pink (who knows Joel personally) discuss Joel’s retirement from songwriting, as does Joel himself, it feels more like an event from the past than a present-day condition, even as hints of more songs or a new album fail to materialize. The documentary’s ultimate ellipsis is the open question of whether he might write and record in a serious way again someday, and continue that increasingly respected discography. Lacy and Levin would love to hear more from him, too. But they understand why it remains an open question. “That’s a survival mechanism,” Levin said. “He does live in the moment.”And So It Goes: Billy Joel premieres on HBO on 18 July with the second installment on 25 JulyExplore more on these topicsBilly JoelDocumentaryFactual TVTelevisionHBOPop and rockfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s a Cool Britannia time-capsule written and directed by Justin Kerrigan, starring John Simm, Shaun Parkes, Lorraine Pilkington, Nicola Reynolds and a cherubic young Danny Dyer making his movie debut. Dyer’s character ends up down the pub moodily swearing off drugs for ever – and if we wondered how that was going to turn out, we can flashforward to his performance this year inNick Love’s Marching Powder, in which he does much the same thing.Human Traffic revolves around a group of gurning mates: a classic 90s ensemble of mononymous characters – Jip, Koop, Lulu, Nina and Moff – individually introduced in freeze-frame voiceover in that distinctive 90s Britmovie style, as popularised by Danny Boyle’s Trainspotting and Guy Ritchie’s Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels. But those films were from Mars and this one is from Venus. It’s a sweeter story of the loved-up. They struggle through terrible jobs in the week and prepare for a massive night out on a Friday involving landlines, smoking indoors, proto-Ali G characters, no smartphones, no social media and some cameos from Howard Marks, Carl Cox and Andrew Lincoln (in those days an icon for his role in TV’sThis Life).It’s a comedy, with some very funny stuff from Dyer when his character has drug-induced epiphanies about Star Wars. There’s a reference in the opening credits todemonstrations against the anti-rave Criminal Justice and Public Order Act of 1994, but these are otherwise remarkably apolitical characters, whose ideology consists in being cheerfully pro-drugs, pro-hedonism and pro-having a laugh. Yet a weird earnestness comes through so often;at the time, criticsmocked this film’s fantasy scene in which the young people stand up to sing their alternative “national anthem” about how mixed up and alienated they feel: “We’re running out of new ideas … Who is the Queen?” Now, it feels like a striking and interestingly surreal moment.How we made Human Traffic: ‘The first question I asked in the auditions was: have you ever taken drugs?’Read moreI’d also forgotten that Jip’s mother is supposed to be a sex worker. In another type of film, that fact simply would not be allowed to pass without some terrible crisis, or some consequent tearful and cathartic bonding between mother and son. Jip is also supposed to be suffering from erectile dysfunction and he is secretly in love with Lorraine Pilkington’s Lulu, but none of that is supposed to be anything to do with his mum who is basically cheerful about everything. Human Traffic is a reminder of that interesting 90s moment when euphoria and uncomplicated fun had cultural cachet. Now we need a rerelease of that other one-crazy-night ensemble drug comedy from 1999,Doug Liman’s Go, starring the formidable Sarah Polley.Human Traffic is in UK cinemas from 16 July and on 4K UHD and Blu-ray from 21 July.Explore more on these topicsFilmComedy filmsDance musicClub cultureJohn SimmDanny DyerAndrew LincolnreviewsShareReuse this content"

The teenage James Olaloye, as he was then, is on the streets of Lewisham, the south-east London borough where he grew up. He is “rolling up a blunt, scheming for the funds … trying to come up off the roads on my own two / I never had a father”. Inevitably, this means he’s up to no good: “Making money off a phone … a key’s what they want.”It’s a familiar scenario in the world of UK rap, a genre in which you seldom want for bleak descriptions of the life its stars have left behind on often deprived council estates. But in the case of Father, it comes with a small, but striking detail. “On the block,” he attests, “I was listening to Mitski.”View image in fullscreenJim Legxacy: Black British MusicThe self-examining sad-girl alt-pop ofMitskiis an intriguing accompaniment for the lifestyle he’s describing. But in Jim Legxacy’s case, it makes sense. His rise has been a deeply unorthodox one, buoyed up by music that suggests he is almost entirely uninterested in the way things are usually done. You would broadly have described his 2021 mixtape Citadel as UK rap, but it sounded like UK rap that was fraying at the edges: the backing tracks frequently unravelling; his aggressive flow occasionally dropping out of the mix entirely, or suddenly scrambled until unintelligible. His contemptuous boasts were abruptly disrupted by guitar-driven tracks on which the mask slipped and he sang, in a sweet, plaintive voice, lyrics expressing a strikingly raw vulnerability that seemed to have more to do with emo than hip-hop. In 2023, Homeless N*gga Pop Music leaned even further into the latter mode. Featuring more singing than rapping, it pitched grumbling electric guitars against chattering Afrobeats-inspired rhythms and Miley Cyrus samples, the overall mood heartbroken and despairing. It really didn’t sound like anything else, including Sprinter, the huge hit single Legxacy co-wrote and co-produced for Central Cee and Dave the same year.You might expect his debut mixtape for an actual label to be even more heartsore and introspective, not least because the first track, Context, details what has happened to Legxacy since Homeless N*gga Pop Music’s release: his sister died, his mother suffered two strokes, his track Candy Reign (!) was removed from streaming services after a copyright dispute. These events clearly have an impact on the record. But the adversity seems to have spurred him on. Black British Music is brighter, poppier, bolder in its stylistic leaps, lurching without warning from idiosyncratic pop R&B – laced with sped-up vocal samples that inevitably evoke Kanye West’s early “chipmunk soul” productions – to the alt-rock of ’06 Wayne Rooney. The song New David Bowie tempers a series of head-scrambling musical jump cuts with a succession of nagging hooks.Jim Legxacy: Father – videoIt feels like the work of someone who has grown up with the all-you-can-eat buffet of streaming as standard, hurling contrasting ideas and inspirations at you in a way that recalls someone continually pressing fast-forward in a state of excitement. There are booming, distorted beats worthy of the Chemical Brothers, a hint of Frank Ocean about Legxacy’s vocals, staccato strings on SOS, bedroom pop on Dexters Phone Call, the latter a collaboration with singer-songwriter Dexter in the Newsagent. It’s a risky approach. That it doesn’t result in an annoying mess comes down to Legxacy’s skills as a producer, which allow him to weave it all into something coherent, and to his songwriting. He turns out to be far more adept at nagging melodies than you might have thought given the hazier approach of his previous mixtapes. There’s often something unplaceable and confounding about the results: the cascade of keyboards, vintage soul samples, restless beats and panicked-sounding rapping on the amazingly titled I Just Banged a Snus in Canada Water contrives to be thrillingly intense and euphorically poppy at the same time.The best albums of 2025 so farRead moreA voiceover regularly booms out between and even during tracks, telling you how wonderful the music you’re listening to is: “Somebody tell that bastard to turn that mediocre bullshit off – we’re listening to Jim Legxacy now.” It’s surplus to requirements: a unique world constructed out of an array of musical fragments, the mixtape doesn’t need cheerleading. But perhaps Legxacy does. “I’ve always been scared of being myself,” he sings over the acoustic guitars and scraping strings of Issues of Trust. Without wishing to minimise the difficulties he’s overcome – or indeed what he has to say about Black masculinity, a regular theme in his work – you hear that line amid Black British Music’s giddy rush of sound and think: you could have fooled me.This week Alexis listened toJessie Murph – HeroinAn orchestrated ballad that starts out stately, as if Lana Del Rey relocated to the deep south, but then takes off into raw-throated catharsis, to stunning effect.Explore more on these topicsMusicAlexis Petridis's album of the weekRapExperimental musicreviewsShareReuse this content"

Hit Different (2020)A bit of a buried treasure: Hit Different was coolly received on release –SZAceded the song’s hook to guest Ty Dolla $ign – but it deserved better: the Neptunes’ production is beautifully atmospheric, her vocal is fantastic, the lyrics – in which she perplexingly finds a partner sexier when they’re arguing – are great.19. Ice Moon (2013)For a moment early on in her career, it looked as if SZA might become a kind of avant-R&B figurehead. That wasn’t how it panned out, but Ice Moon, the single from her second EP, S, is evidence of where she once seemed to be headed: a poppy, but distinctly psychedelic swirl of blissful vocals and electronics.View image in fullscreenSZA in 2013.18. Prom (2017)Prom might be the most overlooked track on SZA’s debut album. Another painfully drawn saga of insecurity, it’s equipped with a fabulous, incongruously buoyant melody, set to music that underlines the breadth and diversity of SZA’s vision: the clipped beat and guitar owes as much to alt-rock as R&B.17. Time Travel Undone (2012)Her debut EP, See.SZA.Run, has evaded streaming services, but it’s worth seeking out: different to the music that made SZA famous but still great. The supremely spaced-out wash of synths on standout Time Travel Undone explains whythe Guardian compared it tonot just the Weeknd, but the Cocteau Twins.16. TwoAM (2016)A smart take on PartyNextDoor’s hit Come and See Me: SZA takes on the role of the woman on the receiving end of the original’s booty call, slowly realising that her suitor’s only after one thing. It revealed a more straightforward and earthy SZA, but was curiously dropped from the tracklisting of CTRL.15. Terror.Dome (2013)More fabulous left-field arcana from SZA’s early years: Terror.Dome opens with a chunk of dialogue from horror movie Rosemary’s Baby, the perfect complement to the eerie, echo-drenched sound of what follows: sparse synths, booming drums, cooing vocals at odds with the lyrics, in which infatuation has clearly turned to worrying obsession.View image in fullscreenSZA during her Glastonbury festival headlining slot in 2024.Photograph: Joel C Ryan/Invision/AP14. Sweet November (2014)Signed up by Top Dawg Entertainment – the label that gave the world Kendrick Lamar – SZA scored her first hit with Child’s Play, a Chance the Rapper collab from her EP Z. But its real stand out is the deep cut Sweet November: a dreamy delight that samples aMarvin Gaye obscurity.13. Joni ft Don Toliver (2025)Joni had a tortuous gestation: SZA leaked a version online in 2020, fans leaked another in 2023, prompting SZA to announce she wouldn’t release it officially. She changed her mind: a good thing, given how utterly lovely its Joni Mitchell-inspired melody and sample of the late Elliott Smith’s guitar playing sound.12. 20 Something (2017)20 Something draws CTRL to a sombre, soul-bearing conclusion driven by acoustic guitar: SZA’s life’s a mess, she’s alone, fearful of adult responsibilities that she doesn’t feel ready to accept, a situation to which, evidently, millions of fans could relate. It ends, winningly, with a faintly exasperated pep talk from her mum.View image in fullscreenSZA at the Billboard music awards, Los Angeles, 2021.Photograph: Rob Latour/Shutterstock11. Good Days (2020)The first single from SOS suggested things hadn’t improved much emotionally in SZA’s world: the line about “trying to get my mind together before the end of the world” struck a particularly resonant note on release, in the midst of the pandemic. The sparkling, summery prettiness of the music somehow amplifies the gloom.10. Saturn (2024)The deluxe version of SOS, Lana, appended an entire album’s worth of new material to the original: quite why it wasn’t released as an album in its own right is a mystery when the new songs were as good as Saturn, a shimmering ballad that’s the match of anything on the original album.9. Garden (Say It Like Dat) (2017)The brilliance of Garden lies in the tension between the music – trap drums beneath a haze of electronics and vocal samples spiked with euphorically bubbling electronic tones – and the rawness of SZA’s vocal and the emotions it draws: yearning and pleading for emotional reassurance and commitment amid a burst of insecurity.8. I Hate U (2021)One of several songs on SOS in which SZA makes no bones about how aggrieved she feels after a breakup, I Hate U sets its 4am drunk-dialling despair and bile – “It’s shitty of you to make me feel like this!” – to a superb musical backdrop made of equal parts murky lo-fi R&B and smooth yacht rock.7. Snooze (2022)SZA: Snooze – videoSnooze came in two, equally great versions – the original is classic R&B that would have been a hit at any point in the last 30 years (“aunties approve of its authenticity,” as one critic put it); the acoustic version is woozily dreamy and features Justin Bieber. Both are poignant, confessional and softly powerful.6. Kendrick Lamar – All the Stars ft SZA (2018)Just a guest appearance, but let’s bend the rules a little: this surprisingly slick contribution to the Black Panther soundtrack is worth it. It’s theoretically Kendrick’s show, but it gifts SZA an absolute monster of a chorus, which she totally nails: they feel like equal partners, which is quite some feat.5. Drew Barrymore (2017)The point which you might suggest SZA as we now know her came into being, Drew Barrymore is direct, relatable and witty – “with her mom jeans and her new Vans, she’s perfect and I hate her” – and musically striking: spare beats, twanging guitar. The titular movie star was apparently impressed.4. Nobody Gets Me (2022)Performed live while SZA soared above the audience in a boat (!), Nobody Gets Me takes an intriguing route to anthemic ballad territory: it’s alternately crestfallen, raunchy, intimate and subject to some spectacular vocal pyrotechnics. The chorus is key: it’s got a definite slice of Natalie Imbruglia’s Torn in its DNA, but itreallyworks.3. The Weekend (2017)SZA: The Weekend – videoClassic cheating soul – “my man is your man … you like 9 to 5, I’m the weekend” – retooled for today: slow beats, soft synths, a sample from Justin Timberlake’s Set the Mood (Prelude). Calvin Harris’s excellent remix, meanwhile, recasts it as mid-tempo disco. Both versions are great – take your pick.Mud, mess and murder ballads: SZA’s massive success shows that pop fans are craving realness | Shaad D'SouzaRead more2. Kill Bill (2022)Wikipedia describes 2023’s third biggest-selling single as a murder ballad. It is, although that doesn’t capture how engagingly witty its fantasies of offing an ex are – she follows him “at the farmer’s market, with your perfect peach” – amplified by the pure pop sweetness of its chorus.1. Broken Clocks (2017)If you had to pick a song that summed up SZA’s multi-platinum appeal, Broken Clocks would be it. The lyrics exemplify her brand of confessional, no-filter intensity, depicting a life on the brink of chaos: still haunted by the memory of an ex from years ago, not even she can work out how she feels. The music blends R&B classicism with trap beats and a distinct note of chillwave-derived fogginess. Her voice feels powerful and natural: it has an unaffected, almost conversational quality, as if she’s confiding in the listener. And the chorus is superb, built for an audience who know how she feels to howl along to.SZA’s best songs – playlistSpotifyExplore more on these topicsRankedSZAKendrick LamarChance the RapperRapfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Chua – joint winner of the junior Menuhin Competition in 2018, aged 11 – was 15 and 16 when she made these recordings. The framework is conventional – there are no great surprises in the tempos, and she is backed by the modern instruments of the Singapore Symphony Orchestra, who give an energised but refined performance conducted by Hans Graf. So far, so traditional. And yet Chua consistently holds the attention with interpretations that are notably mature: balanced, considered and never trying too hard. The faster movements having a gentle momentum, the slow ones plenty of space; everything Chua plays has a clean, focused tone, an unfailingly elegant turn of phrase and a quiet wit.View image in fullscreenThe artwork for Mozart Violin ConcertosAs well as the five concertos we also get three stand-alone movements, two rondos and an adagio – and, most rewardingly, the Sinfonia Concertante, for which Chua is joined by the violist Ziyu He, anotherMenuhin Competition winner, his mellow-toned lines dovetailing perfectly with hers. Granted, these performances may not stand out dramatically in a very crowded field, but they are certainly worth your time.Allow content provided by a third party?This article includes content hosted onembed.music.apple.com.

Digging deep helped her realise not everything can be fixedLaura SnapesThu 17 Jul 2025 03.00 EDTShareIn January 2023, as flash floods hit Auckland,New Zealand, Oakley Creek was destroyed: trees upturned, bridges ripped out and dragged downstream, the riverbankcollapsed. Like many locals, Liz Stokes, songwriter and guitarist in indie four-piece the Beths, had walked there often during the pandemic. “It’s jarring to see this place that’s never going to be the way it was, the way you remembered it,” she says over video in late June.She catches herself. “I say the creek was destroyed, but the creek did the destroying also. It’s just nature. It was interesting seeing change happen very quickly in real time.”The collapse became the subject of Mosquitoes, a wistful track on the Beths’ fourth album, Straight Line Was a Lie. As Stokes observes the wreckage she concludes: “The current has forgotten how it felt to break the world.” Even before you know the record’s backstory, her delivery imbues those languid creek waters with a sense of defeat, something deeper than just a postcard from her neighbourhood.Over four Beths albums, critics have singled out Stokes’s sensitive observations about anxiety and connection: she perfectly characterised flailing in the aftermath of broken relationships as being an “expert in a dying field”, the title of their last album. On that record’s Knees Deep, she expresses admiration for someone who always jumps feet-first into life while she’s “wading in up to the ankles” and fearing every second (although the whole bandbungee-jumped for the video).‘Intentionally or not, I’ve been putting walls between me and new experiences’The Beths’ magnetism comes from how these former jazz school students make jangly guitar pop as joyful and tender as Stokes’s lyrics are knotted with self-doubt. Pitchfork called their first album, 2018’s Future Me Hates Me “one of the most impressive indie-rock debuts of the year”. The band’s endearing image, including an excellently thorough blog run by bassist Ben Sinclair that documents their tour breakfasts, makes success seem like child’s play.Straight Line Was a Lie represents a levelling up: it’s their first for US label Anti, home to Waxahatchee and MJ Lenderman, heralding a tour of much bigger venues. It’s a long way from their founding pipe dream of playing Auckland’s 250-capacity Whammy Bar. “We’ve had to rewrite some of our pipe dreams so they’re a lot pipe-ier,” says Stokes. “We’re lucky that it’s grown so consistently so far.”View image in fullscreenBusy Lizzie … The Beths appearing at Primavera Sound in Madrid in 2023.Photograph: Mariano Regidor/RedfernsOur time difference means that while I’m drinking a breakfast coffee, Stokes, 34, is having an early-evening White Russian. “I was nervous about this interview,” she admits, “so I made myself a cocktail, but with milk instead of cream.” She is a little shy, talking from the home studio she shares with her bandmate, guitarist Jonathan Pearce, also the band’s producer and her romantic partner of  10 years. (Drummer Tristan Deck completes the band.) Stokes is a born catastrophiser. She has a sort ofyeah duhlaugh: “And you know what? I can’t believe that not everybody sees the world that way!”The title Straight Line Was a Lie encapsulates Stokes’s frustration at realising that life doesn’t always progress in a linear path. Coming out of the pandemic and the acclaim for 2022’s Expert in a Dying Field, she had hit “a real mental low point”. She was dealing with undiagnosed Graves’ disease, which affects the eyes, the thyroid gland and emotional regulation, feeling “depressed and very anxious and falling apart”.Being prescribed antidepressants was life-changing. “The anxiety that had been this constant presence in my brain was just kind of gone,” she says. “I started being able to make routines, the things you’re supposed to do, like exercising. I was like, oh my gosh, all this potential: I think I can fix everything in my life, my family relationships, my health.”Then the medication started to numb her out: “All my pleasures: guilty / Clean slate looking filthy / This year’s gonna kill me,” she sings onnew song No Joy, a perversely upbeat anthem about emotional nothingness. She felt healthy but disconnected, and struggled to write. “There’s a compass that when I write, it’s very instinctual and emotional to follow where the song wants to go,” she says. “It felt like it was uncalibrated, not pointing very strongly in any direction.”Being in a band is an exercise in sustainability. The moment it becomes unsustainable, you can’t do it any moreTo kickstart the engine, she and Pearce went to Los Angeles. Stokes loves living in Auckland and never did the classic “big OE” (overseas experience) that gives young Kiwis a visa to work abroad; she arrived in LA craving the sort of constant cultural stimulation of music, comedy and classic film screenings that’s harder to come by at home. “It made me want to write, and especially when the muscle was in action, it empowered me to want to do something better,” she says.As well as feeling sparked by shows by Drive-By Truckers, Momma and comedians Margaret Cho and John Mulaney, Stokes read books on writing byStephen KingandRobert Caro, and used a typewriter she received as a birthday present from Sinclair to do 10 pages of free-writing every day. Sitting down at the analogue keys “sounds incredibly pretentious”, she says, “but it was really fun. It makes a great sound. I’d be like, well, I have nothing to write about, and so I was digging into memories, emotions and relationships that I don’t think about because they’re very painful. Even now I’m struggling to look at it. It’s why I think this album has gone the way it’s gone, and I’ve been able to write about things that I normally would find too difficult.”View image in fullscreenFuture her loves her … Stokes performing in 2013.Photograph: Tim Mosenfelder/GettyOne of those songs, the moving guitar hymn Mother, Pray for Me, is about Stokes’s mum, who is Indonesian. Stokes was born in Jakarta and the family moved to Auckland when she was four. “I wanted to hurt you for the hurt you made in me,” she sings, wondering if they still have time to forge a connection. Stokes finished the song a year ago and finally played it for her mum the week before we speak. “English is not her first language and that’s part of why our relationship is complicated,” she says. “There’s so much love, but there’s this gulf of understanding between us where we want to connect but we live in these separate planes.”Showing her mum the song didn’t necessarily offer a resolution. “She was just like: ‘It’s very nice that you wrote a song for me’,” says Stokes. “She couldn’t quite parse the lyrics. It’s confusing – I’ve writtez n this thing about what I’m feeling, but it’s made what I’m feeling able to be understood by people like me, rather than by people like my mum. It’s one I’ll keep unpacking, but it was a huge relief to talk to her about it. Like anything, you build these things up in your head to be terrifying or impossible, then they’re actually fine.”Stokes eventually came off antidepressants to a newly confronting understanding: you can’t actually fix everything. Her Graves’ disease is medically regulated “but it affects you emotionally even once your thyroid numbers are under control,” she says. “There’s always going to be that kind of anxiety and depression – I’m reckoning with the fact that that’s maybe not going to ever go back to the way it used to be.” Counter to the prevailing culture of optimisation that insists life can be hacked to perfection, she realised that “everything is kind of maintenance. That sounds depressing but I don’t think it is. Why is maintenance so unsexy? It’s what you do for things that you love and you want to keep right, and I want to keep being me, so I have to keep on top of that.”In April, Stokes and Pearce returned to LA, in part for Stokes to play a rare solo gig at storied music and comedy venue Largo (where Aimee Mann and Fiona Apple evolved their craft). “We’ve done hundreds of Beths shows, but I’ve done like three solo shows,” she says. “For me, music feels like it’s something you do with other people. That’s what I would tell myself, but I was also really scared of just doing something for myself. I reached a point where I was like, OK, because you’re scared, you should probably do it.”The best albums of 2025 so farRead moreThe show went great, though Stokes is gearing up to tour with her bandmates – her best friends – come September. “You have to work at it, but we’re lucky to have each other, and we all understand that being in a band is an exercise in sustainability,” she says. “The moment it becomes unsustainable, you can’t do it any more. So we have to keep communicating and making sure everyone’s OK.”She credits Pearce in particular with helping to pull her out of her shell. On new album highlight Til My Heart Stops she yearns for him to help her live with reckless joy. “I’m sure a lot of people feel this, but I feel like I’m looking at the world as if I’m stuck behind something, like I’m not part of it,” she says. “Intentionally or unintentionally, I’m putting out walls between me and other people and new experiences. I want to be living in the world, I want someone to yank me out. I want to yank myself out.”Straight Line Was a Lie will be releasedon29 August.

Suffering from disorders ranging from post-partum depression to chronic anxiety to anorexia, the residents of the “sleep room” were sedated and woken only to be washed, fed or subjected to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). All were under the supervision of psychiatrist William Sargant, who at the time was hailed as a pioneer. Sargant claimed that a combination of enforced narcosis and ECT could fix disturbed minds. Failing that, the treatment would be surgical lobotomy.The Sleep Room is author Jon Stock’s gripping account of a scandal in which female patients were denied dignity and agency by a man who wieldedabsolute power over their bodies. The book is ably narrated by actors Richard Armitage, Antonia Beamish and Celia Imrie. The latter’s contributions are unusually personal since, at 14, Imrie had been hospitalised with anorexia and was put under Sargant’s care.In her remarkable and haunting testimony, Imrie remembers Sargant as “tall with an evil presence”. Though she doesn’t believe she had electro-shock treatment, she witnessed a woman in a neighbouring bed going through it, recalling a “huge rubber plug jammed between her teeth; the strange, almost silent cry, like a sigh of pain, she made as her tormented body shuddered and jerked; the scent of burning hair and flesh”.Stock’s book paints a grim picture of the medical establishment’s attitude to mental illness. Sargant’s ward was finally closed in 1973. In the weeks before that happened, he destroyed most of the case records. He was never investigated and died in 1988 with his reputation intact.Available via Little, Brown, 11hr 48minFurther listeningBookishLucy Mangan,Penguin Audio, 6hr 59minThe Guardian’s TV critic reads her memoir in which she looks back at a life shaped by literature.My Next BreathJeremy Renner, Simon & Schuster Audio, 6hr 35minThe American Hustle actor’s memoir recalls his accident in 2023 when he was crushed by a snow plough, leading to surgery and months of rehabilitation.Explore more on these topicsPsychiatryAudiobook of the weekAudiobooksWomenreviewsShareReuse this content"

One guest complimented her on how well she was looking, concluding that “life in Ravensbrück was not nearly as terrible as we’ve been told”. De Renty stared at the woman for a moment, before explaining icily that a typical day in the camp began by stepping over the corpses of friends who had died in the night. They would probably have no eyes, she added, since the rats had already eaten them. And with that, the comtesse stood up and swept out.Ravensbrück always had a credibility issue, explains Lynne Olson in this consistently thoughtful book. The camp, although only 50 miles north of Berlin, had been liberated late, which gave the SS plenty of time to burn incriminating records. There was limited visual evidence, too, since no cameramen accompanied the Soviet army when it knocked down the gates on 30 April 1945. While images from Auschwitz and Dachau of starving prisoners and rotting corpses were flashed before a horrified world, Ravensbrück left little trace in the moral imagination.The camp – which, unusually, was single sex – is better known now, thanks in part to Sarah Helm’s outstanding 2015 bookIf This Is a Woman. Helm not only drew on new documentary evidence that became available with the fall of the iron curtain, but also interviewed many of Ravensbrück’s elderly survivors. Olson, by contrast, focuses on just one small subgroup, the handful of French resistance members who arrived from 1942 onwards. She follows them from arrest, deportation and internment right through to the distinctive and coordinated way that they lobbied for recognition and reparations after the war.Ravensbrück had been built to house 3,000 women, but at its peak held more than 45,000 Jews, Roma, and other groups considered enemies by the Third Reich. There was one latrine per 200 prisoners. Medical intervention was more likely to kill than save and minor ailments quickly escalated into matters of life and death. One woman with a tooth abscess died of septicaemia within a few days. Over a period of six years, around 40,000 women lost their lives through starvation, disease, torture, medical experiments and, from December 1944, a gas chamber that the SS hurriedly installed, having underestimated how long it would take to work everyone to death at the nearby Siemens factory.Even before they arrived at Ravensbrück, therésistanteshad been designated by the Germans as falling under theNacht und Nebel[night and fog] decree, political prisoners targeted for disappearance. Olson shows how the Frenchwomen turned this vaporous status to their advantage, flitting from block to block under cover of darkness to deliver medicine, tapping out messages along pipes and orchestrating strikes in munitions factories. They specialised, too, in a certain Gallic insouciance, delighting in subverting the heavy-footed Germans without letting on exactly how it had been done.View image in fullscreenGermaine Tillion in 1972Photograph: STF/AFP/Getty ImagesBut they knew too that their indeterminate status would make it doubly difficult to explain to the postwar world what they had been through. To be believed, they needed to find a way of documenting their experience. Step forwardGermaine Tillion, an ethnologist who had completed years of PhD study on the Berbers of Algeria before having her notes confiscated when she was arrested at the Gare de Lyon in 1942.Deported to Ravensbrück, Tillion embarked on an anthropological study of camp life. She noted the names of guards, dates of transports and details of gas chamber “selections”, carefully disguising her data as recipes for dishes she might cook in happier times. Dispersing her notes among trusted friends, Tillion reassembled her material after the war, publishing her seminal work, Ravensbrück, in 1946 and adding to it as she unearthed new sources. The final updated version appeared in 1988.Tellingly, Tillion could not find a French publisher for her book – it came out under a Swiss imprint – due to that country’s reluctance to confront its own war record and high levels of collaboration. In the face of this wilful amnesia, the women of Ravensbrück founded the National Association of Former Female Deportees and Internees of the Resistance (ADIR) through which they lobbied for housing, healthcare and employment for survivors. It is this phase that gives Olson’s account of the “Ravensbrück Sisterhood” its satisfying final act.The ADIR’s biggest task was to ensure that the thousands of SS officials, guards and others who had worked at Ravensbrück were brought to justice: of the 38 men and women put on trial, 19 were executed, with the rest given either prison sentences or acquitted. As ever, lack of documentary evidence was the sticking point: oral testimony, though compelling, could easily be dismissed by defence barristers as “hearsay”. Furious at what they considered a gross miscarriage of justice, therésistantescontinued to push for prosecutions despite a diminishing appetite in the culture at large.In 1950, Ravensbrück’s former commandant Fritz Suhren was finally arrested while working as a waiter in a Berlin beer cellar. This time, Tillion’s contemporaneous notes were allowed to be read at trial, and she was able to show that the wretched Suhren, who claimed to have had nothing to do with the gassing of inmates, had indeed signed an order for the execution of 500 women on 6 April 1945. On 12 June 1950 he faced a firing squad.The Sisterhood of Ravensbrück: How an Intrepid Band of Frenchwomen Resisted the Nazis in Hitler’s All-Female Concentration Camp by Lynne Olson is published by Scribe (£22).

The cast have American accents and could be high-schoolers clicking their fingers, despite the period dress. The drama archly positions club-land beats and contemporary phraseology (“cool”, “totally” “my social anxiety …”) alongside choral sounds and medieval monasticism. It is light on historical detail, heavy on humour and attitude.So it makes sense to cast two Netflix stars in this very modern spin on the Italian saints: Clare is played by Arsema Thomas, known for her TV role inQueen Charlotte(the Bridgerton spin-off) while Shadow and Bone actor, Freddy Carter, is the priggishly earnest Francis.Atik’s play, which won multiple awards in America, dramatises the conversion of Clare, an Italian noblewoman inspired by her friendship with Francis of Assisi to found an order following a rule of strict poverty. Here she is as kick-ass as they come, with an immaculate stage debut from Thomas, who plays the part straight up and sharp, despite the eyebrow-raised wit of the enterprise.View image in fullscreenPriggishly earnest … Freddy Carter as Francis of Assisi in Poor Clare.Photograph: Ellie KurttzBut beneath the surface glibness there is lean, clever writing with short, sharp scenes and clean direction by Blanche McIntyre as the play travels towards its serious preoccupations with wealth, poverty and inequality.Clare, with her order of Poor Ladies, was anything but poor at the outset. She renounced all her wealth after meeting Francis and embraced radical poverty (her order, until recently, were still instructed to walk barefoot). Francis, meanwhile, is mocked, gently, as a young man rebelling against his silk merchant father. He slowly becomes more moderate, it seems, and Clare all the more radical.The unfussy, single statement set (a bed, a chair, a bare tiled floor) is designed by Eleanor Bull, who also dreams up some gorgeously regal period costumes. It is suffused in warm, pointed light by Oliver Fenwick.There are some great scenes of bristling sisterhood between Clare and younger sis, Beatrice (Anushka Chakravarti, cutely brattish), as well as gossiping sessions between Clare and her two lady’s maids (Liz Kettle and Jacoba Williams).“Can you spare any change, please?” says a beggar who Clare and Beatrice mistake for a heap of rubbish. This hammers home the fact that this is both about 13th-century poverty and our own. But there is potency in the heavy-handedness: the play is not trying to hide the fact that inequality then is recognisable, and unchanged, today.There are intelligent conversations about it that resonates loudly for today – Francis speaks of how the rich must necessarily turn a blind eye to poverty because it implicates them, by its existence.The ending speaks of the modern world and all the ways in which the gulf between rich and poor is shored up. It should jar but instead leaves you prickled, roused, impressed by the singularity of Clare’s resolve – and awkwardly implicated yourself.AtOrange Tree theatre, London, until 9 AugustExplore more on these topicsTheatreComedyReligionreviewsShareReuse this content"

Now 81 years old – and ahead of a UK show – the spiky-haired artist recounts a career spent on the fringesChristian HouseThu 17 Jul 2025 05.57 EDTShareWhen the Chilean photographer Paz Errázuriz showed her first photobook to a well-known society photographer of the day, he told her “look, a housewife will never be a photographer”.“That’s what he said!” she laughs. “Imagine … that was my beginning.” Today, aged 81, her work documenting life on the fringes of Chilean society sits in the collections of Tate Modern and MoMA in New York and in 2015 she represented Chile at the Venice Biennale.Between 1982 and 1987, Errázuriz spent time photographing life in the brothels of Santiago, as trans sex workers fixed their hair, shifted their stockings, refined their makeup and killed time waiting for male clients. It was, she says, a “beautiful” experience. “We talked or we’d have a glass of wine or a coffee. They trusted me.”View image in fullscreenFighting spirit … Black Demon by Paz Errázuriz.Photograph: © Paz Errázuriz. Colecciones Fundación MapfreSuch was her empathetic bond with her subjects, that she even developed a friendship with the mother of two brothers working in one of the brothels. “I dedicated the series to her.” She titled the project Adam’s Apple,and it characterised a career defined by an enduring love of outsiders.Works from the series can now be seen in her first major solo UK exhibition,Paz Errázuriz: Dare to Look – Hidden Realities of Chileat MK Gallery in Milton Keynes. Other subjects of the 171 photographs on show include psychiatric patients, circus performers, boxers, political activists and the homeless, highlighting the humanity of those living under duress during the military dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet.Talking to me over Zoom from her home in Santiago, Errázuriz admits to being nervous about the interview. But she remains an energising presence, even on screen: a huge smile and rippling laugh, spiky hair, she beams through my laptop like a grandmotherly punk.“My idea is not to shock,” she states. But shock she did. “I was censored for such a long time. For instance, there was a small group exhibition at a museum during the dictatorship and my photograph was taken out. It was a reflection of a naked man in a mirror.” It was artistic, she laughs again, not obscene. “You couldn’t see anything specific.”Errázuriz was born in Santiago in 1944. Her father, a lawyer, was both strict and traditional. “I never got along with him. He didn’t accept that I studied art when I finished school, so I resented that,” she recalls. A childhood snap taken during her first communion made an impression about photography’s importance as a record. Her head was partly out of the frame. “I was frustrated because friends had very formal photographs. It seemed very unfair.”She trained as a primary school teacher, studying for a time at the Cambridge Institute of Education in the UK. While teaching in Santiago she began taking pictures, initially of children. “I enjoyed that very much because they didn’t see me. They forgot about the photographer,” she recalls. That project led to her first photobook in 1973 – Amalia, Diary of a Chicken – in which she depicted a household seen through the bird’s shin-high perspective.She was encouraged in her early work by the book’s editor, Isabel Allende, later the bestselling author of The House of the Spirits and a niece of Salvador Allende, Chile’s president during the early 1970s. “I didn’t know other photographers. I never had the chance to see photobooks in those days. I’m self-taught.”View image in fullscreenForgotten … Home of the Elderly by Paz Errázuriz.Photograph: © Paz Errázuriz. Colecciones Fundación MapfreBut everything changed on 11 September 1973 when General Pinochet took power in a coup that saw the country’s air force bomb its own presidential palace. When Pinochet’s troops stormed the building, President Allende was found dead, lying next to his rifle. Isabel Allende went into exile.Errázuriz stayed. But the coup ended her teaching career; the junta considered her “inappropriate” for the classroom.Photographyand family life took its place. She married and had two children. Meanwhile, she began photographing Chileans living on the margins of society, embracing an informal social documentary style with a humanist sensibility. “Little by little, I became more active.”They said: ‘Oh no, you cannot come in because women are not allowed here’In 1981 she co-founded Asociación de Fotógrafos Independientes, which provided credentials and a membership card as she wielded her camera around town. She went on to photograph vagrants sleeping rough, elderly nudes, riot police, tango dancers, wrestlers, acrobats, dissidents and endangered ethnic groups. All are treated with respect.Errázuriz compares looking at her old work to flicking through a diary. “It was analogue photography and so you had negatives and you made contact sheets. Film here was very difficult to find, very expensive. You had one roll of film, 36 shots, and when that contact sheet appeared there were so many things on it,” she explains. “The first six strips were of the protests in the street, where the military is doing this or that. Then came the photography of my son, a baby, and then at the end of the sheet is my grandmother’s birthday.”In the 1980s, Errázuriz volunteered at a charitable centre for people affected by Aids. The crisis decimated the community of sex workers she had photographed. “So many people died. From my project all of them except one,” she says, adding that she remains close to that survivor. “For the past 10 years, the first call I receive in the new year is from him.”View image in fullscreenLike a grandmotherly punk … photographer Paz ErrázurizThe dictatorship was mercurial, she recalls. In 1987 she began documenting the city’s boxing community. “That, I thought was innocuous,” she says. “But when I went to the place where they trained, they said: ‘Oh no, you cannot come in because women are not allowed here.’” She won them over with “imaginative arguments”.The last time she showed in the UK it was alongside other international luminaries such as Bruce Davidson, Diane Arbus and Larry Clark in the group showAnother Kind of Life: Photography on the Margins at the Barbican in London. She is thrilled to be back in Britain, a nation of which she is fond, not least because, when Pinochet was placed under house arrest in a Surrey country club in 1998 on charges of human rights violations, “everyone realised, seriously, what he had done because England is such an authority,” she says. “That was the real fall of a dictator.” He told Chileans he’d be home for Christmas but was held for 16 months before, notoriously, the then homesecretary Jack Straw released him on the grounds that he was too ill to stand trial.Errázuriz is still photographing (albeit on her smartphone, as carrying a camera on the streets of Santiago would be a magnet for muggers). There is widespread poverty, crime and yet more protests, she says, and she is not, perhaps, as primed for the latter as she once was. “You have to run fast. The teargas hurts so much, I discovered that the gas today is totally different to the one 40 years ago.”Does she think Chile is a better place today than it was half a century ago? “We got rid of the dictatorship. That was the main thing we’ve done. That’s really important,” she says. “But it’s difficult in Chile, really. It’s not exactly what we dreamed of.” When I ask if she still gets pleasure from photographing its people, “Sí,” she says and her face lights up. “When I choose who I’m going to photograph, it’s because, somehow, I like that person. I reflect myself in them. I learn from them.”Paz Errázuriz: Dare to Look – Hidden Realities of Chileis at MK Gallery from 19 July to 5 OctoberExplore more on these topicsPhotographyChileAmericasTransgenderfeaturesShareReuse this content"

When Bloomberg planned its European headquarters it incorporated the ancient Roman Temple of Mithras in a basement, displaying finds made during the pre-construction dig in a gallery that also shows contemporary art. Now Newcastle-born twins Jane and Louise Wilson have taken a long hard look at four of those finds, wooden posts or stakes that are about 2,000 years old. It’s thought they supported an ancient crossing over the River Walbrook. Are they Roman, or even pre-Roman?Part of their response appears as a surreal swarming world they depict under two escalators outside another City landmark, the Leadenhall Building – AKA the Cheesegrater (the rest is in a simultaneous free exhibition at Bloomberg Space). The Wilsons have plastered prints on the undersides of its entrance escalators bubbling with brews of sinister life that look like multiple eyes or frogspawn. In fact, these clouds of watery mutants are vastly enlarged images of the microscopic creatures that they saw, with the help of Danish and British archaeologists, inside the four Walbrook crossing posts.View image in fullscreenLike stakes to kill vampires … Jane and Louise Wilson with the four Walbrook crossing posts.Photograph: Jason AldenThe Wilson sisters’ graffiti-like invasion of the Cheesegrater’s cool, rational plaza is easily the most enticing new artwork in this summer’sSculpturein the City, a free festival of public art amid some of the most expensive real estate on Earth. Clearly it is not a sculpture, but the positioning of their double “mural” underneath the metallic escalators works in their favour. The biological festering of these alien-looking entities evokes the secret organic world in the ground beneath us, just as their artwork skulks below the glossy Cheesegrater.It’s called Dendrophiles – “tree lovers” in Latin. You probably thought folk horror came from the country, but this part of London is full of ancient echoes of ritual and disease, death and decay beneath its towering icons of cash.View image in fullscreenA triffidian life form … Looping Loop by Andrew Sabin.Photograph: Nick Turpin/Copyright the artist, Courtesy of the artist and Brooke BeningtonBoth the other new commissions for Sculpture in the City also delve into tangled vegetative worlds.Ai Weiweishows a cast iron replica of Brazilian tree roots on the slightly sinister grassed-over plague pit that is the churchyard of St Botolph without Bishopsgate. It’s disappointingly unnoticeable in this setting. That’s the trouble with public sculpture: to pass all the demands of landowners, local government and churches it often has to have its edge effaced to fit. Andrew Sabin resists this by plonking his tentacular sculpture of a triffidian life form in the middle of a pavement where it is hard to ignore.The demands of sculpting for the City, with all these corporations watching you from their eyries, must be arduous. Alongside the three new pieces, are works by Julian Opie, Maya Rose Edwards and more remaining in place from previous years. It’s a nice enough excuse for a London walk. But it was Jane and Louise Wilson’s Dendrophiles that grabbed me and lured me to their exhibition at Bloomberg Space.View image in fullscreenRitual … a still from Performance of Entrapment by Jane and Louise Wilson.Photograph: © Jane and Louise WilsonHere DNA spirals, monsters and beading, bubbling water proliferate in a kind of archaeological nightclub. An abyss-like, circular mirror reflects flashing lights.

Audiences travel to a purpose-built auditorium inside an engine shed at Oxenhope station. It is a delightful mood-setter to Mike Kenny’s adaptation of E Nesbit’s 1905 novel, whichpremiered in 2008. It is back on the road, this time chugging its way along the same five-mile line comprising the Keighley and Worth Valley Railway on which the Green Dragon travelled in Lionel Jeffries’ iconic 1970 film.Inside the shed, the impressive stagecraft arrests the senses over the story of Roberta (Farah Ashraf), Peter (Raj Digva) and Phyllis (Jessica Kaur), the children forced out of their well-to-do London home and into a shambling house by the tracks in Yorkshire, after their father (Paul Hawkyard) is wrongly imprisoned.View image in fullscreenCheery … The Railway Children at Keighley & Worth Valley Railway.Photograph: Bradford 2025They take to waving at passengers on the Green Dragon, an invisible locomotive here conjured through a wonderful concoction of steam, sounds (designed by Craig Vear) and crackles of light (designed by Richard G Jones). That is, until a real-life steam train enters the auditorium – a sight to behold.Scenes on Joanna Scotcher’s stupendous set design are deftly executed on mobile platforms. It gives the period dress production a heady sense of motion as the children take off on their adventures. But for all these excitements, it is initially too tame in its storytelling and anodyne in its emotional drama. A framing device in which adult versions of Roberta, Peter and Phyllis reflect back on their childhood selves, and enact the story in retrospect, feels under-used.Conceived and directed by Damian Cruden, the children are Anglo-Indian; their father met their mother (Asha Kingsley) in the British Raj. It is an interesting twist, rather like that inlast year’sproduction ofThe Secret Garden. But little is done with this introduced theme of imperialism and mixed heritage identity beyond the cosmetic: Mother wears an ethnic shawl; one of the children dreams of having an elephant.The siblings speak in cheery tones and appear more like a reduced version of the Famous Five than young people trying to turn their pain into resilience. It is all a little chocolate-box – a quintessential, idealised version of Englishness.Thankfully, it is brought back on track after the interval. The humour sparks alive and there are charming meta flourishes to the siblings’ memories.“You’ll have to use your imaginations for this part,” Roberta implores us at one point, and later we become the waving strangers on the train. It shines in these collaborative moments. The emotional life of the play gains weight, too, however schmaltzy the story may be. By the time the final scene comes round, with Father’s return, this show has become irresistible.At Keighley & Worth Valley Railway, until 7 September.Explore more on these topicsTheatreChildren's theatreFamilyreviewsShareReuse this content"

Nobody says it how it is quite like her, whether she’s talking about how she “hated” her mother, tried to kill her sister or cheated on her four ex-husbands. The former TV executive, newspaper editor, author and Loose Women regular is now going on the road with a one-woman show called Off the Leash. To be fair, she’s never been on it. Street-Porter’s website heralds her as “the nation’s favourite pissed-off pensioner” and promises that, with the new show, “in the words of her good friend Elton … ‘the bitch is back!’”We meet at a restaurant she has booked in west London. When I get there, she’s already perusing the menu and eavesdropping on the couple behind us. “That man behind us is very irritating,” she stage-whispers. “He’s giving this woman advice about making friends.” My back is to him. What does he look like, I ask. She sticks two fingers down her throat and makes a gagging noise.Street-Porter, 78, has been famous for ever. She is one of the giants of British media, and has always stood out – a loud-mouthed, working-class woman in an urbane, upper-middle-class men’s world; an aesthete with a love of pop culture and opera, often dismissed as a philistine because she was born with neither silver spoon nor plum in her mouth.Of course I drink alcohol, Simon. The world has not stopped turning on its axisThe young Janet Bull (Street-Porter is her first husband’s surname) was bright, swotty and rebellious. She grew up in Fulham, London. Her mother was a dinner-lady and her father an engineer. When, one day, her father announced they were moving to the suburban hell of Perivale, she regarded it as the ultimate betrayal and never forgave her parents.She worked hard and plotted her escape. Street-Porter was in her second year studying architecture when she discovered journalism. She quit the degree and got a job working on a fashion magazine. By her early 20s, she was deputy fashion editor at the Daily Mail. Fast-forward a few years and she was presenting youth TV shows (thereafter known as “yoof” because of her pronunciation). By her 40s, she was a TV exec, commissioning groundbreaking shows such as comedy classic Red Dwarf and the music/current affairs mash-up Network 7 for Channel 4. In her 50s, she became the editor of the Independent on Sunday.View image in fullscreenStreet-Porter in 1973.Photograph: Ronald Dumont/Getty ImagesEven those who didn’t give a hoot about media or telly recognised Street-Porter because she was relentlessly parodied by Spitting Image; all teeth, specs and estuary English. The caricatures were both cruel and celebratory – a reflection of her outlandish qualities and a tribute to her huge success.Were her parents proud when she achieved so much at such a young age? “No. They were outraged I worked for the Daily Mail!” What would have been their paper of choice? “Reynold’s News, the Co-op newspaper. That would have been my dad’s. He would have wanted me to work for a leftwing newspaper. I don’t know what my mother’s choice would have been because we didn’t have that conversation.”Both her parents were married to other people when she was conceived. It was only after her father died, she says, that she discovered the truth. “I didn’t know either of them had been married before till my dad died. And then I only knew my mother had been married before – and they weren’t married when they had me.” She’s still furious that her mother took those secrets to the grave. “I still don’t know how my mum met someone she actually married that I didn’t know about.”How old were you when your father died?“About 40.”And how long did your mother live for after he died?“Six years.”You’re so outspoken, it’s surprising that you didn’t simply ask your mother about it, I say.She looks at me, astonished. “Well, we wouldn’t have had that conversation because I never had a conversation with her my entire life.” She tells me it was the kind of house where she didn’t speak unless spoken to.Her mother was beyond the pale, she says, and tells a story to illustrate the point. She would take her walking in north Wales as a child and tell her a lake they passed was deep and dangerous. Decades later, Street-Porter discovered the lake was only about 3ft deep. Maybe she made a mistake, I suggest. “You mean my mother telling me that a Welsh lake was super deep and scary was a mistake?” she fumes. I’m only giving her the benefit of the doubt, I say. “Oh, I’ve never given my mother the benefit of the doubt.”View image in fullscreenL-R: Bob Geldof, Street-Porter and Tony James of Sigue Sigue Sputnik, in about 1986.Photograph: Dave Hogan/Hulton Archive/Getty ImagesThe waitress approaches.“Can you tell me something? Last week or the week before, did you have a duck salad?”“No, but we have burrata with parma ham and figs,” the waitress says.“No it was duck,” Street-Porter insists. She scans the menu again. “I’ll have the club Cobb salad, and the alcohol-free beer.” She turns back to me. “‘I read in the Mail last week that non-alcoholic beer is bad for you. Apparently, its crime is it’s got calories and sugar.” She hoots with laughter.Does she not drink alcohol these days? “Of course I drink alcohol, Simon. The world has not stopped turning on its axis. I don’t drink at lunchtime. I don’t think I could.”The waitress returns with the beer in a glass tankard. Street-Porter stares at it in horror. “Can I have it in a normal glass, please? It doesn’t have to be cold, just not a tankard.”She’s still thinking about childhood mealtimes. “We got punished if we didn’t eat butter beans.” What was the worst punishment? “Oh, you’d get hit! Mum hit us with the hairbrush.” Did her father hit her? “I don’t remember Dad hitting. But he’d say things like, ‘I’m going to wipe that expression right off your face.’” Didn’t all dads say that back then? She gives me another look. “So, you’re thinking I’ve exaggerated?” No, I say, I just think it was a common expression.“My sister and I didn’t get on very well either,” she says. Well, you did say in your memoir that you tried to kill her. “Only in a stupid childlike way. Pushing her down the stairs.” She admits she was jealous of her. “My sister had nice dark-brown hair and a bubbly personality whereas I was a moody bitch. I was reading my books, thinking I had the wrong parents and not communicating with either of them.”She says she became closer to her sister after their father died. “The circumstances were so extraordinary. He died in the Canary Islands and my mother just rang up and said, ‘He’s dead!’”She comes to a sudden stop. “I just don’t get where this is going. Do you think my book is just a collection of fairy stories?” Not at all, I say, I was just surprised you never asked your mother about her first marriage when it was obviously important to you. Hmph, she says.View image in fullscreenAt a party with Courtney Love in 2003.Photograph: Alan Davidson/ShutterstockWe move on to her brilliant career. She tells me she turned up to her first day of work at the Mail in knitted shorts, a furry jacket and platform boots. “I had a right attitude. But that was the right thing to do because they were in awe of you. They weren’t going to treat you like some little piece of fluff.” She pauses. “It was so tough to get on, not using the tricks you could use.” What tricks? “The bimbo factor. I’m very proud of my career, which I achieved entirely on merit. Not just my outrageous ambition, but my determination. I was very single-minded.”She says some people were determined to do her down. “It culminated in a newspaper saying I’d only done well because I was having an affair with a senior executive. It wasrubbish.” Did it ever make her want to get out? “God, no! I thought, ‘Fuck this, I’m not leaving.’ I’ve clawed my way up the pyramid of power to senior executive at the BBC. You don’t get that far by shagging someone. There was also a lot of backstabbing. And a lot of manoeuvring.”Who backstabbed you? “Who knows? Who cares? I wouldn’t be bothered. I’d be doing it to other people – you’d expect it. In any corporation, whether a newspaper or the BBC, there’s only so much money. And the only way you’re going to make the best stuff is getting someone else’s stuff cancelled. It’s not to get further up the pyramid, it’s to do better stuff that makes more impact.”She was in charge of 250 people and managed a budget of £30m at the BBC. In 1994, after eight years, she left and made the “really stupid mistake” of going to the short-lived TV channel L!VE TV!. Why did she leave the BBC? “Because I didn’t become controller of BBC2.” How annoyed was she about that? “Totally and utterly.”She has often talked about the two abortions she had in her teens, the first on a stranger’s kitchen table at the age of 16. Does she think her career would have been different if she’d had children? “I definitely wouldn’t have achieved as much. At times, I think how old they would be now. I think it was the right thing to happen at the time. It just shows how ruthless I was. I was not going to let anything stand in my way.”These days, Street-Porter is best known for being on Loose Women, which she joined in 2011. In May, ITV announced the show’s run would be reduced from 52 weeks a year to 30. “I don’t agree with how they’ve done the cuts,” she says. Does she know if she will keep her job? “Oh, IknowI’m going to keep that job. Don’t waste your bloody time trying to get a scoop on that.”View image in fullscreenWith fellow Loose Women panellists (L-R) Ruth Langsford, Coleen Nolan and Brenda Edwards.Photograph: ITV/Ray Burmiston/ShutterstockShe says Loose Women fulfils a unique function. “Women come up to me all the time. The issues we talk about resonate with them, whether it’s relationships or domestic abuse.” And, she says, the programme also holds politicians to account. “Obviously, during the last election campaign, I decided toconfront Rishi Sunak about freezing the tax threshold. Well, it scuppered his campaign, didn’t it?”It’s interesting that she refers to her younger self as a “moody bitch” and is promoting the one-woman show as “the bitch is back”. Has she always regarded herself this way? “Well, I have been bitchy.” What’s the bitchiest thing you’ve done? She looks daggers at me. “This is going to be a real hatchet job, isn’t it?” I’m only asking because that’s the word you use. “Well, I’m getting a vibe,” she says. “OK, I’m bitchy in a fun way. Not heavy-duty. A lot of it is banter.”I ask if she’ll be talking about the men in her life in the show. “No, I never said that.” Sorry, I say, I assumed you would be because the promotional material says: “Now she finds herself with a senior railcard and four ex-husbands.” “Oh well, all right. It’s not right, it’s not wrong, it’s not finalised.”She has been with her partner, the former restaurateur Peter Spanton, for 26 years. Is this your longest relationship? “Probably.” Is it a good relationship? “What do you define good as? It’s survived. I’m not bored.” Who’s been the best man in your life? “The thing is, when all new relationships start, you get very involved with someone, and then you go back to work! My biggest relationship has always been with my work. I couldn’t stand not working.”View image in fullscreenWalking in North Yorkshire.Photograph: Steve Morgan/AlamyShe checks the time and says she’s got to be off. There’s still loads to talk about, I say.“Well, Simon, I’m going in five minutes.”“Can I ring you and finish the interview later?”“No. I’m not giving you my number. You’ll pass it on. You’ll be like the producers of Newsnight and This Morning.”“Do you really think I’ve got nothing better to do with my life than ring Janet Street-Porter every minute?” I ask.“You might get really pissed off with me and just ring and hang up. So, is the Guardian doing a picture?” She answers her own question. “Yes, they are. Will it go on the front? I hope so. To go and put myself through this … Right. I’m leaving you the bill for my salad. Thank you very much.”Street-Porter says she thought I’d be asking her more about her life now. “I feel very strongly that the old must not be referred to in a negative, diminishing way and, if I can do one thing, it’s celebrate getting old and being a pensioner and carrying on living life to the full. It might not be life to the full to a twentysomething TikToker, but it’s perfectly brilliant by my standards and certainly a damn sight more exciting than my mum’s standards. So when you asked me about my mum and dad, I did get a bit testy back then because I think, ‘No, let’s talk about my life now.’”Anne Reid on fame, desire and ambition at 90: ‘The most wonderful things have happened since I was 68!’Read moreI’m a bit confused. The thing is, Janet, I say, you were the one who kept going back to your mum and dad. “Oh no I didn’t. Anyway, you can say what you like. But, for me, that episode is part of my show because I like to explain to people how I’ve ended up like this and those are my roots and they are pretty weird. And I’ve still not sorted them out. I think that’s clear from talking to you. I might get defensive when you go, ‘Well, why didn’t you ask them?’ because I can’t answer that!”I was just curious, I say. “You can see how defensive I get because I’m thinking, well, whydidn’tI ask them.” She says she was more concerned at the time that her pet terrapin (Terry) had been stolen.Perhaps you were too self-absorbed? “Totally.” And now? “The same. Exactly. Self-absorbed.Myworld!” And for the first time she shows an ability to laugh at herself. “Iaminterested in other people,” she says, trying to row back a little bit. But she knows she’s fighting a losing battle. “Simon, I’m interested when I’m interested.” She stands up. “I’m not going now because I’m not interested, by the way. I’m going now because it’s 3.40pm and I’ve got a driver waiting for me.”As she heads off, I ask how she’d describe herself to somebody who has never met her. “Unexpected!” That’s a copout, I say. “Good fun!” A final pause. “When she’s in the mood.

This emphasis on communities rather than large-scale centralised development tied in withthe broad theme that David saw as running through his work: “The importance of human-scale institutions over centralised ones, human imagination over dull rationalism, and the human spirit over technocratic reduction.”Funny Money: In Search of Alternative Cash (1999) explored local economic systems found mainly on a journey through the US. Exchanging services within community systems run by volunteers can be facilitated through “time banks”. The idea of the “time dollar”, representing one hour of help, whether grocery shopping or preparing a tax return, was popularised by the Washington law professorEdgar Cahn.Hesaw the principle as akin to a blood bankor a babysitting club: “Help a neighbour and then, when you need it, a neighbour – most likely a different one – will help you.”David pursued these ideas through the work of theNew Economics Foundation, formed in 1986 out of The Other Economic Summit, a body providing a critical shadow to G7 summits to promote radical economic perspectives and voices from the global south.The NEF aims to transform the economyso that it works for people and the planet.From 1987 to 2010, David wasthe editor of the magazines and newspapersproduced by the NEFand his work there also included establishing a UK network of time banks. By2008 he and Martin Simon, the chief executive of Timebanking UK, were able to produce the reportThe New Wealth of Time, showing how the multiplier effect of strangers pooling their efforts could extend to improving public services through organisations.View image in fullscreenThe Tyranny of Numbers, 2001, by David BoyleThis drew on another idea important to David: co-production, with one hour from an unemployed single parent, for instance, counting for as much as one from a surgeon or other professional. The principle could be applied in mental and physical health – such as theRushey Green Time Bankdeveloped by GPs in Lewisham, south-east London – services for young people and older people, regeneration, housing and social justice.David believed that whenever something is wrong, it is probably too big. He applied his analysis of scale, inhuman and remote organisations to both the state and markets in books including The Tyranny of Numbers (2001);Authenticity(2003), rejecting the corporate and fake in favour of the local and real; two written with Andrew Simms, The New Economics (2009) and Eminent Corporations (2010); The Human Element (2011); Broke: Who Killed the Middle Classes? (2013); and Tickbox (2020), pointing to the pitfalls of dehumanising decision making.The Money Changers: Currency Reform from Aristotle to E-Cash(2002) was a collection he edited viewing money in various ways as a changeable means to an end, in line with John Ruskin’s observation that “There is no wealth but life.”In 2012-13 David led the government inquiryBarriers to Choice, examining access to healthcare, social care and education. His central finding was that: “Although people welcome choice in the services they use, there is a minority of people who – for a variety of reasons – are excluded from those benefits, often because they lack the confidence, the information, or the advice that they need.”The Guardian applauded itfor “pulling the issue away from the old market v state argument and reframing choice as an issue of user power”. David identified in practical detail what could make systems work better for disadvantaged people.In 2013 he set up theNew Weather Institutethinktank with me and Simms to promote a rapid transition to a fair economy that can thrive within planetary ecological boundaries.Born in Paddington, central London,David was the son of Diana (nee Evelegh), who became a magistrate, and Richard Boyle, an investment banker. An ancestor was Sir John Lubbock, the first Lord Avebury, the Liberal politician who introduced the Bank Holidays Act 1871.Childhood illness and hospitalisation may have contributed to David’s later sense of drive. He was educated at The Hall school, Hampstead, and Clifton college, Bristol, and gained a degree in philosophy and theology at Trinity College, Oxford (1977-80). His own interest in politics emerged in a wish to align Liberal economic policies with the impossibility of infinite economic growth, and a desire to work with Green politicians.On graduating he became a reporter on the Oxford Star, and went on to edit the Town and Country Planning Journal (1985-88), a pioneering publication that campaigned for planning centred on people and nature.A voice on what from 1988 was theLiberal Democratsnational policy committee, he edited the weekly Liberal Democrat News for six years from 1992 and stood in the 2001 general election.He believed that economic education could empower people, and in 2019 co-authoredEconomics – A Crash Course, a beginners’ guide to heterodox economics, diverse and non-dogmatic, drawing on multiple schools of thought. Quite devoid of ego, he made the discussion of ideas an adventure, and helped make localism a buzzword across all the political parties. Another framework for the exploration of ideas came from his extensive historical writing, with subjects ranging from Caractacus to Alan Turing.Through the imprint that David set up, The Real Press, he published five collections of modern folk tales, niche histories, and fiction. His play Passport to Steyning celebrated the West Sussex town that he lived in declaring independence in the face of global warming, and was performed at the Steyning festival in 2018, with many of the characters playing themselves.Through the NEF he met Sarah Burns, later a textile designer, and they married in 2003. She survives him, along with their sons, Robin and William, his sisters, Fiona, Serena, Kristina and Louisa, and his brother, James.David Courtney Boyle, political economist, environmentalist and writer, born 20 May 1958; died 20 June 2025Explore more on these topicsEconomicsCommunitiesMagazinesNewspapersPlanning policyLiberal DemocratsobituariesShareReuse this content"

As The Angelus comes to the UK, our critic celebrates a painting so deep it could even induce hallucinationsJonathan JonesThu 17 Jul 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 17 Jul 2025 03.54 EDTShareIt wasSalvador Dalíwho turned a small, intense rural scene called The Angelus, painted by Jean-François Millet in 1857-59 and hugely popular in its day, into a totem of modern art.In the original, a pious peasant couple have heard the Angelus bell from a distant church, the Catholic call to prayer, and paused their work digging potatoes to lower their heads and pray. But from Dalí’s writings, we know he saw far more in the painting, from obscene sex to family tragedy. In one of his many versions of it, Atavism at Twilight, the couple sprout agricultural implements from their bodies. In his surreal drawings these good country people become mouldering, mummified husks, or are transformed into fossils by time and sadness. Now that the original painting is being lent by the Musée d’Orsay to theNational Galleryas the star of its forthcoming show Millet: Life on the Land, we will all get a chance to obsess over this innocent-seeming artwork.The Angelus was an instant hit in the 1800s, widely reproduced, while the original passed through a string of private collections for record prices until the Louvre, which first tried to buy it for France in 1889, acquired it in 1910. In 1932 it received perhaps the ultimate fan homage: it was attacked – slashed several times with a penknife. After being repaired, it remained in the Louvre until the Orsay opened in 1986.At an exhibition of Millet’s drawings, Van Gogh told himself: ‘Take off your shoes, for where you are standing is holy ground’Decades ahead of Dalí, Van Gogh also copied it in a fervent 1880 drawing that was one of his first artistic efforts – its untrained clumsiness makes the emotion even more touching. He revered The Angelus as his ideal model of all that art should be and do. In their fascination with Millet’s masterpiece, both these modernist giants show how a work of art can turn into something else in the beholder’s mind. Dalí deliberately induced a state akin to illness in his mind in order to hallucinate upon The Angelus. “The only difference between me and a madman is that I am not mad,” he said. Van Gogh was of course less able to switch it on and off.View image in fullscreen‘His ideal model of all that art should be and do’ … Van Gogh’s 1880 drawing The Angelus (after Millet).Photograph: AlamyVan Gogh was in London, working at the Covent Garden branch of the art dealer Goupil et Fils, when he wrote about its power in one of his earliest letters. “That painting by Millet, L’angelus du soir,” he told his brother Theo in 1874, “that’s it, indeed – that’s magnificent, that’s poetry.” At the age of just 21, five years before he decided to become a painter, the Dutch pastor’s son saw something uniquely poetic in The Angelus.Its creator, Jean-François Millet, was then near the end of his life. Like Bruegel centuries before him, Millet painted rural life so authentically that people thought he was a peasant sharing his world. This was not entirely groundless: he was born into a farming family from Grouchy, near the Channel coast in Normandy. Millet said The Angelus depicted a memory of this childhood: “The idea came to me because I remembered that my grandmother, hearing the church bell ringing while we were working in the fields, always made us stop work to say the Angelus prayer for the poor departed.”Millet was not a naive artist. He trained in Paris with the history painter Paul Delaroche, famed forThe Execution of Lady Jane Grey(1833). But things didn’t go well and he retreated to Cherbourg. He seemed stuck in a career as a local portrait painter.Then, suddenly, he found himself. Millet started painting the hard life of the peasantry. It was a political decision. He had his first hit with The Winnower, a painting of a man shaking a basket of grain, throwing golden specks high in the air so when they fall the wheat will be separated from the chaff. Does that sound allegorical? It surely is, for Millet unveiled this image of a peasant weeding out corrupt bad seeds at the Paris Salon in 1848,the year revolutions convulsed Europe. The paintings that followed are monuments to backbreaking rural work: The Sower; The Gleaners. Millet doesn’t paint the landscape as an idyll but a place where the poor are worked to death.Van Gogh saw Millet’s compassion through a religious lens. Soon after that early letter to Theo he was sacked and, after a spell teaching, tried to become a preacher and missionary to the poor. His family thought he had a religious mania. His fervour included worshipping Millet. When he saw an exhibition of Millet’s drawings, he raved, “I felt like telling myself, take off your shoes, for the place where you are standing is holy ground.”View image in fullscreenThe next chapter … Van Gogh’s Potato Eaters (1885).Photograph: Granger/Historical Picture Archive/AlamyVan Gogh’s debt to Millet is obvious in his early work. In his 1885 drawing Peasant Woman Digging, he gives the digger massive, earthy presence – like Millet’s folk. But his most blatant reference to The Angelus is The Potato Eaters.In Millet’s Angelus, the peasants have taken a break from their arduous toil digging potatoes from the hard earth: we see spuds in their basket and in a bulging sack in their wheelbarrow. Van Gogh’s The Potato Eaters feels like the next chapter. The peasants have gone home to share a humble meal with their family. Van Gogh stakes his claim here to succeed Millet as a peasant painter.But did Van Gogh respond so intensely to The Angelus for reasons that were harder to name than politics or religion? A surrealist would say yes. Dalí would see unnameable insinuations in The Angelus – and being Dalí, name them.For him, this painting was “the most troubling, the most enigmatic, the densest, the richest in unconscious thoughts that has ever been.” Seen through his eyes, The Angelus is less a slice of rustic life, more a kitsch surrealist dreamwork.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toArt WeeklyFree weekly newsletterYour weekly art world round-up, sketching out all the biggest stories, scandals and exhibitionsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The brown lumps of potatoes in the basket look turd-like while the shapeless sack might contain part of a body. The three prongs of the huge fork have been driven into the ground with unwonted violence. If that doesn’t seem phallic enough, the two thick hafts of the wheelbarrow poke from the woman’s skirts. Do these Freudian intimations point to something unspeakable in the figures’ relationship? In Dalí’s Atavism at Twilight, the fork is stuck in the woman’s back: the man dreams of sodomising her. She’s his mum, according to Dalí.View image in fullscreenFreudian intimations … Dalí’s Atavism at Twilight (Obsessional Phenomenon), after The Angelus (1933).Photograph: © 2025 Salvador Dali, Fundació Gala-Salvador Dalí, DACSAlternatively, he suggested, they are the parents of a dead child. Dalí believed that Millet had originally painted a grave in the foreground. You can sort of see it. He persuaded the Louvre to X-ray it and claimed the results confirmed his theory. It haunts his eerie 1965 painting The Perpignan Station, in which the grave becomes a railway track dividing the Angelus couple. Perpignan, the first station in France coming from Spain, and where papers were checked, becomes here a liminal place between life and death.Dalí had enough ideas about The Angelus to fill a book, and they did. He penned The Tragic Myth of Millet’s Angelus in the 1930s, and published it three decades later. It has been hailed as the most ambitious theorisation of what he called his “paranoiac-critical method” in which you hallucinate layers and metamorphoses of an object or image. Did he mean a word of it? Was he really obsessed with The Angelus or did he just enjoy the idea that he was?One piece of evidence his delirium was authentic is the 1929 film he created with Luis Buñuel,Un Chien Andalou, in which a couple stand like the peasants in The Angelus (but with male and female positions reversed) until their love petrifies and they are buried in sand. This film, Dalí’s most spontaneous work of dream art, was made before he went public with his Millet obsession. So The Angelus really was lodged in his psyche. He soon repainted it in his 1933 work Archaeological Reminiscence of Millet’s Angelus, in which the couple become colossal, slowly eroding monuments towering over a desert.Dalí’s lifelong attempts to understand why The Angelus hooked him became a surreal odyssey of sex and death that is a good guide to enjoying a work of art. We should all be a bit paranoiac-critical when we visit an art gallery and let a work of art suggest as many things as come into our minds.I can relate to it because I’m strangely thrilled that Millet’s painting of two French peasants in a flat, bleak landscape with a church spire on the gold and bronze skyline is coming to the National Gallery. The first time I saw it was nowhere near a museum but in a hypermarket in rural France on a camping trip when I was a teenager. There it was, as a cheap print on canvas, this glowing, frozen scene. I had to buy it.Why does art capture us? Sometimes a particular painting just seems to say more than you can express, and stays inside you. This is the mystery of art, and the mystery of The Angelus. I’m not saying what I see in it – I am not sure I want to know, let alone confess it. But it calls me like a bell at twilight.Millet: Life on the Land is atthe National Gallery, London, from 7 August to 19 OctoberExplore more on these topicsPaintingArtExhibitionsNational GallerySalvador DalíVincent van GoghfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The spice rack was supposed to symbolise a new beginning.After the pandemic, I got into making things with wood, and thought the spice rack would be good for the kitchen, but Murad seems to hate it. I do care more than I probably should about it, but it’s because we live in a shared flat with limited space and I genuinely thought the spice rack would be a helpful, practical upgrade. I even bought matching jars and arranged everything thoughtfully.I spilt cumin all over me because he hadn’t put the lid on properly; that was really annoyingI haven’t got around to labelling each jar, but I don’t think it’s a big deal. You can just sniff a spice to work out what it is. My sense of smell is great – maybe Murad is triggered because he can’t smell things as well as me.Instead of using the rack, Murad has taken over our cupboard with shop-bought jars and packets he’s picked up in every shape and size, and it’s chaos. Once, when I opened the cupboard, I had cumin spill all over me because he hadn’t put the lid on properly, and that was really annoying.Murad says we both need to take ownership of the way things are arranged in the shared cupboard, but it wouldn’t have been me who left a jar of cumin hanging off the edge. I think his side of the cupboard is way more chaotic than my spice rack. Murad has created his own junk-shed of random spices, but his just have branded packaging.I get that Murad wants me to label things, but life got busy. Plus, as I made the spice rack, maybe he could help with decanting and labelling? Meanwhile, we could make better use of the shared cupboard space.Our kitchen is small and I don’t think two sets of spices is economical. A flat isn’t just a collection of solo zones, it’s a compromise and requires teamwork. The rack isn’t perfect, but with a little collaboration we could make it better.Thedefence: MuradI want ease and functionality. I don’t want to try to solve a puzzle every time I make a curryI cook almost every night and love to use spices, but Alex’s rack is a mess – it has no labels and no logic, and I don’t have a clue what’s in each jar. I don’t want to try to solve a puzzle every time I make a curry, so I buy my own spices and put them in my section of the shared cupboard.Alex says I’m taking up too much cupboard space and don’t empty my old jars. He also says the spices have fallen on him and spilled everywhere when he’s opened our cupboard, but that’s not my fault as it’s shared, so he can’t blame me for all the organisation.Alex may think it’s fun to live like we are in a Victorian apothecary, but I find it frustratingI actually think he’s hurt that I’m not using his DIY spice rack, but it’s not personal. It just doesn’t have everything I need and it’s not clear what’s what. I prefer shop-bought packaging as it actually has labels. It’s not like I’m buying gold-plated saffron. It’s just basic things that I use regularly.I want to know that when I reach for cumin, I’m getting cumin, not a mystery dust. I don’t want to have to sniff-test every jar. Alex may think it’s fun to live as if we were in a Victorian apothecary, but I think it slows everything down and makes cooking, which I actually enjoy, feel frustrating.I’ve brought this up before and said I’ll clear out my shelf if he tidies up the spice rack. He always says, “Oh, I’ll label them soon.” But the labelling never happens. It’s been months. How long am I meant to wait for the organisation to materialise?I’m happy to share store cupboard staples, but not when it means playing Russian roulette with flavour. Alex needs to get his spice rack in order before I give up my shelf space. At this point, I want ease and functionality, but his spice rack creates chaos and confusion. I cook mainly for myself, but sometimes for Alex too. If he wants delicious, flavourful food he shouldn’t police where I source my spices.The juryof Guardian readersShould Murad use Alex’s spice rack?Labelling the jars would improve their appearance and spare Murad the tedious sniff test routine. In a spirit of collaboration, Murad could source some nice labels and Alex could write on them. If Alex’s sense of smell is as keen as he says, it shouldn’t take long.Kate, 68It takes two to tango in a shared household, and Alex has warmed the new flat with a thoughtful, handmade spice rack. Since labelling is the main issue, would it be too much for Murad to curry some favour by filling the jars and labelling them himself?Patrick, 31As someone who likes cooking and does it a lot, unlabelled jars would annoy me too. It is a nice effort from Alex to have made a spice rack, but surely labelling is not a massive job. Until the jars are labelled, the rack is not strictly finished, as it can’t be used properly.Diana, 32Both need to dial it down. Alex, make some nice labels – it’ll be fun! Murad, if Alex doesn’t label the jars, do it yourself. Masking tape and a Sharpie will do it – it may even spur Alex to upgrade it.L, 46It’s sweet that Alex made the rack but he needs to be less possessive over it. It’s good to live and let live.Anice, 67Now you be the judgeIn our online poll, tell us if you think Murad should get on track with the rack?The poll closes on Wednesday 23 July at 10am BSTLast week’s resultsWe asked whetherLynsey should maintain a separate towels laundry policy89%said yes – Lynsey is guilty11%said no – Lynsey is innocentExplore more on these topicsLife and styleYou be the judgeFoodfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The freedom of heading out on my bike and not knowing where I’m going to pitch my tent that night. Now that my children are aged seven and nine, I wanted to introduce them to the liberation of this kind of adventure. They adore a day out on their bikes, but this was to be our first multiday bike trip as a family of four, so it was crucial to find a route easy and fun enough to captivate them.View image in fullscreenIllustration: Guardian GraphicsTheMaasroutefollows the course of the Maas River as it meanders for 300 miles (484km) through the Netherlands, from the inland city of Maastricht to the Hook of Holland, then loops back to Rotterdam. It forms part of the much longer Meuse cycle route (EuroVelo 19) that stretches from the source of the Maas (or Meuse as it’s known in France) on the Langres plateau, travelling through the French and Belgian Ardennes before crossing into the Netherlands.Our plan was to cycle the 100-mile stretch from Maastricht to Dordrecht over four days, traversing expansive floodplains dotted with castles, windmills and villages of thatched houses, crisscrossing the Maas on charming little ferries and pitching our tent at family-friendly campsites. This being the Netherlands, the terrain is predominantly pancake-flat with protected bike paths and low-traffic roads, making it an ideal first bike trip location for budding cyclists.View image in fullscreenThe medieval Sint Servaasbrug bridge in Maastricht.Photograph: Marc Venema/AlamyFor route planning, we used a foldout Dutch cycling map for perspective and nostalgia, in combination with the essential and freeLF-routes long-distance cycling app. As we were living in Leiden, we took the train to Maastricht and stayed in a hostel overnight. We carried all our camping gear on rented Dutch city bikes in small everyday panniers, with the overflow in a backpack so the children had nothing to haul. The Hook of Holland is on the Maasroute, so it’s possible to bring your own gear and bikes on an overnight voyage across the North Sea from Harwich.We set off from Maastricht in the morning sunshine full of first-day energy and cycled five blocks to Sint Servaasbrug, which is an unmissable seven-arched limestone pedestrian and cycle bridge, built in the 1280s to replace a Roman river crossing. This detour, and a not-so-quick stop at the supermarket for picnic ingredients, made getting out of town hairy. However, we soon found ourselves leaving the city and following reassuringly wide cycle paths out into the idyllic water meadows of Limburg, with the Maas as our constant companion.View image in fullscreenThe pancake-flat terrain and low-traffic roads make the Netherlands ideal for young cyclistsAs the day wore on the heat escalated, so to keep the children on side, we stopped for mango ice lollies followed directly by gelato atTerras Maasoeverat Urmond, a breezy bankside restaurant servingbroodjesandbiertjes(sandwiches and beers) on a terrace overlooking a small river ferry crossing to Belgium.By the time we arrived at our first campsite at theJachthaven de Maasterp, in the picturesque village of Ohé en Laak, we were wilting. Luckily, the marina’sBrasserie Knaag & Codidn’t disappoint, with lakeside views, swimming beaches and playgrounds, so we could cool off and toast the success of the girls’ first 30-mile ride.View image in fullscreenWaiting for a ferry at Ohé en Laak.Photograph: Ralf Liebhold/AlamyThe next morning we set off early, slathered in sun cream and with spirits high, to cross the Maasplassen, a vast network of human-made lakes that has become a popular destination for water sports. It felt as if we were cycling through a Van Gogh painting as an endless parade of sailing boats and sloops cruised by. After a coffee at theGrand Café Aemiliusin Maasbracht – served with a side shot of amaretto and topped with whipped cream – we powered along the straight road to Roermond in the midday sun (I credit the amaretto). Our goal was the aqua park at theLandal de Lommerbergenholiday park where we enjoyed a carefree afternoon racing down slides and plunging into swimming pools.With bedtimes out of the window, we rode the final stretch of that day’s route at 10pm, enjoying the cool evening air. With another 30-mile ride under our belts, we waited in happy silence with two lone night cyclists for the ferry to Kessel, with the backdrop of Kasteel de Keverberg, a hilltop castle that dates back to AD950, on the bank across the river. Giddy from the day’s adventures, we set up our tent among the trees atNatuurcamping en Camperplaats Boezevenin the last of the light.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Remembering the objective of fun with the children rather than mileage, we decided to catch a train from Venlo to Breda. (Fortunately, taking bikes on trains in the Netherlands is straightforward, with dedicated carriages that can take up to four bikes outside weekday rush hours for €7.50 each). Disembarking at Breda, we navigated our way to theBiesbosch national park, Europe’s largest freshwater tidal zone, where our pitch at theKurenpolder campsitein Hank came with a sunset view of the lake.The key to a successful family cycling adventure is to strike the right balance between the hard work of pedalling and relaxation. The next morning we visited theBiesbosch climbing park, where our girls enjoyed a couple of laps around the high ropes course. A win, but it meant delaying our start time. We thought the afternoon would hold an easy cycle ride across the national park, but only a few miles in, my partner Andrew had a total tyre and tube blowout, which required expert help to repair. We had to make Dordrecht that evening, so I pressed ahead with the girls, cycling along the tops of dykes and past an endless stream of vibrant blue and green creeks and willow flood forests. Eventually, Andrew caught up with us at theBiesbosch Museumterrace for a cold drink and the early evening ferry across the river to Dordrecht, the oldest and one of the most picturesque Dutch cities, with a blend of gothic, Renaissance and Dutch golden age architecture.View image in fullscreenFinal destiantion … Dordrecht.Photograph: fokkebok/Getty ImagesStanding on the deck in the breeze, balancing our bikes on that final river crossing, we were low on energy but full of joy and satisfaction. The girls loved the wide bike paths that cut across pristine meadows and the freedom of camping somewhere different each night, but mostly they were exhausted – from days in the sun, pedalling, climbing, swimming and late nights snuggled together as a family in our tent. I liked doing the trip as a family team, and that the girls were learning to take pleasure in doing the gritty, challenging things in life. It will serve them well.‘A muddy ride into Romania’s dreamy countryside’: cycling the Via TransilvanicaRead moreIf I were planning the trip again, I would allow at least a week and I might concede a detour toEfteling theme parknear Tilburg. The Maasroute was uniformly high quality, beautiful and easy to use. The signposting was so impressive at every turn that it was hardly necessary to refer to the map, freeing you up to be completely present on the ride. The route is well served by campsites, hotels and public transport, so it’s straightforward to adapt your adventure along the way to suit your family’s cycling capacity. However, this does require constant planning and puzzle-solving. Set expectations for a fun, challenging adventure rather than a relaxed holiday. And build in lots of ice-cream stops.The writer and family stayed attheGreen Elephanthostelin Maastricht (family room€78). The sauna and morning coffee were included.

You might return to it years later, and even enjoy it – but it should never hit quite the same way as it did that first summer it was everywhere.Unfortunately, this high-season, low-stakes tradition has been tested over the past decade by our heavily saturated yet highly atomised consumer culture. These days, we’re flooded with options (rosorange wine? Smoked beers?) but struggle to align behind any of them. The TikTok-driven trend cycle doesn’t help, claiming every teenager’s cupboard-raiding concoction is the next big thing.So I was taken aback – and a little delighted – when the drink of this summer made itself known to me as though it were the year 2015, not 2025: organically, insistently and right on time. It’s Lonkero: gin mixed with grapefruit soda, available on draught and served in pints.I feel confident in my pick, but I’ve also included some alternatives. The debate, after all, is part of the fun.Lonkero, or Finnish long drinkI first learned of Lonkero on 18 June, when a friend messaged our group chat saying she’d just tried one at the pub, and that it had been “occupying a lot of brain space” since.None of us had ever heard of it. The next day, another friend tried it, was instantly won over and bought a case. Then it came up again at my gym, an entirely different social circle. Then a second pub started serving it.When I finally got around to tryingLonkero, I was immediately converted – and, judging by the pint glasses containing telltale grapefruit wedges on all the tables surrounding me, most of Norwich had been, too.“We’re bizarrely doing very well in Norwich,” confirms the Lonkero co-founder Paige Gibbons. Other UK hotspots include Edinburgh, Brighton and pockets of London; they have also just started distributing to the north.Though Lonkero is a new brand, having launched in May last year, the drink itself dates back to 1952, and the Helsinki Olympic Games. To mark the occasion, the host nation came up with a premixed beverage of gin and grapefruit soda; it proved such a hit, with locals as well as visitors, it stuck.The genericlonkero(“long drink” in English) has since been dubbed the national drink of Finland. The Lonkero co-founder Joe Harris developed a taste for it while working in Helsinki, then teamed up with Gibbons to bring it to the UK.For Gibbons, not a fan of beer or cider, Lonkero held instant appeal as an easy-drinking beverage served in pints. “I always used to joke that I was fed up with paying double the price for a drink that I’d finish sooner,” she says.She was not alone: in its first six months, Lonkero sold more than 50,000 pints. Distribution has been focused on pubs, which can offer Lonkero on tap and present it as an alternative to a session ale or cider (rather than an alcopop or even a G&T). Gibbons describes it as a “new category of drink”.“What we’ve found is that, if people try it, they get it,” she says. “Word of mouth has been phenomenal for us – if you find it and like it, it’s actually something you tell your friends about.”That shareable quality, I’d argue, is the X-factor that distinguishes a bona fide drink of the summer from one drummed up for clicks. Very few of the beverages that go viral on TikTok actually make an impact in pubs and bars (and I would know). Lonkero, on the other hand, has hit Norwich with unmistakable force. At this rate, we might wind up with a pub for every day of the year and a Lonkero pub for every Sunday.Spicy paloma (or spicy margarita)View image in fullscreen‘It combines two already trendy cocktails: the paloma and the spicy margarita.’Photograph: cdwheatley/Getty ImagesOf course, as much as the answer should be obvious, the debate is part of what makes the “drink of the summer” question so compelling.Stylist magazine was early to call it, declaring back in May that the2025 beverageof choice was the spicy paloma. It was a safe pick, combining two already trendy cocktails: the paloma and the spicy margarita.The traditional paloma combines tequila, grapefruit soda and lime juice; in this case, the addition of jalapeños or chilli peppers and often a spicy rim add kick.At the time of Stylist’s report, it was already being offered at many trendy London joints, but has the added advantage of being easy to whip up off-menu.Spritz with a twistView image in fullscreen‘The holiday hasn’t begun until you’ve got a bright orange beverage in a goldfish-bowl glass in your hand.’Photograph: RooM the Agency/AlamyThe Aperol spritzmay have ushered in the concept of the “drink of the summer”; it remains the defining example, along with the less syrupy Campari spritz. Still today, the holiday hasn’t officially begun until you have a bright orange beverage in a goldfish-bowl glass in your hand.In the years since Aperol’s peak, however, there have been rumblings of dissent: it’s too sweet, too obvious, too 2021 …Thissummer’s spritz of choicehas been declared the Hugo (or St-Germain) spritz, comprising elderflower cordial, prosecco, soda water, mint and lime. It signals your discernment amid an orange sea – and, even better, it’s now available in a can from M&S.If elderflower is too subtle for you, the limoncello spritz – another new M&S cocktail – is a similarly sweet and eye-catching alternative to Aperol, like replacing your tired old orange highlighter with a snazzy yellow one.Naked and famousIf you are unwilling to be parted from Aperol, anaked and famousmight be your next favourite order.Delish magazine’s pick for drink of summer 2025, the cocktail packs a heavy punch with equal parts mezcal, yellow chartreuse, Aperol and fresh lime juice.It was devised in 2011 by the New York bartender Joaquín Simó, who described it as a “more evolved, refined margarita”, and has been steadily gaining popularity along with mezcal.If anything thwarts your order, it will be the chartreuse. The French herbal liqueur hasbeen in short supplysince the Carthusian monks who produce it decided to focus instead on “solitude and prayer”.BuzzBallzView image in fullscreen‘The globular pre-mixed cocktail loved by gen Z.’Photograph: Matt Fidler/The GuardianYou may have already learned on this website ofBuzzBallz, the globular pre-mixed cocktails loved by gen Z, available in flavours including Tequila ’Rita, Lotta Colada and Choc Tease.They tick many of the boxes for “drink of the summer”: they’re attention-grabbing on social media, a conversation starter in person (did you know the company is female-owned?), and highly portable: is that a BuzzBallz in your pocket or are you just happy to see me?They are not more offensive than most pre-mixed cocktails – and almost impressively refined, given the high alcohol content – but the taste is rather beside the point. Faced with the novel selection of brightly coloured balls, they feel more like Pokémon than beverages: you want to try ’em all.For the moment, until gen Z moves on, BuzzBallz have the added advantage of making you seem youthful and in the know by association.Suntory –196View image in fullscreen‘For those not sure they have the prerequisite rizz for BuzzBallz.’Photograph: SUNTORYFor those not sure they have the prerequisite rizz for BuzzBallz, Suntory -196 is a more grown-up yet still novel alternative.The vodka-based RTDs are a vending-machine staple in Suntory’s native Japan, butonly launched in the UKlast year; they are now widely available in supermarkets (though, sadly, not vending machines), in grapefruit and lemon flavours.The name (“minus one nine six”) refers to the temperature at which fruit is frozen, using liquid nitrogen, before being crushed into powder and mixed with shochu and vodka. With half the alcohol content of BuzzBallz, they are a safer bet in more ways than one.White Claw and ‘ranch water’View image in fullscreenRanch water is best served on a flamingo.Photograph: Image by Marie LaFauci/Getty ImagesAt the opposite end of the youthful-abandon spectrum is a growing subcategory that might be termed “fitspo bevs”.Where ordering a vodka soda marks you as calorie-conscious, unchill and so 90s, today’s trend for “hard seltzers” is positioned as optimisation, not deprivation.White Claw, my own longtime premix of choice, is best described as fruit-flavoured fizzy water with an ambiguous-sounding “gluten-free malted alcohol base” (not vodka, but some other thing).In April, the makers launched a limited-edition Green Apple flavour, just in time forbrat summerround two.An even more streamlined option is “ranch water”: basically, fizzy water spiked with white tequila and lime. The New York Times recipesuggests spicing it upwith a salt rim, and a splash of Cointreau or flavoured syrup – but even that might be too much fuss for purists.‘Coke and beer – in one glass, please’: my gut-churning search for a signature drinkRead moreMelbourne’s ‘Mont Blanc’ and Bristol’s TiramibruIf the drink of the summer isn’t alcoholic, it tends to skew towards a refreshing dessert. Tiramisu is emerging as the flavour of these summer months, with Starbucks UK winning over gen Z with its limited-edition tiramisu-inspireddrinks menu.The secret to its success has been “cold foam”: an airy, frothy, dairy topping that sits on top of iced coffees (leading Slateto declare the drinkof the summer … foam).In Bristol, Full Court Press cafehas been doing brisktrade in its new Tiramibru: nitrogen-infused cold-brew coffee, topped with a shaken jersey pouring cream, mixed with a hint of panela sugar and a dusting of chocolate powder.Co-owner Jonny Simpson describes it as a twist on the iced-coffee-with-cream drinks that are popular across east Asia and recently went viral in Melbourne as a “Mont Blanc”. “We wanted to run a dessert-like drink that felt like an afternoon treat,” he says. “It tastes like a liquid tiramisu, hence the name.”It has proved extremely popular, even at £5 a pop. “We often struggle to keep up with the cold-brew production on hot days.”The Tiramibru will run to the end of the summer; Simpson is already thinking of how to adapt it for winter.It is, after all, a less crowded market.Explore more on these topicsCocktailsFood & drink industryAlcoholFoodSummer food and drinkfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Like bumping into a teacher outside school or witnessing someone take off their shoes during a flight. It’s legal, sure, but there’s always a moment of deep discomfort and confusion before acceptance. And that’s pretty much how I imagine many people feel about drinking port in summer. Or, indeed, at any time of the day that isn’t evening, or served alongside anything that isn’t an intriguing, veiny cheese.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Consider Porto, the city responsible for bringing the drink to the rest of the world – do you think that, when the temperatures creep up, everyone there stops drinking the stuff? No, they find new ways to enjoy it. Improvise, adapt, overcome.The most popular way to incorporate the joys of port into summertime drinking is to serve it with a mixer. Enter the port tonic (portonic?), a likely combination of the fortified wine of the region and the British presence in its trade. (For a basic portonic, fill a glass with ice, add 50ml port and top with tonic, although you probably guessed that already.) You can make it with pretty much any port, depending on how precious you are about swirling your top-shelf stuff into tonic or soda water. The last time I was in Porto, I was visiting Cockburn’s, and white port and tonic was the soupe du jour – for a typical serving, add a wedge of lemon or lime and a sprig of mint.Looking for something a bit different? I asked a few professionals. “As well as serving it with soda, we also use white port in longer, citrus-led punches,” says Anna Šebelová of Edinburgh’sTimberyard. “We love it in the likes of a 50:50 martini with an aromatic gin, where it replaces vermouth beautifully.”“With dessert, I sometimes serve an upgrade on the average port and tonic,” says Andy Beynon, chef/owner ofBehindin London. “I top it up with verjus, which adds a floral element from the unripened grapes. It’s perfect with summer dishes featuring mango and lime or coconut sorbet.”Anything else? Everything I’ve learned about the existence ofthe Cheeky Vimtococktail has been against my will. It’s a 50ml measure of ruby port topped up with WKD Blue, something I haven’t had the, er, pleasure of trying yet, but if that’s your bag, go for it.Ports, tonics, Cheeky Vimtos: whatever you’re drinking, never mind what you serve it in – a highball, a rocks glass, a wine glass, a pint glass. It’s a mere vessel to allow the transportation of liquid sustenance to your body when the world is on fire, in more ways than one.Four ports to sip while the sun’s outMorrisons Ruby Port£9.50 (75cl), 19%.

Following the ceremony, the double doors were opened wide, so friends and family could line the ramp all the way to the edge of the lagoon. There, standing majestically at the end of a green gondola, was Adriana’s childhood friend Giulia, a champion ofvoga Veneta,or Venetian rowing, ready to take the couple to the other side of the island for lunch.While Giulia rowed Adriana and Thom around the island, the rest of us walked across it toTrattoria Da Romano, where Adriana’s family have celebrated for lifetimes, and it was completely given over to our euphoric wedding party. I am sure I would remember all seven courses (several of which involved more than one dish) even if I didn’t have the menu memento stuck to our fridge with a cat magnet. What I remember most vividly, though, is the fish risotto, because Adriana told me to get near enough the kitchen door to see how energetically the chefs beat it, and how soft and rippling the texture was.It was a perfect example ofrisotto all’onda, which means “risotto with a wave”. It thickens during the passage from pan to plate, becoming dense and creamy and moving slowly in a sort-of ripple on the plate (I was really taken by the way the waiters tapped the plate to even out the rice).Seeing both the beating and the serving made me realise that I still have much to learn when it comes to getting the consistency right. For now, I find it helpful to think of the consistency as being closer to creamy porridge than to rice: loose but not soupy. With this in mind, this week’s recipe is a novice risotto with courgettes, which is also helped by the addition of cream cheese.Serve immediately with very cold white wine. And, for afters, and also inspired by Adriana and Thom, a mixture of lemon sorbet, vodka and prosecco, AKAsgroppino.Risotto with courgettes, goat’s cheese and lemonServes44 medium courgettes1.6 litresvegetable brothOlive oil30g unsalted butter2 shallots, peeled and finely diced400g carnaroli rice100g mild goat’s or cream cheese30g parmesan, gratedFinely grated zest of 1 unwaxed lemonTop and tail the courgettes. Grate two of them on the coarse side of a box grater, and cut the other two into thin slices with a mandoline or sharp knife. Pat the slices with kitchen towel, then rub with olive oil and cook on a griddle pan until tender and marked with lines. Cut the grilled courgettes into thin strips and keep warm.Put the stock in a pan at the back of the stove and bring to a gentle simmer. In a heavy-based wide saucepan, warm two tablespoons of olive oil and 10g of the butter, then gently fry the shallots until soft. Add the grated courgettes and move them around for a minute, then add the rice and stir so it clatters against the sides of the pan for two minutes – it should be glossy and glassy.Add a ladle of broth, stir until it’s absorbed, then repeat, adding broth and stirring over a low-medium heat that keeps the risotto barely simmering, for about 17 minutes, until the rice is plump and the consistency is soft and rippling – like a creamy porridge, but not soupy.Take off the heat, beat in the butter, goat’s cheese or cream cheese and parmesan, then stir or, better still, jolt the pan so the risotto comes up and over in a wave that mixes the ingredients and also loosens starch.Meanwhile, very quickly reheat the strips of courgette in a pan, then add the lemon zest. Divide the risotto between four plates, bash the sides of the plates so the risotto spreads, and top each serving with a little pile of grilled courgette strips.Explore more on these topicsRiceA kitchen in RomeFoodItalian food and drinkMain courseCheeserecipesShareReuse this content"

The free accounts were withdrawn for new customers in 2011.The sole trader Dave Lawrence* opened his business account in 2005 and received a letter confirming that he qualified for the FreeBankingForever tariff and “need never pay banking charges again”.He said: “Which part of for ever do Santander think doesn’t apply now, and how can they justify introducing charges given their pledges to the contrary?”Santander took over the bank previously known as Abbey National in 2004 and, after the acquisitions of the building societies Bradford & Bingley and Alliance & Leicester, it rebranded everything as Santander in 2010.It was forced to U-turn on proposedcharges to its forever accounts in 2012after customers threatened legal action. It claimed that it had been responding to customer demand for upgraded services.Jennifer Iles, a graphic designer, also signed up to the service because of the “free for ever” promise. “I objected when Santander tried to impose monthly charges in 2012,” she said. “Now they are not only trying to renege again but are denying the obligation. They will have a fight on their hands.”View image in fullscreenAbbey National business banking advert.Photograph: Abbey customerSantander told the Guardian that accounts that predated the 2008 merger of Abbey and Alliance & Leicester were migrated into its Business Every Day account in 2015 and that the terms and conditions of that contract did not include the free for ever promise.A spokesperson said:“The business banking landscape has changed significantly over the last decade.

Current staff will have to work harder, Thorley adds, and the extra pressure could affect customer service levels and opening times.Philip Thorley said changes made in last year’s budget had stopped him hiring new people this summer.“This affects anybody in retail, in the high street and other entry-level jobs, especially young people,” he says.After the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, announced the NICs rise in October, business groupsargued that they would hit hiring and retention. On Thursday signs of that impact emerged: the latest official jobs data showed that unemployment climbed and wage growth slowed in the three months to May.The trade body for the hospitality sector said data showed it had been the hardest-hit sector since the budget, accounting for 45% of all job losses. The chair of UKHospitality, Kate Nicholls, said: “The change to employer NICs in particular, was socially regressive and had a disproportionate impact on entry level jobs.”Cliff Nicholls, who runs two trampoline parks in Tamworth and Bolton, says his business rates are 240% over what they paid last year, resulting in him cutting about 14 jobs.Due to high business rates increasing energy costs, Cliff has reduced opening hours, which is what he says is affecting his business the most.Jump Xtreme was open seven days a week all year round, but it has now had to close two days a week during term-time to save on bills.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In Los Angeles, restaurants and food trucks have been forced to close as the immigrants who cook and wait tables fear Ice and other law enforcement.“Farm workers in many states are thinking about leaving the country because they are facing more obstacles to work under this anti-immigrant administration,” said Elizabeth Rodriguez, director of farm worker advocacy with National Farm Worker Ministry, a longstanding organization in south Texas.“They are scared, there are fewer opportunities, and they are no longer prospering here. Their fear will soon be seen in the harvest, when the quantities of produce are depleted.”graphs show that immigrants make up 27% of agricultural workers nationwide. In some states it’s even higher: in California, foreign-born workers are nearly two-thirds of the agricultural workforce. And in Florida, they make up more than half of crop production workers.From farm to table, at least one in five jobs in the food industry is carried out by immigrants, the equivalent of 14 million workers across the sector. This includes 27% of agricultural workers nationwide and 33% of meatpackers.In restaurants, 46%of chefs and 31% of cooks were born outside the US – mostly in Mexico, China, Guatemala and El Salvador.These jobs are critical: immigrants made up a disproportionate number of“essential”workers during the Covid-19 pandemic, and many were exposed to unsafe conditions so that crops could be harvested, cows milked and takeout delivered.“Whether it’s the workers behind the scenes in meatpacking plants or on the frontlines of the grocery store, our country relies heavily on the labor of immigrants to keep our food system running and our families fed,” said Mark Lauritsen, international vice-president at UnitedFoodand Commercial Workers International Union.“Without a stable, skilled workforce, safety and quality can decline, shelves can sit empty and grocery prices could rise even more.”graphs show immigrants comprise 33% of meat processing workers. In Nebraska, they make up 58% of those workers. More than one-fifth of all truck transportation workers are immigrants. There are 462,000 migrants working in grocery stores, or 15% of the workforce. They also make up more than one-third of the workforce in commercial bakeries.Yet food industry jobs, from fields to slaughterhouses and supermarkets to delivery drivers, are notoriously difficult and often low-paid: sometimes as little as $7.25 per hour, the federal minimum wage. Farmhands are often paid only a few dollars per box of tomatoes or cabbages harvested - backbreaking work with no shade.American food companies rely on undocumentedpeople for almost halfof the most physical jobs, including the farm laborers who cultivate crops, tend livestock and build fences, as well as the meat processors who slaughter, eviscerate and package at high speeds.Most Americans understand this. In the run-up to last year’s election, 75% of registered voterstold Pew Researchthat they believed undocumented immigrants mostly fill jobs US citizens don’t want to do.And now, with Ice raids and mass deportations, these jobs have become even more dangerous. At least one farm worker,Jaime Alanís, a 57-year-old Mexican man, hasdied after falling from a greenhouse trying to escape armed Ice agentsduring a raid in southern California last week. In response to these terrifying Ice raids which are spreading and becoming more violent, some farm workers in California are planning a strike in coming weeks and will be calling on consumers to boycott produce.“It is appalling to see the threat of violence and deportation that immigrant workers face every day. These people play a crucial role in restaurants, and more importantly in the community,” said Elyanna Calle, a restaurant worker in Austin, Texas, and president of Restaurant Workers United.“A raid, a deportation means the destruction of a life someone has fought to build; it means the destruction of families and vibrant communities. I have seen my co-workers fear for their safety, I have seen them go into fight or flight mode at the prospect of an Ice raid – this is not something that any person, any immigrant deserves.”Graphs show that according to the National Restaurant Association, 4m immigrants work in the industry, including 31% of cooks, 18% of waitstaff and more than 17% of food preparation and counter workers.If the Trump administration oversees even a fraction of its promised mass deportation of 11 million undocumented immigrants, it could lead to major disruptions across the food system: crops left to spoil in the fields, supermarket shelves unstocked, takeout deliveries delayed and food prices soaring even higher. It could also upend rural economies that depend on migrant workers and their families who live, work and go to school in small declining communities.“All of this will have a huge impact on the rest of us because the immigrant community contributes much more than their labor; they pay taxes,” said Rodriguez. “They invest in the economy, and if they make less money, we all make less, and when corporations make less, they increase prices so we lose again.”Data for this piece, unless otherwise noted, come from the Migration Policy InstituteExplore more on these topicsUS immigrationOur unequal earthFarmingFood & drink industryAgricultureRestaurantsFoodfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Meawhile,Martin Cooperwonders why his garden wants to become a forestThu 17 Jul 2025 13.02 EDTLast modified on Thu 17 Jul 2025 13.04 EDTShareYour article paints a bleak picture of the challenges facing reforestation in the UK (In some UK woodlands, every young tree has died. What’s going wrong? 10 July). The failure of natural regeneration – driven by drought, heat, disease and deer grazing – is not just a crisis for ancient woodlands, it’s a stark warning for the future of all UK forestry.This ecological breakdown reveals a fundamental flaw in our current approach: we are too focused on the number of saplings in the ground and not enough on their long-term resilience. Whether through natural regeneration or new planting schemes, tree survival must be the priority. With mortality rates increasing by 90%, as the article highlights, it’s clear that traditional methods are no longer fit for purpose in a changing climate.To build forests that can withstand future conditions, we must invest in resilience from the outset. Research into techniques that improve sapling survivability is essential to protecting ancient woodlands and establishing new ones. Innovative approaches – such as vertical farming to produce climate-adapted saplings and biochar-enhanced substrates to improve soil health – are already showing promise. These methods can yield stronger, faster-growing trees with significantly higher survival rates.Our ancient woodlands are among the UK’s most treasured natural assets. If we are to protect and restore them – while ensuring they continue to absorb carbon and support biodiversity – we need a new approach to UK forestry, one with resilience and survivability at its core.Alastair CollierChief research and development officer, A Healthier EarthI was really interested to read that saplings weren’t thriving in ancient forests. It is quite the opposite in my garden. I’m not much of a gardener, but every time I am moved to tidy up, most of my efforts go into pulling up, if I can, and cutting back if I can’t, little ash, sycamore, oak, yew, lime, holly and even the occasional chestnut tree. This is both from flowerpots and flowerbeds. When I cut them back they seem to grow back even stronger. What is happening that a south London garden seems desperate to become a forest and ancient forests are giving up?Martin CooperBromley, LondonExplore more on these topicsTrees and forestsClimate crisisSoilBiocharGardenslettersShareReuse this content"

Plus letters fromProf Anthony Seaton,Martin EmpsonandDr Nicholas RoseThu 17 Jul 2025 13.04 EDTLast modified on Thu 17 Jul 2025 13.12 EDTShareI agree with Wes Streeting that the forthcoming five-day strike by resident doctors in England is “completely unreasonable” (Resident doctors accused of ‘greedy’ pay demands before Streeting talks, 17 July). It is less than a year since their last pay dispute was settled, following a bitter war that lasted 18 months. Patient care suffered again and again.Tactically propagated via targeted social media, this conflict will rapidly spread across borders to the devolved nations. Therefore we in Wales must also anticipate a cruel and chaotic disruption toNHScare by the autumn.Any public sympathy that the doctors had has gone, and if the British Medical Association is going to succeed in this dispute, they must change their demands and surely offer something in return. Rather than arguing for “pay restoration”, they should emphasise the debt that a graduate owes after five or six years as an unpaid medical student and the compulsory overtime they work at night and at weekends.Perhaps if graduates agreed to work full-time in the NHS for five years, that massive student debt could be waived. In parallel, rather than arguing to further raise their base salaries with headline percentages that could never be offered by any government to any public sector worker, they should ask for their overtime to be paid at double their standard rate of pay. The public might support this because it is logical and fair.Medicine is a wonderful career. Over our lifetime, it is secure and well rewarded. We have the privilege and responsibility to be present and influential at important moments in people’s lives. Money cannot buy that opportunity. I urge the BMA and resident doctors to construct a better argument and avoid another bitter pay war so soon after peace was negotiated. The BMA should remember that the police and army cannot strike.Dr Ieuan DaviesConsultant paediatrician, Llantood, Sir BenfroMany consultants and those of us now retired to the status of informed NHS patients would have been astonished to read that some junior doctors consider that they are as valuable to the NHS as their predecessors of 10 or 20 years ago. On the contrary, they are in general much less so. Moreover, they are not fully trained, as some claim, until they have acquired the necessary skills and knowledge to become consultants.As for being professional, this is difficult to equate with the willingness to withdraw care from their patients. The NHS would lose little if those one sees representing them in the media were to find themselves employment other than in a caring profession.Many young people with a real vocation to medicine rather than a selfish desire to earn more than their academic peers would have been delighted to have taken their places in medical schools.Prof Anthony SeatonEdinburghYesterday morning I had an unexpected visit to a local NHS hospital. As I get older, I spend an increasing amount of time at clinics, hospitals and my GP’s surgery. As always, I was struck by the kindness, patience and professionalism of every member of staff. While clearly dealing with shortages of beds, resources and staff, they always remain robust and cheerful. All NHS staff are working harder for less money in real terms.Wes Streeting’s attacks on resident doctors for “unreasonable” demands is a classic divide-and-rule tactic. He would rather NHS staff, whether they are cleaners, admin workers or nurses, blame resident doctors for their low pay rather than a succession of governments that have turned their backs on health workers’ justified pay claims.Instead of being their enemy, other NHS workers should see the strike as an inspiration and give it their full support. That’s why I will be visiting the doctors’ picket line next week to show my solidarity.Martin EmpsonManchesterResident doctors are going on strike allegedly for catchup pay. However, talk to the resident doctors who have voted to strike and the frustration and crisis of morale is less about pay and more about unsafe working conditions, an undermining of their role by the chaotic introduction of less qualified staff such as physician associates and uncertain career prospects because there are not enough specialist training places to prepare them for senior jobs.Unless these deep structural problems are fixed, no pay rise will solve the problem.Dr Nicholas RoseGreen Templeton College, OxfordExplore more on these topicsNHSDoctorsIndustrial actionWes StreetingHealthHospitalslettersShareReuse this content"

But they will also tell you how mortified they were, how they apologised or retreated in shame, and then worked extra hard at finding ways to avoid making the same mistake in future.What they never do is gaslight the person making the complaint, or try to shift the blame anywhere but themselves; that is the trait of a narcissist. Autistic people can be narcissists and narcissistic people can also be autistic – there’s no causal link, so let’s please leave autism out of this discussion, as it’s entirely irrelevant. Narcissists are naturally drawn to careers that put them in the limelight, and so it’s hardly surprising that they’re overrepresented in the media, entertainment and politics.Gregg Wallace must take responsibility for his own actions, but it is equally the responsibility of employers in those “limelight industries” to spot narcissistic behaviour in the workplace and control it appropriately.Richard CrossLondonHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

But that figure has nearly halved to 48%, the lowest in the world, according to theWorld Health Organization.Globally, more than14 million infants remain unvaccinatedand the world is not on track to meet goals ofhalving the number of these “zero-dose” childrencompared with 2019 levels by 2030, the WHO reported on Tuesday.While misinformation and vaccine hesitancy have driven falls in immunisation in some countries, “that has not been the problem here”, said Dr Tedbabe Degefie Hailegebriel, chief of health for UnicefSudan. “This plummeting coverage is driven entirely by the war.”Thecountry’s civil warbegan two years ago and has killed tens of thousands of people and displaced millions more, in what the International Rescue Committee has called “the biggest humanitarian crisis ever recorded”.There were 838,000 children in Sudan last year who did not receive a single dose of vaccine – the third-highest figure in the world, behind only Nigeria (2.1 million) and India (909,000).View image in fullscreenInternally displaced children in a camp in South Kordofan state.Photograph: Thomas Mukoya/ReutersThe proportion of children who have received a DTP-1 jab – the first dose of the diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (whooping cough) vaccine – is seen as a key indicator of access to essential healthcare. Missing it, Hailegebriel said, meant a “child, and most probably also their parents, have almost zero contact with the health system”.She said the war had hit Sudan’s health service hard, with people displaced and the physical destruction of health facilities, supply lines and information systems “that makes the health service functional”.“Health workers – doctors, nurses, midwives, community volunteers – have not been paid in months. And just the basic infrastructure – the clean water available to health facilities, the electricity availability to health facilities – is totally destroyed,” she said.Disease outbreaks in Sudan tend to affect people who have “lost your safe place, your home, your protection, however modest that might be”, and find themselves in camps or temporary accommodation.“When that is coupled with an already vulnerable child who is not vaccinated, the vulnerability is compounded,” she said.Diseases that can be prevented with vaccination,including measles, not only kill but can leave survivors with long-term complications, Hailegebriel said, adding that these were “children who are robbed of their future”.View image in fullscreenA measles jab is given by a Médecins Sans Frontières nurse in Jebel Marra. MSF says there have been outbreaks of measles across four Darfur states.Photograph: Thibault Fendler/MSFThe WHO said war and conflicts around the world were a major threat to immunisation progress, with children living in one of 26 countries “affected by fragility, conflict or humanitarian emergencies” being three times more likely to be unvaccinated than their counterparts in stable countries.However, there were “emerging signs of slippage” or stalling progress in many parts of the world, said Dr Kate O’Brien, director of the WHO’s immunisation, vaccines and biologicals department.“Even the smallest drops in immunisation coverage as measured at the country level can have devastating consequences. It opens the door to deadly disease outbreaks and puts even more pressure on health systems that are already stretched,” she said.And while access to vaccination remains the main issue worldwide, “we’re extremely concerned about mis- and disinformation because of the threat it has to worsen the situation”.View image in fullscreenA vaccination centre in Kassala state in July.Photograph: Mohammed Abdulmajid/UnicefO’Brien said she expected cuts to aid funding to affect vaccine coverage in future years, with countries struggling to raise domestic finance.Humanitarian efforts had succeeded in boosting vaccination rates in the first half of this year in Sudan, said Hailegebriel, but Unicef’s appeal for the country remained unfunded.The charity has shipped in containers to rebuild the country’s “cold chain”, vital for keeping vaccines and other essential medicines at the right temperature so they remain effective on the journey from factory to patient. But when conflict flares those efforts have to stop.Wars and conflict causing huge drop in global vaccinations, UN warnsRead more“In areas where there was active fighting, active conflict, of course we will not be able to deliver,” she said. “But when the situation changes, that’s when we move in.“The destruction is unspeakable. The whole infrastructure gets damaged, medicines get looted. So whenever you go into those new areas, it is again rebuilding to make sure the already shaking health system doesn’t collapse further.“The situation of Sudan has not received the world’s attention it deserves,” she said. “It is our hope that this will change, and these hostilities stop so that children get the peaceful environment they need to live and thrive.”Abdallah Idriss Abugarda, who leads the Darfur Diaspora Association in the UK, said the situation in the Darfur region was becoming more difficult, particularly in thebesieged city of El Fasher.That meant, Abugarda said, that most families he spoke to in Sudan had more pressing concerns than vaccination. “It’s not a priority to them – they want to have food delivered, and medicine for malaria and fever for the children.”Explore more on these topicsGlobal developmentGlobal healthSudanVaccines and immunisationAfricaMiddle East and north AfricaMMRnewsShareReuse this content"

Its shooting on Tuesday has advocates calling for the British Columbia government to act faster when it comes to working with First Nations on environmental stewardship.Provincial officials have long insisted Tex posed a danger to residents. Although there was no order to kill the animal, they said it had already “stalked” two people on the mainland before swimming to Texada, and had been moved once before. If the bear threatened public safety, they declared, conservation officers would need to respond.Grizzly with checkered past swims miles to Canadian island – and into hot waterRead moreLocal First Nations communities offered weeks ago to rehome the bear to their territories. But some of the island’s 1,200 residents felt Tex should be euthanized instead, said Katrin Glenn, a longtime Texada resident and the creator of the “Save Tex” Facebook group.“I’ve always said, Texada Island is not safe for him. And it’s not because of the land, it’s not because of anything but the people here,” she said.“We knew there were people driving around with guns.”The province’s conservation officer service said on Tuesday it was investigating the death on the island of a grizzly bear, which they confirmed had been shot.Bear behaviour specialists saidTex was simply a young male bear gaining independence by exploring. Glenn said she saw Tex at the end of May around her farm perimeter. “He had followed my fence line very respectfully,” she said. “He was a very gentle bear.”In June, several First Nations communities offered a strategy to relocate the bear, and a coordinated effort between the shíshálh, Tla’amin and Homalco First Nations to relocate the bear to Homalco territory was under way when Tex was killed.“We are deeply saddened by this outcome. Tex’s life mattered, and our Nations had come together in a good way to find a peaceful solution,” said Tla’amin Nation in a statement.Wayne McCrory, a biologist, wrote to the province last monthhighlighting his supportfor a proposal by the Mamalilikulla First Nation to move Tex. The nation’s chief, John Powell, said on Wednesday he was devastated the bear was killed and angry the government was slow to listen to Indigenous communities. TheCBC reportedat the end of June that the three First Nations were still waiting for government officials to back their removal plan.“I knew the writing was on the wall when there was resistance with the government,” Powell said, adding that “it really has to examine its approach to this situation, because this is not the last time this will happen.”Randene Neill, the province’s minister of water, land and resource stewardship, said on Tuesday that authorities had been working in partnership with the First Nations to move Tex.“The timing [of the bear’s death] is especially unfortunate,” Neill said.But Nicholas Scapillati, head of the Grizzly Bear Foundation, said the tragedy of Tex’s death contained an important lesson for the province. “I hope his death wasn’t in vain and we do have a mechanism in place to take what can be actually learned from a situation like this,” he said.Powell noted that British Columbia passed legislation in 2019 to align with the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, and said the Tex incident showed the government still had a long way to go when it comes to consulting with First Nations.“I hope they examine this result objectively,” he said. “Their inaction was responsible for killing this bear.”Explore more on these topicsCanadaAnimalsWildlifeAmericasIndigenous peoplesnewsShareReuse this content"

Previously, this fast-track process was limited to low-risk activities.According to Araújo, this will affect about 90% of licensing procedures in Brazil, including those for mining companies and the vast majority of agricultural activities.“We’re seeing the implosion of Brazil’s environmental licensing system, that is going to become full self-licensing, where a company just clicks a button and the permit gets printed,” said Araújo, who served as president of Brazil’s environmental protection agency, Ibama, from 2016 to 2018.The law also states that agencies responsible for protecting the rights of Indigenous and quilombola communities will only have a say in licensing processes for projects located on officially recognised territories –excluding more than 30% of Indigenous lands and over 80% of quilombola areasthat have been awaiting official titling for years.“Many of these lands are already under dispute or being targeted by exploitative companies,” said Dinamam Tuxá, executive coordinator of the Articulation of Indigenous Peoples of Brazil (Apib), who described the law’s approval as “the legalisation of a process of extermination of Indigenous peoples”.Tuxá says Lula should veto the bill, but recognises that in a predominantly opposition-led congress, the president’s decision is likely to be overturned. “That’s why civil society must remain organised to pressure lawmakers not to overturn the veto,” he said.If the law does come into force, it is likely to trigger a wave of legal challenges, as activists and legal experts argue thatit violates the constitutionand previous rulings by the supreme court.Some activists have criticised Lula’s administration for not doing enough to prevent the bill’s approval, and even for giving it a free pass, asreported by the news outlet Sumaúma. Resistance to the bill was primarily confined to the environment minister, Marina Silva, who described it as “the burial of environmental licensing”.According to the Climate Observatory’s Araújo, the law also creates a major embarrassment for both Brazil and Lula just months before the country isto host Cop30 in the Amazon in November. “This law is a serious setback and will shape how Brazil is viewed by those who see it as a potential environmental leader,” she said.Explore more on these topicsBrazilAmericasIndigenous peoplesLuiz Inácio Lula da SilvaClimate crisisnewsShareReuse this content"

In December a ship carrying Russian oilwas seizedafter it severed cables between Finland and Estonia.Incidents around Taiwan over the past 18 months include aChinese-crewed freighter cutting cablesbetween the island and its outlying Penghu Islands in February by repeatedly manoeuvring in a zigzag pattern over the cables. The previous month, a Chinese-owned cargo ship was cited as the likely cause ofdamage to a Taiwan-US cable.The report said: “While it is difficult to definitively attribute recent incidents in the Baltic Sea and around Taiwan to state-sponsored sabotage, such operations align with both Russia and China’s strategic objectives, recently observed activities, and current deep-sea capabilities.”Recorded Future said a successful attack on multiple cables – which would cause prolonged disruption – would have to occur in deeper waters and would “very likely involve state-sponsored threat actors, due to the difficulty of accessing these sites”. Such an operation would probably take place before outright conflict, the report said.Recorded Future identified 44 cable damages over the past 18 months, a quarter caused by “anchor dragging” and nearly a third by “unknown causes”, with seismic activity or natural phenomena causing 16% of the incidents.View image in fullscreenAn undersea cable being laid in the Baltic Sea. Analysts say targeting these cables can be an attractive tactic because the damage can be passed off as an accident.Photograph: Lehtikuva/ReutersAnalysts added that damaging subsea cables could be an attractive tactic because it allowed states to target adversaries’ infrastructure via an unsophisticated method that could be passed off as an accident or be carried out by vessels without direct links to the attacks’ suspected sponsor.Recorded Future said improved monitoring of cables and security measures around subsea infrastructure, as well as comprehensive stress tests, would help prevent an incident damaging multiple cables and causing “prolonged connectivity issues”.Despite the high-profile Baltic and Taiwan incidents, the three most disruptive incidents were elsewhere: in the Red Sea in February last year when a Houthi missile caused a ship’s anchor to hit cables – leading to “significant impact on communication networks in the Middle East”; in west Africa a month later due to an underwater rock slide; and off the coast of South Africa in May 2024 due to a cable-dragging incident.Recorded Future said the impact of the Red Sea and Africa incidents showed that the most prolonged disruption happened in areas with limited availability of alternative cables and a shortage of repair expertise regardless of the cause of the disruption.Conversely, two attacks in the Baltic Sea in November last year had minimal impact due to spare capacity and Europe’s resilient internet infrastructure. However, the report said three EU island member states – Malta, Cyprus and Ireland – were more vulnerable due to their reliance on submarine cables for international communications.The UK government’s recent strategic defence review acknowledged the potential threat to the country’s subsea cabling and recommended that the Royal Navy takes a “new leading and coordinating role in securing undersea pipelines, cables, and maritime traffic carrying the information, energy, and goods upon which national life depends”.Explore more on these topicsTelecomsRussiaChinaAsia PacificEuropeInternetTaiwannewsShareReuse this content"

There are staff to guide you, so you don’t have to worry about safety issues!”While some influencers have jumped at the chance to post eye-catching photographs on social media, the reaction of Chinese people online has been mostly negative. “They’re putting profit above consumer safety – it’s way too dangerous,” wrote one Weibo user.Chinese media reported that the Shanxi forestry and grasslands bureau was investigating the matter, adding that this kind of human-animal contact was prohibited.Peter Li, a China policy expert for Humane World forAnimals, told Reuters: “Exploiting wild animals for selfies and marketing gimmicks is not only appallingly bad animal welfare, it’s also potentially risky for customers.”It is not the first exotic animal welfare scandal in China. Last month, tourists visiting a zoo in Liaoning, in the north-east, were condemned for reaching through a metal grate topull tufts of hair off a tiger.A hotel in Chongqing, a city in south-west China, recently attracted scorn for offering a “wake-up service”delivered by red pandas, which could climb into guests’ beds.Contact between humans and exotic animals has also been highlighted by experts as a potential risk for the spread of zoonotic diseases, such as Covid-19.Staff at Wanhui repeatedly hung up the phone when called by the Guardian.According to Reuters, the restaurant said the lion cubs were well cared for by specialist staff.Additional research by Lillian YangExplore more on these topicsChinaAnimal welfareAsia PacificWildlifeAnimalsRestaurantsFoodnewsShareReuse this content"

The league also proposed a minimum $20,000 annual fee for all bookmakers, including small operators who focus on racing.Leaked documents seenby Guardian Australiarevealed the cash grab was justified as a way to address what AFL executives termed an “unprecedented” increase in “integrity risks” posed by the wagering industry, which has exploded in popularity in recent years.AFL admits it has lost control of online gambling oversight amid spike in ‘integrity risks’Read moreThe documents outlined concerns the AFL’s integrity system was seriously deficient and struggled to identify whether players, coaches and staff were using inside information to manipulate betting markets, in breach of their contracts.Bookmakers opposed to the increase were told they needed accept it before the season began, or be banned from taking bets on the sport. By law, all bookmakers must have an agreement with a sport’s governing body.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailWhen the increase was first proposed, several gambling companies described it as “unsustainable” and said it could cripple smaller operators willing to pay their “fair share” to support integrity measures.Some bookmakers have told Guardian Australia they increased financial inducements –such as bonus bets or bet-matching – to encourage people to spend more money, despite knowing this could increase harm. In June 2023, a parliamentary inquiry into online gamblingcalled for financial inducements to be banned.The VictorianGamblingand Casino Control Commission (VGCCC) has confirmed it is assessing an application to intervene in the dispute and make a determination about the AFL’s conduct and the reasonableness of its fees. The application was made by an unnamed bookmaker.Before making a decision to intervene, the regulator must assess whether both parties have engaged in genuine negotiations. It must also assess whether a resolution is possible without the regulator’s involvement. It has been assessing the application for more than two months.The regulator has the power to ask for information from the AFL, recover costs for any investigation, and make compulsory determinations to settle the dispute.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s time for Labor to show some courage | Zoe DanielRead more“Previous applications received by the VGCCC did not meet the criteria for a determination as outlined in legislation,” a spokesperson for the regulator said.Two sources at established bookmakers who were not authorised to comment publicly said a determination could set a limit on how much money the AFL could make from gambling. They said a determination could also impact future negotiations.Lachlan Gepp, an expert gambling and sports rights lawyer at Addisons, which has represented bookmakers, said product fees had become “uncommercial and unreasonable” in recent years. The fees were introduced in the early 2000s.“It should be remembered that the laws requiring betting integrity agreements were introduced in Victorian and New South Wales betting legislation to coincide with the blow-up of corporate online bookmaking and to provide funds to the AFL to administer an integrity concern that otherwise did not exist,” Gepp said.“Make no mistake: in 2025, product fees have been morphed into a tax strategy designed to play catchup to the NRL and positioned by AFL spin doctors to solve an invisible growth in betting integrity issues.”The AFL has argued the integrity challenges are real and serious. Its correspondence outlining the increase to bookmakers did not mention commercial objectives.“If the VGCCC determines that the product fee rate sought by the AFL is unreasonable or an overreach in terms of what the law is designed to do, then that outcome has been a long time coming for the online wagering industry,” Gepp said.The AFL declined to comment.One relatively small bookmaker, who declined to be named because of the commercial sensitivity of the issue, and so that they could speak freely, said they had increased inducements in response to the AFL’s proposal.“We will need to introduce additional incentives, not because we want to, but because the market demands it. Without them, we may not be able to keep the business running,” the bookmaker said.In Australia,Gambling Help Onlineis available on 1800 858 858.

The agreement, signed at the V&A Museum and followed by a meeting at Downing Street, sets out plans for closer cooperation on migration, defence, trade and education, including a framework for school exchanges.Merz said the treaty was overdue. “We had you in the European Union and we thought that was enough … but we are now learning that it’s not enough, so we have to do more,” he said.The proposed trilateral alignment was driven by Berlin, but Starmer signalled clear support for closer cooperation with Germany andFrance, describing the UK’s relationship with Merz’s government as a “statement of our ambition to work ever more closely together”.Merz reiterated his regret about Brexit – “I personally deplore this deeply,” he said – but his call for three-way cooperation revives elements of the “core Europe” vision first proposed by his mentor, Wolfgang Schäuble, in the 1990s. He envisaged a tightly integrated group of European powers leading the continent, though at the time Britain was not included.In the post-Brexit world, Merz and Starmer are positioning the UK as too important to exclude, even without rejoining the EU.As Europe faces renewed threats from Russia and uncertainty over Washington’s future role in Nato, both leaders stressed the need for stronger continental coordination.Merz said the returns agreement signed by the UK and France last week should be expanded into a three-way pact with Germany to mount a more coordinated response to irregular migration. “The cooperation between the United Kingdom and France … has to be complemented by an agreement that we aim to achieve between the three of us: UK, Germany, France,” he said via a translator.“We want to drastically reduce illegal migration in Europe. We are on a good path, but we haven’t reached the target yet.”Starmer confirmed that Germany would amend domestic law to allow authorities to seize boat engines and smuggling components destined for Channel crossings, closing a longstanding enforcement gap.“We’ve discussed this at great length … [The chancellor] is now going to change the law so that we can intervene,” the prime minister said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We grieve the lives lost and call on all parties to respect the sacredness of life and the spaces that protect it.”Ibrahim Saqallah, a paramedic at the nearby al-Ahli Arab hospital, told the Guardian that about 10 people were wounded, some critically. The injuries were caused by shrapnel from an exploding artillery shell.Saqallah said the hospital was notified that the church had been hit. “I got into the ambulance and headed straight to the church,” he added. “This [Israeli] army is arrogant – it does not distinguish between Christian or Muslim, nor does it care whether it’s a church, a mosque, a home, or even a school. We are living in the midst of a brutal war.”The shelling of the church also damaged its compound, where hundreds of Palestinians, including children and people with disabilities, have been sheltering during the 21-month war. Israel issued a rare apology and said it was investigating.Attallah Terzi, a displaced 75-year-old Christian now sheltering in a school next to the church, said: “I had just returned to the classroom after being outside for a few minutes when a massive explosion occurred. It was the first time since the beginning of the war that the sound of an explosion was so intense.”Before his death in April, the former pope would call Gabriel Romanelli, an Argentinian, every evening. He began the routine on 9 October 2023, two days after the attacks on Israel by Hamas ignited the devastating war inGaza.Reuters footage from the hospital showed Romanelli to be lightly injured, with a bandaged left leg but able to walk.Terzi witnessed the killing of a woman who had been assisting a man in a wheelchair and another whose head was hit by a stone that appeared to have fallen from the church. She also saw a young man being struck by shrapnel. Romanelli had run to help him before being injured himself.Pope Leo XIV said in a telegram sent by the Vatican’s secretary of state in his name that he was “deeply saddened to learn of the loss of life and injury caused by the military attack” and that he was renewing his calls for an immediate ceasefire.In a statement, the Italian prime minister,Giorgia Meloni, said: “The Israeli raids on Gaza have also hit the Holy Family church. The attacks against the civilian population that Israel has been carrying out for months are unacceptable. No military action can justify such behaviour.”View image in fullscreenChristian Palestinians mourn Saad Salameh and Fumayya Ayyad during their funeral ceremony at the Church of Saint Porphyrius in Gaza City.Photograph: Omar Al-Qattaa/AFP/Getty ImagesElizabeth Funnell, the Middle East representative for the Catholic aid agency Cafod, said: “We once again call on the international community to act urgently to protect civilians, places of worship and humanitarian spaces, and to ensure that people in Gaza have access to the most basic right: the chance to survive.”The Israel Defense Forces said they were aware of the reports.“The circumstances of the incident are under review. The IDF makes every feasible effort to mitigate harm to civilians and civilian structures, including religious sites, and regrets any damage caused to them,” its statement added.The Holy Family church in Gaza spoke in a separate statement of “a number of injured, some in critical condition”.Dozens of Palestinians were killed and wounded during Israeli airstrikes on several areas of the Gaza Strip on Thursday, including four who were killed in an attack on a home close to the Imam al-Shafi’i school in the Zeitoun area of Gaza City.After Francis’s death, Romanelli, who has served as the parish priest since 2019,told the Guardian: “Even after he was hospitalised, he continued calling to check on us. Our grief is deep because we lost someone we felt had become a member of our church.”Francis was a strong advocate of ending the war. In his last public address on Easter Sunday, he condemned the “deplorable humanitarian situation” in Gaza and implored Israel and Hamas to “call for a ceasefire, release the hostages and come to the aid of a starving people, that aspires to a future of peace”.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warGazaPalestinian territoriesIsraelCatholicismChristianityGiorgia MeloninewsShareReuse this content"

A direct rail link would support the creation of jobs and strengthen the vital trade links that underpin our economic relationship with Germany. British businesses will have better access to European markets, whilst German companies will find it easier to invest and operate in the UK.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Other potential rival operators, including Virgin, arehoping to start cross-Channel services.Opening new routes has been difficult due to commercial viability, different track and train systems, and border requirements and station capacity. Eurostar’s longest direct route to date, London to Amsterdam, has had to overcome numerous difficulties, largely linked to border security and passport control, since its delayed inception in 2018.The demand for direct London-Berlin trains is unclear. Passengers can travel between the UK and German capitals in about 10 hours, changing in Brussels and Cologne.Explore more on these topicsRail industryRail transport (UK news)GermanyRail transport (World news)EuropeTransportBrexitnewsShareReuse this content"

One of the three spiritual leaders of the Syrian Druze, Sheikh Hikmat al-Hijri, put out a statement vowing to “respect the peaceful Bedouin clans”.Calls for revenge had begun to circle on social media on Thursday.Syrian security forces initially intervened in Sweida on Monday after a local dispute between Arab Bedouin tribes and Druze fighters escalated into fighting. Druze militias tried to prevent the entry of the Syrian army and attacked them, which led to days of clashes with government forces.TheIsraeli military also intervened, strikingthe Syrian defence ministryheadquarters in Damascus and dozens of Syrian military targets in the south. An Israeli military spokesperson said the strikes were a message to Syria’s president regarding the events in Sweida.At least 516 civilians and fighters were killed in the clashes, according to the UK-based monitor the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. The monitor said at least 86 civilians were killed by government forces and their allies, and that three Bedouin civilians were killed by Druze fighters on Thursday.1:10Israel launches strikes on Damascus as sectarian violence flares in southern Syria – videoSharaa condemned Israel for “wide-scale targeting of civilian and government facilities”. He said the strikes were pushing “matters to a large-scale escalation, except for the effective intervention of American, Arab and Turkish mediation, which saved the region from an unknown fate”.The clashes were the most serious challenge to Damascus’s rule sincea series of massacresin the coastal north-west in March, in which 1,500 mostly Alawite civilians were killed after a foiled attack by remnants of the ousted Assad regime on security forces.The Druze, a religious minority in Syria and the wider Middle East, make up the majority of the population of Sweida province. They have been negotiating with the Islamist-led authorities in Damascus since the fall of Bashar al-Assad in an attempt to achieve autonomy but have yet to reach an agreement that defines their relationship with the new Syrian state.Regional map of Syria, Lebanon and IsraelSome Druze said they felt further estranged from the new authority after the clashes. “I would rather die than be ruled by them. At least I would die with dignity,” said a 25-year-old civil engineer in Sweida, whose two cousins were killed on Tuesday.Other Druze dignitaries, particularly Youssef Jarboua, another of Syria’s three Druze spiritual leaders, have advocated for a more conciliatory approach with Damascus.Sharaa acknowledged abuses against civilians had occurred and said “lawless groups” had committed crimes against them.“We are determined to hold accountable anyone who wronged or harmed our Druze brethren. They are under the protection and responsibility of the state and the law and justice guarantee the rights of all without exception,” he added.View image in fullscreenA woman films ​Syrian demonstrators as they denounce Israeli airstrikes in Damascus.Photograph: Mohammed al-Rifai/EPAThe US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, welcomed the initial ceasefire. Hesaid on Xthat an agreement had been reached to restore calm in the area, urging “all parties to deliver on the commitments they have made”, without elaborating on the nature of the agreement.The US had been mediating in an attempt to stop Israeli strikes on Syria, which came as a surprise as Israeli-Syria ties had been warming since May.Rubio blamed “historic longtime rivalries” for the clashes in Sweida. “It led to an unfortunate situation and a misunderstanding, it looks like, between the Israeli side and the Syrian side,” Rubio told reporters in the White House.Diplomats said the UN security council would meet on Thursday to address the Syrian conflict.It was unclear how the autonomy of Sweida would be affected by the days of clashes. Though Sharaa’s speech said the military would be withdrawing, it made no mention of members of general security, Syria’s equivalent to gendarmes.View image in fullscreenTrump and Rubio speak to Sharaa and other Middle East dignitaries during a meeting in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, in May.Photograph: Bandar al-Jaloud/Saudi Royal Palace/AFP/Getty ImagesFor months, Sweida has been negotiating its place within the new Syrian state, as the minority Druze have deep misgivings about the new authorities. The clashes exposed rifts between the Druze leadership, with Hijri rejecting any forms of cooperation with Damascus.The clashes also threatened to upset months of diplomatic progress between Israel and Syria after Israel struck for the first time in months.Syrian and Israeli officials had recently met in Baku, Azerbaijan, for security coordination discussions, and Syria’s leadership said it could eventually be open for normalisation with its southern neighbour.The clashes provoked anger among the Druze population in Israel. Dozens of Israeli Druze broke through the border fence on Wednesday.The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said the Israeli military was working to help the Druze and urged Israeli Druze citizens not to cross the border.The Israeli military said it was working to safely return civilians who had crossed.Explore more on these topicsSyriaIsraelMiddle East and north AfricaUS foreign policyMarco RubionewsShareReuse this content"

Charred bodies were taken to the province’s forensic department.Ali Kadhim, 51, said he had been shuttling between the mall and the main hospital where the victims were taken, looking for his cousin, who is missing along with his wife and three children. Back at the mall, he waited anxiously as rescuers searched for victims in the wreckage with an ambulance on standby. “We don’t know what happened to them,” he said.The interior ministry said in a statement: “The tragic fire claimed the lives of 61 innocent citizens, most of whom suffocated in bathrooms, and among them 14 charred bodies yet to be identified.”The official INA news agency later quoted a medical source who put the toll at 63 dead and 40 injured.The provincial governor of Wasit, Mohammed al-Miyahi, told INA the victims included men, women and children. A medical source in Kut said there were “many unidentified bodies”.View image in fullscreenA fire truck stands next to the burned remains of the mall.Photograph: Ahmed Saad/ReutersCivil defence teams rescued more than 45 people who were trapped inside the building, which includes a restaurant and a supermarket, the interior ministry said.The ward of the main hospital was overwhelmed, while elsewhere, distraught relatives waited at the forensic department for news, some collapsing in grief. One man fell apart, pounding his chest and screaming.Nasir al-Quraishi, a doctor in his 50s, said he lost five family members in the fire. “A disaster has befallen us,” he said. “We went to the mall to have some food, eat dinner and escape power cuts at home. An air conditioner exploded on the second floor and then the fire erupted – and we couldn’t escape.”Moataz Karim, 45, rushed to the mall at midnight, to be met with the news that three of his relatives were missing. Hours later, he identified the charred bodies of two relatives, one of whom had begun working at the shopping centre three days ago. “There is no fire extinguishing system,” he said angrily, as he waited for further news outside the forensic department.Safety standards in Iraq’s construction sector are often disregarded and the country, whose infrastructure is in disrepair after decades of conflict, often experiences fatal fires and accidents. Fires increase during the blistering summer, as temperatures approach 50C.In September 2023,a fire killed at least 100 peoplewhen it ripped through a crowded Iraqi wedding hall, sparking a panicked rush for the exits. In July 2021,a fire in the Covid unit of a hospitalin southern Iraq killed more than 60 people.Miyahi said local authorities would file a lawsuit against the mall’s owner and the building contractor. “The tragedy is a major shock … and requires a serious review of all safety measures,” he said.The government declared three days of mourning. Mohammed Shia al-Sudani, the prime minister, ordered a thorough investigation into the fire to identify shortcomings and prevent further incidents.Explore more on these topicsIraqMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Moments afterwards, the London-bound plane lost altitude and crashed, killing 241 people on board and 19 people on the ground.The preliminary report, by India’s aviation authority, made no recommendations for action against Boeing, which manufactures the 787 Dreamliner. However, after the report’s release, AirIndiaordered that the locking mechanisms of all fuel control switches – designed to prevent them from being accidentally turned off in-flight – on its Boeing planes be examined as a precautionary measure.On Thursday, an official from Air India confirmed that “inspections have been completed and no issues were found”.According toa report by the Wall Street Journal (WSJ), an early assessment made by US officials indicated that investigators were now focusing on the actions of the plane’s captain, Sumeet Sabharwal, a veteran pilot who it said is believed to have been the one who moved the fuel switches to cut off.The black-box recording is reported to indicate that it was the plane’s first officer, Clive Kunder, who was flying the aircraft during take-off and had questioned why the pilot had moved the fuel switches to cut off. Sabharwal had replied that he had not.The WSJ cited what it said were people familiar with US officials’ early assessment of evidence uncovered in the crash investigation as saying that Kunder, the first officer, had panicked, while the captain had remained calm.The sources cited by the WSJ did not state if the action was believed to be deliberate or accidental. It was reported that US officials believed criminal investigators should also be involved in looking into the incident.The WSJ did not name the sources it interviewed and Indian authorities have not attributed any fault in their preliminary investigation.India’s preliminary report had summarised the exchange between the pilot and the first officer but had not attributed the quotes. A direct transcript of the recorded discussion has not yet been published by officials.The fuel switches were moved back on seconds after, and one of the engines restarted, but it was not enough to reverse the plane’s deceleration. A “mayday, mayday, mayday” message was transmitted to air traffic control before the plane hit the ground, just 32 seconds after it had left the runway.The Federation of Indian Pilots strongly criticised the WSJ report as “baseless”, accusing it of attempting to blame the pilot.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

When 85% of the UK population lives in built-up urban areas, it is our duty to reach them.”The partnership points out that over the past decade, cuts to local authority spending mean that green spaces have been neglected.Two-thirds of households in England, for example, do not have access to a decent-sized green space within a 15-minute walk of home.Areas benefiting from the first round of funding include Portsmouth in the south of England, Fife in south-eastScotlandand Port Talbot in south Wales.Ealing in west London will receive almost £1m to ready the borough for the creation of a 586-hectare (1,448-acre) regional park. In Lewisham, south-east London, projects will focus on historically underserved Black, African and Caribbean communities.A greening permit scheme modelled after“le permis de végétaliser”in Paris is to be launched in Bristol, allowing residents and associations to cultivate public spaces.In Bradford, West Yorkshire, where life expectancy can differ by 11 years between urban and rural wards, grant money will be used to increase nature-based social-prescribing.North Lanarkshire in central Scotland will use its new funds to create an environmental justice map, pinpointing areas of greatest need, while in Belfast funds will be spent on initiatives including improving the city’s network of alleys, and areas around its peace walls.As part of the announcement, Birmingham was declared the UK’s first “nature city” and Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole in Dorset (BCP) collectively named the first “nature towns”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Borrowers will also be able to complain to the financial ombudsman service if something goes wrong.Sarah Pritchard, the FCA’s deputy chief executive, said the regulator had wanted to police the sector for some time, amid rapid growth in demand for this type of loan.According to the regulator, BNPL lending has grown from £60m in 2017 to more than £13bn in 2024. Now “people can benefit from BNPL while being protected”, said Pritchard.The loans are a way to spread the cost of purchases without paying interest, with the payment option, offered by lenders such as Klarna and Clearpay, regularly popping up at online checkouts.But concerns have been raised that some people could end up taking out loans that they cannot afford to pay back on time, incurring charges. The biggest users of BNPL are adults aged 25-34, with the cohort also skewed to those living in the most deprived areas of the UK.The FCA said BNPL, although unregulated, had entered the mainstream as 10.9 million UK adults had used it at least once in the 12 months to May 2024. Of this group, 1.1 million had a debt of £500 or more outstanding, and 5.3 million owed £50 or more.The FCA intends to make BNPL loans of under £50 subject to new creditworthiness checks. Just over half of these loan agreements involve advances below £50, so ignoring them could leave “borrowers exposed to harm”, it said. Without this scrutiny there is also a risk that “loan stacking” – taking out loans from multiple providers – would not be covered by regulation.Vikki Brownridge, the chief executive of the debt charity StepChange, said that as BNPL was now “as common as using an overdraft” among UK adults, it required “proper” regulation.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They have six months to apply from when the regime comes into force on 15 July 2026.The proposals are set out in a consultation document, and BNPL lenders and consumer groups have until 26 September to respond.Explore more on these topicsBuy now, pay laterBorrowing & debtFinancial Conduct AuthorityRegulatorsConsumer affairsnewsShareReuse this content"

Results of the survey, which takes place from 18 July to 10 August, can be logged on the Butterfly Conservation charity’s website or via its free app.Naturalists say it has been an “outstanding” summer for butterflies and other flying insects but the Big Butterfly Count will determine whether it has been better than average or simply a return to normal after the dismal,butterfly-less summer of 2024.Rare butterfly hits purple patch at Sussex rewilding projectRead moreFine and sunny weather in April and May ensured caterpillars prospered and there have been large andunusually earlyemergences of midsummer butterflies including peacocks, gatekeepers and marbled whites. Butterflies have also been seen farther north than ever before as a result of global heating, with theboomingpurple emperor spotted in North Yorkshire and thewhite-letter hairstreak– which only reached Scotland in 2017 – now found in Dundee.“It’s an outstanding year for most, but not all, butterflies and many other winged insects,” said Matthew Oates, a naturalist and butterfly expert. “It’s all the more remarkable after last year’s insect nadir, which was by far the worst insect trough in my experience of nearly 70 years of butterflying. I was seriously worried.”Butterfly Conservationdeclared a “butterfly emergency” after last summer’s Big Butterfly Count revealed the lowest numbers in its history. The UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme, the gold standard of scientific butterfly surveying, which has been collecting data since 1976, also reported thesecond-lowest numbers of common butterfly speciesin 2024 since records began.Chart showing declines in butterfly species in 2024 by countries of the UKDr Richard Fox of Butterfly Conservation said this year was much more encouraging but warned of “shifting baseline syndrome” whereby people became used to lower numbers of butterflies and so considered what might actually only be a moderately good or average summer to be an abundant one.“I’ve been in Cornwall and there were loads of butterflies around – red admirals, peacocks, gatekeepers, and the whites are doing well,” said Fox. “There are two big ‘buts’: a better summer for butterflies does not redress the 50 years of decline, and we know that drought isn’t good for butterflies or moths or anything that eats plants. The impact of this year’s dry weather will be on the next generation of butterflies, and drought is not good news.”The sunniest spring on record and continued sunny weather through the summer have been a boon for many species, and in many regions there has been just enough rain to prevent caterpillar food plants shrivelling up and dying.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

The brown hairstreak, which is usually an August butterfly and the last species to take to the wing as a butterfly each summer, was spotted in Surrey and Sussex in June. Lepidopterists expect that some species, such as the white admiral and the small pearl-bordered fritillary, may have unusual second or third broods this summer because they emerged so early.But a few of Britain’s 59 native species of butterfly have not fared well this year, including the rarelarge blueand common species such as the ringlet. The large blue is susceptible to dry springs, while the ringlet requires damp conditions for its grass-feeding caterpillars, and struggles in dry summers. The once-ubiquitous small tortoiseshell continues its baffling disappearance from southern Britain, where it has become a rare butterfly.Up to 100,000 citizen scientists who take part in the Big Butterfly Count each summer provide “quality data about how butterflies are doing beyond the nature reserves that are monitored every week”, said Fox. “Taking that 15 minutes just to spend time in nature, to stop worrying about the day-to-day grind and focus on things of beauty, we know is good for our brains and it’s good for mental wellbeing. It’s something that everyone can do and it gives us a bit of agency when faced with these huge threats to our precious natural environment.”Explore more on these topicsButterfliesInsectsConservationWildlifenewsShareReuse this content"

My comments in the interview … were factually correct, as any fair-minded person would accept.”In theinterview with the BBCearlier on Thursday, Abbott, the first black woman elected to parliament, had said: “Clearly, there must be a difference between racism which is about colour and other types of racism because you can see a Traveller or a Jewish person walking down the street, you don’t know.“I just think that it’s silly to try and claim that racism which is about skin colour is the same as other types of racism. I don’t know why people would say that.”The suspension was the latest sign that the prime minister intends to take a tougher approach to party discipline after being forced to U-turn over controversial welfare cuts after a massive rebellion by his MPs.He insisted on Thursday that he will not be “deflected” from his mission to reform Britain after suspending the whip from four Labour MPs who repeatedly voted against the government, including on welfare reform legislation.Starmer said the suspensions of Rachael Maskell, Neil Duncan-Jordan, Brian Leishman and Chris Hinchliff were not just about a single vote but the result of “repeatedly breaking the whip” and undermining Labour’s ability to fulfil its manifesto.At a joint press conference with the German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, he was asked whether punishing the MPs made him look weak.“We are elected in to change this country for the better, and that means we’ve got to carry through that change, and we’ve got to carry through reforms,” he replied.“I’m determined that we will change this country for the better, for millions of working people, and I’m not going to be deflected from that.“And therefore we had to deal with people who repeatedly break the whip, because everyone was elected as a Labour MP on the manifesto of change and everybody needs to deliver as a Labour government. This is about what we’re doing for the country.”Abbott, who has the honorary title mother of the house as the longest-serving female MP in the Commons, first made her comments ina letterto the Observer in 2023 and wassuspended from the partyafter Starmer said they were antisemitic.Abbott wrote that Irish, Jewish and Traveller people “undoubtedly experience prejudice”. “This is similar to racism and the two words are often used as if they are interchangeable,” she said.“It is true that many types of white people with points of difference, such as redheads, can experience this prejudice. But they are not all their lives subject to racism.”She swiftly apologised and withdrew the remarks at the time, and was eventually readmitted, after a protracted investigation, in time to stand in the general election.Labour sources said the decision to once again suspend Abbott, one of the most well-known leftwing figures in the country, was made swiftly, and that this time she was not offered an opportunity to retract her remarks.It unleashed an angry response among sections of the party. The veteran John McDonnell said: “It is extremely bizarre that Diane Abbott gets suspended for an interview in which she forthrightly condemns antisemitism and racism in all its forms whilst no action is taken against those thatinserted into Keir Starmer’s recent speechEnoch Powell’s racist language.”Her longstanding ally Shami Chakrabarti said: “People who are writing‘island of strangers’ speechesshould be a bit slow to sit in judgment on Diane Abbott, who has been fighting racism all her life.”Angela Rayner said she was disappointed that Abbott had defended the comments, saying there was “no place for antisemitism” within Labour.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Rayner said it was “not good” the MP had sought to back away from her earlier apology.A Labour party spokesperson said: “Diane Abbott has been administratively suspended from the Labour party, pending an investigation. We cannot comment further while this investigation is ongoing.”In her BBC interview, Abbott said she felt “a bit weary” of people labelling her antisemitic. She had “spent a lifetime fighting racism of all kinds and in particular fighting antisemitism, partly because of the nature of my constituency”. Her northLondonconstituency of Hackney North and Stoke Newington is home to a large Jewish population.View image in fullscreenDiane Abbott said she had ‘tremendous support locally’ in her constituency when she was suspended the first time, with a ‘big rally on the steps of Hackney town hall’.Photograph: Guy Smallman/Getty ImagesAsked whether she felt she had been “hung out to dry” by the Labour leadership during the disciplinary process relating to her remarks, she said: “In the end, Keir Starmer had to restore the whip to me.“I got tremendous support locally. We had a big rally on the steps of Hackney town hall. And in the end Keir Starmer and the people around him had to back off because of the support I had from the community.”Abbott was readmitted to the party and allowed to stand as a Labour candidate after party officials failed to broker a deal by which she would get the whip back in return for standing down. The row dominated the early days of the general election campaign.The decision to suspend the four other MPs also sparked a backlash from parts of the Labour left. Maskell publicly criticised the move. “On this occasion, I don’t think he’s got it right,” she told the BBC. “There needs to be a better reach-out to backbenchers to ensure that we are the safeguards of our government.”Before her own suspension, Abbott criticised the treatment of backbenchers and called for more space for MPs to raise concerns about policy. Writing on social media, she said: “Silencing dissent is not leadership. It’s control.”A senior Labour figure expressed frustration at what they saw as inconsistent discipline, telling the Guardian: “There were other ministers who helped stir this rebellion – including one who actively encouraged colleagues to sign the amendment. Why are they allowed to carry on?”But Jess Phillips, a Home Office minister, defended the move, saying the MPs involved should not be surprised by the consequences. “There has to be an element of discipline otherwise you end up not being able to govern,” she told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.“Constantly taking to the airwaves and slagging off your own government – I have to say, what did you think was going to happen?”Explore more on these topicsDiane AbbottLabourRaceLondonnewsShareReuse this content"

Others were treated at the scene.The coach overturned on its roof and slid 6 metres (20ft) down an embankment. An off-duty firefighter was following the coach and began helping the children and adults from the vehicle. Some of the passengers were trapped in the coach and had to be freed by firefighters.Many of the children who did not need hospital treatment spent around five hours at a makeshift rest centre before being ferried back to Minehead middle school where parents gathered to pick them up.Ch Supt Mark Edgington of Avon and Somerset police said: “Shortly before 3pm this afternoon, emergency services were called to a collision involving a coach on the A396 at Cutcombe Hill, in Exmoor.“Approximately 60 to 70 people were believed to be onboard. A major incident was declared, with police, fire and ambulance services dispatching crews to the scene.“A number of other people have presented or been taken to hospital, some of them with serious injuries. This includes two children who were taken to hospital by air ambulance. An investigation into the cause of the incident will be carried out.”He asked people not to speculate on the cause of the crash, saying it would add to the distress of “the families, staff and the driver”.The prime minister said he is being kept up to date and thanked emergency workers. In a post on X, Keir Starmer said there were “no adequate words to acknowledge the death of a child. All my thoughts are with their parents, family and friends, and all those affected.”Wayne Darch, deputy director of operations at South Western ambulance service, said it sent 46 resources to the scene. He said the child, who has not been named, died at the scene.Gavin Ellis, the chief fire officer for Devon and Somerset fire and rescue service, said it sent 60 personnel. “Our crews carried out a number of extrications and rescues in extremely difficult circumstances,” he said.The area the crash happened in is heavily wooded and the embankment the coach went down steep.Ellis said: “This was a very complex and technically difficult operation. I’m grateful to the off-duty firefighter who was travelling behind the coach at the point of the crash who was able to start making immediate effect to release those casualties from the bus.”The coach company Ridlers said one of its 70-seat vehicles was involved.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

When the Florida legislature redrew the map in 2021, DeSantis went out of his way to chop up the district into four different ones in which white people comprised a majority. DeSantis said at the time that the district, which stretched more than 200 miles from Tallahassee to Jacksonville, had impermissibly sorted voters based on their race.The decision helped Republicans pick up additional seats inFlorida. Thursday’s ruling is a win for Republicans, who anticipate losing seats in the US House in next year’s midterm elections.How Ron DeSantis waged a targeted assault on Black voters: ‘I fear for what’s to come’Read moreBlack voters and advocacy groups challenged the map, saying getting rid of the district violated one of several anti-gerrymandering provisions, known as the Fair Districts Amendment (FDA), approved by voters in 2010. One of those protections prohibits lawmakers from drawing districts that “diminish [racial and language minorities’] ability to elect representatives of their choice”. Eliminating a district in which Black voters were electing their preferred candidate, the plaintiffs argued, violated that provision.A circuit court judgesided with the plaintiffsand struck down the map in May 2022. An appellate courtreversedthat decision.Chief justice Carlos Muñiz, a DeSantis appointee, wrote the majority opinion and agreed that the old district was one in which Black voters could elect their preferred candidate and that the new map diminished their ability to do so. But, he added, the relevant question was whether it was possible to draw districts that complied with the non-diminishment requirement without allowing race to predominate. The plaintiffs, he said, had not proven that was possible.“The record leaves no doubt that such a district would be race-predominant. The record also gives us no reasonable basis to think that further litigation would uncover a potentially viable remedy,” he wrote. “It is likely impossible to draw a non-diminishing district … in North Florida without subordinating the FDA’s mandatory race-neutral districting standards.”“There’s no doubt that this opinion dramatically limits the reach of the FDA,” said Chris Shenton, a lawyer with the Southern Coalition for Social Justice, which represented plaintiffs challenging the maps in a separate case.Justice Jorge Labarga wrote in a dissenting opinion that the case should have been sent back down to a lower court where the plaintiffs should have been given the chance to prove such a map was possible. The supreme court’s Thursday decision, he wrote, “lays the groundwork for future decisions that may render the Non-Diminishment Clause practically ineffective or, worse, unenforceable as a matter of law”.Explore more on these topicsFloridaThe fight for democracyUS politicsUS CongressnewsShareReuse this content"

Now Hawaii is emerging as another possible victimDara KerrThu 17 Jul 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 17 Jul 2025 18.25 EDTShareThe north-westHawaiianisland of Mokumanamana is said to be touched by the gods. Bisected by the Tropic of Cancer latitude line, it is deep in the Pacific Ocean, about 400 miles from Honolulu. The island’s steep rocky cliffs give way to indigo blue waters dotted with monk seals and stony coral. No humans have lived on Mokumanamana, but it has the world’s highest density of ancient Hawaiian religious sites.“It sits as a boundary between what Native Hawaiians refer to as ‘pō’, the darkness, and ‘au’, the light,” said William Aila, the former chair of Hawaii’s department of land and natural resources. “When a Hawaiian passes, their soul makes its way from wherever it is in the main Hawaiian Islands, up to the North-western Hawaiian Islands. And at that juncture, at pō, they’re met by their ancestors.” As Aila tells it, if a person has been good, they can pass intopōand be with their ancestors, who inhabit the Pacific waters west of Mokumanamana.The hundreds of miles of ocean that surround Mokumanamana and other Hawaiian islands are now under threat, according to environmentalists and scientists. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the agency that oversees air and space travel in the US, announced in May that it had givenElon Muskpermission to detonate rocket ships from his companySpaceXover these protected waters.SpaceX first brought its request, a proposal called the Starship Super Heavy Project, to the FAA in 2022. In 2023, the company was given a license to launch its massive Starship rocket five times a year. In 2024, Musk proposed quintupling that number to 25 a year. SpaceX’s launch base is located in Boca Chica, Texas,surrounded by a state parkand federal wildlife refuge. To date, 10 Starship rockets have attempted to take off from there, the majority of which have ended in scattershot explosions, blasting metal shrapnel and debris from the Gulf of Mexico to the Indian Ocean.In conjunction with the increased number of launches, Musk proposed expanding the area in the Pacific Ocean where debris from his exploded Starships can land by roughly 75 times its original scope. This new area encompasses vast regions throughout the Pacific, including around the eight main Hawaiian islands, Mokumanamana and the entire north-west Hawaiian chain of islands – which lie within the Papahānaumokuākea marine national monument, a Unesco world heritage site.A map showing SpaceX’s expansion into the PacificThe monument is considered one of the most ecologically unique and diverse areas in the world, with 7,000 species of birds, turtles, marine mammals, fish and coral, some of which are critically endangered. It is also the largest protected area on Earth, covering nearly 600,000 sq miles of water. Ancestors of modern Hawaiians explored the open ocean here, navigating by stars. During Joe Biden’s final days in office, his administrationdesignated the monument as a sanctuary, giving it enhanced legal protections.OnceSpaceXramps up launches, bird and sea life could face hazardous material spills, falling objects and sonic booms, according to thousands of pages of government documents reviewed by the Guardian and interviews with more than a dozen people, including oceanographers, aerospace engineers, former government employees, lawyers and Hawaiian residents. They fear Musk’s “fail fast” approach to rocket launches, along with his ties to the US government, could mean SpaceX will have free rein over the region. Many in Hawaii say the FAA’s review of potential environmental consequences is not thorough enough.“We, especially as Native Hawaiians who have a special relationship to that place, simply want an honest and true assessment of the risk before consenting to the raining of thousands of pieces of a failed rocket,” said Aila, who is also the former chair of Papahānaumokuākea’s advisory council.Before and after map of the splashdown site for Starship rockets near HawaiiMusk, the world’s richest person, has framed his SpaceX expansion plan as existential, crucial to the survival of the human race. One day in the not-so-distant future, he says, the development of SpaceX’s Starship rocket will culminate in his ultimate goal of colonizing the planet Mars.Starship is the largest and most powerful spaceship ever built, standing 40 stories tall when all its parts stack. It’s designed to eventually be fully reusable and comes equipped with a Super Heavy booster and engines that burn methane gas and liquid oxygen. Musk originallycodenamed itBFR (Big Fucking Rocket).“Starship is the first design of a rocket that is actually capable of making life multiplanetary,” Musk said in aspeechlast year. “We don’t want to be one of those lame one-planet civilizations. We want to be a multiplanetary civilization, ultimately be a multi-stellar civilization, be out there among the stars.”For Musk, the cost of harming the delicate ocean ecosystem is outweighed by the benefits of space exploration.“If the [Starship] did hit a whale, it’s like, honestly, that whale had it coming, cause the odds are so low,” Musksaid in Octoberwhile campaigning for Donald Trump. “It’s like Final Destination: The Whale Edition. It’s like fate had it in for that whale.”Musk, SpaceX and the White House did not return requests for comment.Sonic booms, oil spills and damaged birds’ nestsWhen a Starship detonates and plunges to the sea, there are three possible outcomes, according to the FAA. First, it could have a hard landing at “terminal velocity”, which would cause the rocket to break apart on impact creating an “explosive event” on the water’s surface. Second, it could have a “soft water landing and tip over and sink”. Or lastly, the rocket could break up during atmosphere re-entry, causing debris to scatter across the ocean.In the run-up to the FAA’s approval of SpaceX’s 25 launches a year, federal agencies that work with endangered species issued biological opinions on the possible impact of these three scenarios.View image in fullscreenA juvenile green sea turtle in the Papahānaumokuākea marine national monument, which is home to more than 7,000 marine species.Photograph: NOAA/AlamyThe National Marine Fisheries Service saiddozens of species would be “affected”, including various species of whale, turtle, seal, fish, shark, coral and other ocean life. The agency specifically pointed to three types of sea turtle – green, Kemp’s ridley and loggerhead – as being “adversely affected”. Those adverse effects could come from things like sonic booms, falling debris and fuel and oil spills, according to the agency.In its biological opinion, the Fish and Wildlife Service retraced what went wrong during Starship’s first seven test launches in Boca Chica, Texas. The first launch pulverized the launchpad and sent chunks of concrete flying several miles throughout the wildlife refuge. The second flight went without incident, but the third ignited two brush fires, and the fourth tossed metal sheeting into the surrounding state park and damaged eggs in nine birds’ nests. The following three flights resulted in singed vegetation, a tornado-like “gravel plume” and the carcasses of a black-necked stilt and brown pelican.Despite the federal agencies’ foreboding assessments, they concluded the impact from twice-monthly Starship launches would probably be rare, and thus “insignificant”. The Fish and Wildlife Service declined to provide further comment. A spokesperson for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa), which heads the marine fisheries service, said it recommended conservation measures, like gathering acoustic data on explosions and monitoring falling debris.The FAA came to the same “no significant impact” conclusion in its final90-page environmental assessmentof SpaceX’s proposal. The agency acknowledged the potential threats but said they would be infrequent and the risk was low. As a result, the FAA approved a five-year license for 25 Starship launches a year and allowed for the vast zone in the Pacific to be a debris “action area”. If rocket detritus falls outside the permitted zone, the FAA or other federal agencies may investigate, though the approval does not delineate specific penalties.Small multiple chart showing how Space X can now launch 25 rockets per yearThe FAA assessment bears a major caveat, though: it was in effect prepared by SpaceX itself. SpaceX employees and consultants from the firm SWCA, hired by SpaceX, authored the 90-page document, according to its list of preparers. Four FAA employees were listed as “independent evaluators”. A separate 106-page biological assessment the FAA used to evaluate Starship’s impact on endangered species was also prepared by another company hired by SpaceX, the defense contractor ManTech SRS Technologies.An FAA spokesperson said applicants may prepare environmental assessments (EA) for the agency, and if they do, “the FAA advises and assists the applicant during preparation of the EA and independently evaluates and takes responsibility for the EA before it is published.”This environmental assessment, which wasfirst published in 2022and later updated, is the crux of a lawsuit brought against the FAA by a coalition of non-profits. They say the assessment was not sufficient and violates the National Environmental Policy Act. The coalition is calling for the FAA to conduct what’s known as anEnvironmental Impact Statement, which would require a more rigorous review of SpaceX’s impact to endangered species as well as consultation with Native Hawaiians and other cultural groups.“These documents were all put together by SpaceX, and then the FAA just sort of signed off on them as its own work,” said Jill Heaps, the senior legal director for the Surfrider Foundation, which is part of the coalition. “It’s the FAA’s duty to take a hard look at the potentially significant impacts to marine life … They’re asking for a very large geographic area in which these pieces can be dumped into the ocean, some of which might be near the Rice’s whale, some of which are near very sensitive areas around Hawaii.”View image in fullscreenMidway Atoll and its surrounding reef in the Papahānaumokuākea marine national monument.Photograph: ZUMA Press, Inc./AlamyWhen asked why the FAA didn’t issue an impact statement, the agency spokesperson said the assessment “provides a full discussion of the reasonably foreseeable effects of issuing a license for SpaceX’s proposed operations”.Rockets are a conglomeration of materials, such as heavy metals, plastics, wiring and chemicals. When one explodes, it typically breaks into several separate pieces, said Ella Atkins, a professor and department head of aerospace and ocean engineering at Virginia Tech. “That includes the shell on the outside, and the fuel tanks and the engines and all of the piping … Whatever fuel that is still remaining that is unburned will come down wherever it is.”The big stainless steel side panels of the rocket could float for a while and be retrieved before they eventually sink, said Atkins. The denser pieces, like parts of the engine, would immediately plummet to the sea floor. She said all three of the explosive scenarios laid out by the FAA could harm marine life.Discarding those materials into the water could also have unforeseen consequences, said Britta Baechler, the director of ocean plastics research for the environmental non-profit Ocean Conservancy. Damaging a coral reef could kill not only the coral, but the ecosystem that depends on it, everything from marine mammals and birds to the fish they survive on, she said.“Throughout history, we’ve looked at the ocean as a dumping ground, like it’s too big to fail, like ‘the solution to pollution is dilution,’” Baechler said. “And that’s really not the case.”‘Success is uncertain, but entertainment is guaranteed’SpaceX has an extensive history of scattering rocket ship debris into the ocean. In the early days of the company, it struggled to find permission to launch its rockets. So, in 2005, the company set its sights on a tiny, remote atoll in the Marshall Islands, called Kwajalein.In the four years SpaceX spent in Kwajalein, the company successfully launched two of its small Falcon 1 rockets for the first time. But it took several failures to get there. The inaugural Falcon 1 launch ended in a blaze with the rocket plummeting into the ocean, showering burning debris across a nearby coral reef. According to an account by Wired published in 2007, the spaceship’s payloadbarreled through the roof of SpaceX’s own machine shop, and a fuel slick spread offshore. The company said it retrieved 75% of the detonated debris.Since then, SpaceX has made tremendous strides. It has launched hundreds of Falcon rockets and is now responsible for delivering cargo and crew to and from the International Space Station. The company says it has also sent more than 7,800 Starlink satellites into orbit, more than half of all active satellites in space.View image in fullscreenElon Musk gives Donald Trump and lawmakers a tour of the SpaceX control room in Texas before a Starship test flight in November 2024.Photograph: Brandon Bell/ReutersStarship is SpaceX’s new frontier – a rocket built with the goal of making it to Mars – but it’s still a work in progress. The majority of its 10 test flights have encountered fatal errors, with the entire ship engulfed in flames and scant parts left to be reused.Musk has a “fail fast, learn faster” approach to his companies. As far back as 2005, shortly before SpaceX got set up in KwajaleinMusk said in an interviewthat, “There’s a silly notion that failure’s not an option at Nasa. Failure is an option here. If things are not failing, you are not innovating enough.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The colossal spaceship took off from Boca Chica, but quickly suffered engine failure. Just above the Earth, the rocketstarted to spin out of control, and SpaceX was forced to detonate the ship. The problemstarted during takeoff, when Starship demolished its launchpad, pulverizing it, sending hunks of concrete flying six miles away.The blast ignited a grassfire that burned nearly four acres of state park and, from what is known, it destroyed a nest of bobwhite quail eggs and a collection of blue land crabs, according tointernal emails Bloomberg obtainedfrom the Fish and Wildlife Service. The loud boom also sent a pair of endangered snowy plovers fleeing, and, while they were gone, a wildlife scientist’s “game camera” caught a coyote eating two of their three nest eggs.The FAA blamed the failure on “multiple root causes” andcited 63 actionsSpaceX needed to implement, including the redesign of Starship’s hardware to prevent leaks and fires as well as the redesign of its launchpad. According to the biography Elon Musk by Walter Isaacson, when SpaceX first built the launchpad in 2020, Musk demanded it not have a flame trench dug underneath the mount, as most pads have.View image in fullscreenSpaceX’s Starship explodes during its first test launch on 20 April 2023.Photograph: Joe Skipper/Reuters“We don’t want to design to eliminate every risk,” Musk told Isaacson after the episode. “Otherwise, we will never get anywhere.”In 2025 alone, four more of SpaceX’s Starship rockets exploded. The first, in January, ignited into a fireball that lit up the sky from the Bahamas to Haiti. The FAA needed toreroute dozens of commercial airline flightsto avoid falling debris. Afterwards, residents of Turks and Caicos said their islands werelittered with spacecraft remains. SpaceX had originally planned a “controlled splashdown” in the Indian Ocean an hour after takeoff, but the explosion happened just nine minutes into Starship’s journey.“Success is uncertain, but entertainment is guaranteed!” Muskposted to X.Then, in March, May and June, more Starships exploded.The May blast ended with heaps of debris, including combustion tanks and metal and plastic fragments,washing up on Playa Bagdadin Matamoros, Mexico – putting in jeopardy thousands of hatchling Kemp’s ridley sea turtles,according to environmental groups. The Mexican president, Claudia Sheinbaum, sent government officials to the beach to survey the damage. Meanwhile, the June Starship went up in flames. Days later, Sheinbaumthreatened to sue SpaceX, concluding “there is indeed contamination” on Playa Bagdad.Billions in government funding and cuts to federal agenciesIn mid-January, the FAA held a virtual meeting on Musk’s Starship plan that was open to the public. Texas and Hawaii residents logged on, most of whom were deeply opposed to the project. Lynda Williams, a retired physics professor and activist who lives in Hilo, Hawaii, was the first to speak. She had been trying for months to get word out about Musk’s plans andwrote an op-edemphasizing the fact that Hawaii residents and officials hadn’t been consulted.During the meeting, Williams said she focused her comments on the idea that “Earth is not a sacrifice zone for Elon Musk’s ego trip to Mars”. She said she wanted to “shred his [talking point about], you know, ‘we have to extend the light of consciousness and go to fucking Mars’, which is just a whole Trojan-Horse bullshit lie”.View image in fullscreenA Starship rocket explodes during a SpaceX test launch on 18 June 2025.Photograph: rocketfuture.org via APSeveral meeting participants spoke about the fact that SpaceX is a private commercial company using public resources for profit. The aerospace giant has received billions in government contracts and stands to be awarded much more. Themajority of its fundingis from Nasa and the Department of Defense. According to a Nasa spokesperson, the agency has invested more than $16bn in SpaceX through numerous contracts.The FAA also opened a written public comment period, and more than 12,000 comments poured in over a two-month period that ended on 17 January. Comments flowed from south Texas, where residents havelived with rumbling SpaceX launchesand their deafening booms for half a decade. “It is terrifying for residents to wake up to what feels like earthquakes,” said one commenter. Another pleaded, “Please stop the destruction of our lands for profit.”Some people voiced support for the project, including dozens who used the same template to argue that quintupling rocket launches would help in “maintaining American leadership in space relative to global competitors like China”. Several local suppliers also sent identical letters, but using their own letterhead.Just three days after the FAA closed the comment period on SpaceX’s proposal, Trump was inaugurated president. One of his first official acts was to sign anexecutive orderestablishing the so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge). Trump anointed Musk the de-facto leader – essentially handing him control over the personnel of the federal agencies meant to regulate his businesses.Michael Whitaker, the FAA chief, stepped down that same day. He had long been in the crosshairs of Musk, especially after the agencyfined SpaceX $633,000last September for allegedly violating its launch license over safety protocols. Muskwrote on Xthat he was suing the FAA for “regulatory overreach” andthat“the fundamental problem is that humanity will forever be confined to Earth unless there is radical reform at the FAA!” Days later, MuskpostedWhitaker “needs to resign”.Since then, with the backing of Trump, Doge hasfired hundreds of FAA employees. It has alsolaid off thousands of scientistswithdeep cutsto Noaa and the Fish and Wildlife Service, both of which manage Papahānaumokuākea.View image in fullscreenRed-tailed tropicbirds fly over the Papahānaumokuākea marine national monument.Photograph: White House Photo/AlamyThe relationship between Trump and Musk has frayed, but Trump has continued to slash funding for environmental projects and attack regulatory bodies that protect the environment. In the Pacific, he has signed executive orders thatallow for deep sea miningandopen up the Pacific Islands Heritage marine national monument, which is adjacent to Papahānaumokuākea, for commercial fishing.“The government is doing a number of things trying to reduce the influence and impact of environmental laws,” said Aila, the former chair of Papahānaumokuākea’s advisory council. “Who does that benefit? It benefits Elon Musk. And that should be a huge ethical issue.”‘The ocean is vast and cannot be avoided’Ancestors of the Hawaiians pioneered ocean exploration by the stars. But their culture of reverence could not be more different than Musk’s “fail fast” approach to space exploration.“It’s really easy to portray Indigenous Hawaiian ideals as anti-science, but I don’t think it’s that way at all,” said Kau’inohea Wawae’iole, a college student and resident of Puna, Hawaii, who said he was dismayed when he heard about SpaceX’s plans. “I think it’s just that we have a really deep connection to this place.”Similarly, when Kyle Kajihiro heard about the waters around Papahānaumokuākea being used as a place to dump rocket debris, he said he was reminded of how the Pacific has been treated for centuries. He’s an assistant professor of ethnic studies at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, whose family originally emigrated from Japan and has lived in Hawaii for five generations.“There’s a kind of way that the Pacific Ocean, Hawaii and other islands in the Pacific have been imagined by the powerful countries around the world as a kind of empty space,” Kajihiro said. “It’s like it’s this vast ocean with these tiny, remote specs that are insignificant. And so, that smallness and that idea of remoteness and isolation and distance means that the area can be used in this way.”In the lead-up to the FAA granting approval for SpaceX’s plan, the agency received a deluge of critical letters from local government bureaus, environmental groups and scientists, according to documents reviewed by the Guardian. One of those groups, the Surfrider Foundation, had been focused on SpaceX’s impact in Texas but is now looking at the Pacific too.View image in fullscreenA critically endangered Hawaiian monk seal and a Laysan albatross on the Midway Atoll in the Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument.Photograph: Hum Images/Alamy“The [environmental assessment] fails to analyze the impacts of exploding metal rocket pieces or other hazardous materials to sea life, including the ocean water quality, in the vicinity of protected marine habitat, or those that ultimately sink to the sea floor,” Surfrider leaders wrote in their letter, adding that SpaceX has shown no evidence it will avoid areas with endangered species.In response, the FAA told Surfrider its assessment doesn’t say all potential endangered species habitats would be avoided, “as the ocean is vast and cannot be avoided”.The FAA did make a concession, however. With its approval in May, the agency adjusted some of the boundaries where Starship debris is allowed to fall near the main Hawaiian Islands. It also added a 50-mile buffer zone around Papahānaumokuākea. The FAA said it made these revisions based on the outpouring of comments about harm to marine life and Hawaiian cultural resources, like the cluster of ancient religious sites on Mokumanamana.Kajihiro said that even though there are now boundaries around these sacred areas, he’s still concerned that Starship rockets could malfunction and debris will fall there.“They just see this as empty space,” Kajihiro reiterated. “But what Native Hawaiians have helped us to understand, and what other Pacific Island peoples in their history have understood, is that the ocean is really a fabric of connection between all of these civilizations.”Explore more on these topicsTechnologySpaceXElon MuskPacific islandsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Powell has said that lowering rates prematurely could lead to higher inflation, and that Trump’s tariffs had contributed to price increases.In response to the Fed chair’s resistance, Trump has threatened tofire Powellmultiple times.Can Trump fire Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell?Read moreYesterday, after reports that Trump floated the idea of firing Powell to House Republicans, Trump said: “I don’t rule out anything, but I think it’s highly unlikely unless he has to leave for fraud.”The White House budget director, Russell Vought,told reporterson Thursday that the administration wanted to have an on-site inspection of theFed’s troubled$2.5bn building renovations.“I think the president was pretty clear yesterday: he’s unlikely to fire the chairman, but he has substantial concerns with regard to how he’s managed the Fed,” Vought said.Trump faces many challenges to his desire to oust Powell. The supreme court in the spring went out of its way to say that, while Trump has the ability to fire certain officials, like those on national labor boards, the Fed is different.“The Federal Reserve is a uniquely structured, quasi-private entity that follows in the distinct historical tradition of the First and Second Banks of the United States,” the courtsaidin May.Should Trump fire Powell, he is probably setting himself up for a complicated battle with the supreme court.Meanwhile, Wall Street investors appear opposed to Trump firing Powell. US stocks dipped down on Wednesday afternoon directly after reports that Trump was once again floating the idea of firing Powell.“The independence of the Fed is absolutely critical,” the JPMorgan Chase CEO, Jamie Dimon,saidon Tuesday. “Not just for the current Fed chairman, who I respect, but for the next Fed chairman.”But Powell’s term is set to end in May 2026, and Trump appears to be hopeful that recent renovations at the Fed make Powell an easier target. Renovations were initially slated to cost $1.9bn after it was budgeted in 2019, but costs have risen to $2.5bn. The Fed hassaidthe renovations cover two buildings that have “not been comprehensively renovated since their construction in the 1930s”.On Wednesday, Trump said that “it’s possible there’s fraud involved with the $2.5bn”.Trump also said that Powell was a “terrible Fed chair” and that he “was surprised he was appointed”. Trump appointed Powell to the job in 2018. Biden extended Powell’s term in 2022.Explore more on these topicsFederal ReserveDonald TrumpWashington DCJerome PowellnewsShareReuse this content"

McCormick adjourned the trial just as it was to enter its second day and she congratulated the parties.The plaintiffs’ lawyer, Sam Closic, said the agreement came together quickly.Billionaire venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, who is a defendant in the trial and aMetadirector, was scheduled to testify on Thursday.Shareholders of Meta sued Zuckerberg, Andreessen and other former company officials including Sheryl Sandberg, the former chief operating officer, in hopes of holding them liable for billions of dollars in fines and legal costs the company paid in recent years.The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) fined Facebook $5bn in 2019 after finding that it failed to comply with a 2012 agreement with the regulator to protect users’ data.The shareholders wanted the 11 defendants to use their personal wealth to reimburse the company. The defendants denied the allegations, which they called “extreme claims”.Facebook changed its name to Metain 2021. The company was not a defendant.The company declined to comment. A lawyer for the defendants did not immediately respond to a request for comment.“This settlement may bring relief to the parties involved, but it’s a missed opportunity for public accountability,” said Jason Kint, the head of Digital Content Next, a trade group for content providers.Zuckerberg was expected to take the stand on Monday and Sandberg on Wednesday. The trial was scheduled to run through the end of next week.The case was also expected to include testimony from the former Facebook board members Peter Thiel, Palantir Technologies co-founder, and Reed Hastings, co-founder of Netflix .Meta investors alleged in the lawsuit that former and current board members completely failed to oversee the company’s compliance with the 2012 FTC agreement and claim that Zuckerberg and Sandberg knowingly ran Facebook as an illegal data harvesting operation. The case followed revelations that data from millions of Facebook users was accessed by Cambridge Analytica, a now-defunct political consulting firm that worked for Donald Trump’s successful US presidential campaign in 2016. Those revelations led to the FTC fine, which was a record at the time.On Wednesday, an expert witness for the plaintiffs testified about what he called “gaps and weaknesses” in Facebook’s privacy policies but would not say if the company violated the 2012 agreement that Facebook reached with the FTC.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In 2017, Zuckerberg was expected to testify at a trial involving a lawsuit by company investors opposed to his plan to issue a special class of Facebook stock that would have extended his control over that company. That case was also settled before he took the stand.“Facebook has successfully remade the ‘Cambridge Analytica’ scandal about a few bad actors rather than an unraveling of its entire business model of surveillance capitalism and the reciprocal, unbridled sharing of personal data,” Kint said. “That reckoning is now left unresolved.”Explore more on these topicsMetaMark ZuckerbergDelawarenewsShareReuse this content"

They unfold after launch, allowing the bomb to be guided to its target.Revenues from the US company MBDA Incorporated flow through MBDA UK, based in Hertfordshire, England, which then passes any profits to MBDA group, headquartered in France. MBDA distributed almost £350m in dividends last year to its three shareholders – Britain’s biggest defence firmBAE Systems, France’s Airbus and Italy’s Leonardo.In September, the UK foreign secretary, David Lammy, suspended some weapons export licences toIsrael, citing risk of “serious violations” of international humanitarian law. Lammy said the move was designed to target “items which could be used in the current conflict in Gaza”.Using open source information, and analysis by weapons experts, the investigation has verified 24 cases where the GBU-39 was deployed in attacks that left civilians dead. Each one included children among the fatalities. Many of the attacks took place at night, without warning, in school buildings and tent camps where displaced families were sheltering. A number have been examined by theUnited Nationsand the humanitarian group Amnesty International, which flagged them as suspected war crimes.MBDA confirmed it had a contract with Boeing for the wings, and said it “complies all relevant national and international laws applicable to the arms trade in the countries in which it operates … all of whom have export policies and operate robust export control regimes”.Campaigners said the case illustrates the limits of the UK’s move to pause some arms shipments to Israel. Already criticised for excluding F-35 fighter jets, the government’s measures have other limitations: they apply only to military equipment exported from Britain, which means the US arm of MBDA can continue supplying Boeing from its Alabama factory.‘When she walks she is afraid to step on the bodies’Hanin al-Wadie in the fire at Fahmi al-Jarjawi schoolHanin al-Wadie in the fire at Fahmi al-Jarjawi schoolAt about 2am on 26 May this year, a bomb ripped through the roof of Fahmi al-Jarjawi school in the historic quarter ofGazaCity while dozens of families sheltering there lay sleeping. Local emergency services said 36 people, half of them children, were killed that night as the building was engulfed in flames. In a video recorded by an onlooker, a tiny girl, silhouetted against the fire, stumbled forwards as she searched for a way out.The child was five-year-old Hanin al-Wadie, and she survived – just.Weeks later she was still in hospital, suffering second- and third-degree burns, and deep psychological trauma. Her parents and her only sibling, a sister, were killed in the attack.Sitting by her side, as Hanin nibbled on a piece of bread and plucked at her bandages, her uncle Ahmed al-Wadie spoke of what she remembered. “The first thing is that she screamed at the sound of the missiles and the fire around her,” he said. “When she walks, she says she is afraid to step on the bodies. Imagine a child in this situation seeing her parents in front of her in a fire, seeing them with her eyes.”Ahmed, who is a nurse, said she needed treatments that no hospital in Gaza could provide – plastic surgery on her face and her hands, and psychological support. In recent days, he has managed to secure her evacuation to Jordan.View image in fullscreenHanin al-Wadie’s arms. Her uncle says needs treatments that no hospital in Gaza can provide.Photograph: Thaer Maher AabedInternational humanitarian law prohibits attacks on civilian infrastructure such as schools, and requires steps to minimise harm. Failure to follow the rules can result in war crimes. “Those launching attacks have a legal duty to take precautions so as to avoid harming civilians – even in cases where there may be a military target at the location – including by not striking locations full of civilians,” says Donatella Rovera, a senior investigator at Amnesty. Giving effective warning to evacuate, where feasible, is also a requirement. Witnesses said no such warning was given before the attack at Fahmi al-Jarjawi.The Israeli militarysaid at the timeit had targeted a command and control centre inside the school that Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad used to gather intelligence for attacks, adding it had taken “numerous steps” to mitigate the risk of harming civilians, including the use of “precise munitions”. Locating military objectives within densely populated civilian areas is also prohibited, said Rovera.Weapons experts later identified fragments of a GBU-39 bomb in the debris. Footage shot at the scene clearly showed the wings, which often shear off as the bomb hits its target.View image in fullscreenBomb fragments among the debris and ruins.Photograph: Thaer Maher AabedTrevor Ball, an associate at Armaments Research Services, which receives some EU funding, has compiled his own list of strikes involving the bomb. He said it could be identified by its wings, which are marked with the words “NO LIFT ON WINGS” and by its tail piece, which has slots for fins and distinctive bolts.The GBU-39 is reaching Israel under the US military aid programme, which provides grants and loans to be spent on weapons. Bought from the Boeing Company directly, and also transferred from the US military’s own reserves, an estimated 4,800 have been shipped since the 7 October 2023 Hamas massacre of Israeli citizens, to which Israel responded by launching a war on Gaza. The most recent consignment of 2,166 wasannouncedin February of this year, just as the UN reported that almost70% of Gaza had been reduced to rubble.The GBU-39 is launched from the air by fighter jets. With a comparatively light payload of under 250lb, it can take out one or two floors of a building, leaving the rest of the structure intact. Its use has been encouraged by the US state department, including under former president Joe Biden, because it was seen as preferable to the much heavier bombs used to flatten Gaza during the early months of the war.But in an enclosed space, it creates a lethal fireball. In the 24 cases verified for this article, which date from between November 2023 and May of this year, the reported death toll was more than 500, including at least 100 children.The first verified case since the start of the war was on 2 November, at the densely populated Bureij camp, when several buildings collapsed. The UN estimated Israeli jets had launched at least four of the bombs. Gaza authorities initially reported 15 dead, including nine children, though the death toll rose as the days passed. Mourning the loss of 19 members of his family, Yasser Hassan Washah postedon Facebook: “My remaining cousins are searching for their family, and the rest of my cousins are under the rubble.”Later that day, without specifying locations, theIsrael Defense Forces (IDF) statedits aircraft, directed by soldiers on the ground, had struck a number of military command and control centres used by senior Hamas terrorist operatives, some of which were “deliberately located in civilian areas”. In areport published last year, the UN cited the attack as one of six examples in which it said Israel “may have failed to adhere” to the principles of international humanitarian law.Video of the Kuwaiti Peace Camp 1 attackVideo of the Kuwaiti Peace Camp 1 attack.From just a handful of cases verified in 2023, the data suggests the Israeli military dramatically scaled up its use of GBU-39s in 2024. One of the most devastating attacks was during the night of 26 May 2024, when jets bombarded Kuwaiti Peace Camp 1 in Rafah, sparking a raging fire that set rows of tents alight. A toddler and a woman were decapitated by fragments from the explosives,Amnesty reported. The Gaza health ministry counted 45 dead and 249 wounded.The Israeli military said it had beentargeting a Hamas compound, and that it suspected munitions or some other combustible substance it was unaware of caused a secondary explosion and a fire. Amnesty accused the military of failing to distinguish between civilians and military objectives, and called for the incident to be investigated as a war crime.“The GBU-39s have been used a lot to target schools and areas where other people are sheltering,” said Ball.Of the verified attacks, 16 were against schools. While the buildings are no longer functioning as educational facilities, they have become places of shelter for Gaza’s displaced population. The other strikes were on tent camps, family homes, and on a mosque during morning prayers.The Guardian wrote to the IDF with detailed accounts of nine attacks. A spokesperson declined to comment on the individual cases, saying it did not have the time or information needed to examine the claims. However, they insisted the IDF did not target civilians or civilian structures.“The IDF strikes exclusively on the grounds of military necessity and in strict accordance with international law. The IDF pursues all feasible precautions in order to mitigate harm to both civilians and civilian structures.” In each case, it said the sensitivity of sites was taken into account with the aim of mitigating damage to sites and civilians in a “rigorous approval process”. It said Hamas had made a habit of storing its weapons and ammunition inside civilian buildings, including hospitals, schools and mosques, and launched attacks from them routinely.4:12How EU's largest missile maker is selling parts for bombs that have killed children in Gaza – videoArms tradeIn its marketing material for the patented Diamond Back wing system, MBDA describes it as a “key component” of the Boeing bomb. Weapons experts say the GBU-39 is always sold with its wings, and MBDA is the sole known supplier.There are no public financial accounts for MBDA Inc, so the profits and revenues it generates are not visible. However, its revenues are consolidated within the UK division, according to a statement in the accounts. The profits are then passed to MBDA group.The most recent accounts for MBDA UK, which date from 2023, show it is a large part of the business, contributing more than 40% of revenues. Overall, the wider MBDA business is growing rapidly, taking £4.2bn in revenues in 2024.Last September, as the number of people killed in Gaza rose to more than 40,000, Britain’s foreign minister, David Lammy,suspended 29 licencesfor arms exports to Israel, saying there existed a “clear risk” the equipment could be used to commit “serious violations” of international humanitarian law.However, the ban is limited in scope. Experts say the government has no power to block sales by firms based abroad, even if they are part of the same group as a British company.US subsidiary MBDA Inc is not affected by the ban, and it has a separate board of directors. It operates under local laws and is subject to US arms controls.View image in fullscreenPromotional illustration showing MBDA Inc’s Diamond Back wings on a guided bomb.Photograph: MBDA Inc“MBDA are profiting from the arming of Israel,” said Sam Perlo-Freeman, the research coordinator at Campaign Against the Arms Trade. “What MBDA could do if they wanted to not be complicit in arming Israel is they could sell MBDA Inc. We would support the UK government taking all actions that are within their powers to stop the genocide. Beyond an arms embargo, this includes sanctions on companies arming Israel, banning UK investments in such companies.”Such a ban would go beyond even the terms of the embargo imposed on Russia after its attack on Ukraine. With Israel, the UK and other western governments have taken a lighter touch approach. For example, Lammy allowed a carve-out so that British companies, including BAE Systems, could continue producing parts of the F-35 combat aircraft for Israel.Despite strong words and threats of more sanctions after Israel broke the ceasefire in March, andfindings by the UNthat the warfare methods in Gaza are consistent with genocide, European leaders have taken no further steps to prevent domestic armaments firms from profiting.Ina report dated last month, the UN special rapporteur on human rights in the occupied Palestinian territories, Francesca Albanese, examined corporate profits from the conflict. She concluded: “The present report shows why the genocide carried out by Israel continues: because it is lucrative for many.”Neither MBDA nor Boeing are mentioned among the 40 companies named in the report, but Albanese said her research was “just the tip of the iceberg”. “Ending it will not happen without holding the private sector accountable,” she said.View image in fullscreenThe business and trade secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, visits MBDA in Bolton.Photograph: Department for Business and TradeUnder the UN guiding principles on business and human rights, companies are expected to undertake periodic due diligence to identify concerns and adjust their conduct, particularly during armed conflicts. MBDA’s owncode of ethicspoints to these responsibilities, stating the company is “committed to taking the utmost care in identifying and preventing negative direct and indirect impacts our activities may have on human rights, fundamental freedoms and people health and safety”.In its response to the Guardian, the company declined to say whether it had considered divesting its US operations or ceasing the supply of components for equipment sold to Israel. It added: “Activities that could involve the company in unlawful practices are prohibited.”BAE Systems andAirbussaid they had nothing to add to MBDA’s response. Leonardo said it has “has always acted in full compliance with national and international regulations regarding the export of military equipment”. Boeing referred inquiries to the US government.

I’d like to thank all of those in authority at Coca-Cola,” Trump said in asocial media postlate Tuesday.“This will be a very good move by them – You’ll see. It’s just better!”Initially, the drinks giant responded with a neutral statement of appreciation for “President Trump’s enthusiasm” for Coke, and a vague message about “new innovative offerings within ourCoca-Colaproduct range” to come.On Thursday, however, the soft drinks company released an additional statement making positive claims about high-fructose corn syrup, a product that some blame for soaring US obesity rates and which has become a target of health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr’s “Make America healthy again” movement.“The name sounds complex, but high fructose corn syrup (HFCS) – which we use to sweeten some of our beverages – is actually just a sweetener made from corn,” Coca-Cola said in a statement. “It’s safe; it has about the same number of calories per serving as table sugar and is metabolized in a similar way by your body.”It added that the American Medical Association “has confirmed that HFCS is no more likely to contribute to obesity than table sugar or other full-calorie sweeteners”, and said: “Please be assured that Coca-Cola brand soft drinks do not contain any harmful substances.”In 2023,the AMA released a statementsaying it recognized “that at the present time, insufficient evidence exists to specifically restrict use of high fructose corn syrup (HFCS) or other fructose-containing sweeteners in the food supply or to require the use of warning labels on products containing HFCS”.Trump’s rather abrupt entry into the Coca-Cola sugar debate comes as he struggles to move past a growing controversy over the release of files relating to the disgraced sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, a one-time friend of Trump’s.Trump’s effort to dismiss Epstein files as ‘hoax’ fails to quell Maga rebellionRead moreThe president’s high consumption of Diet Coke is well-documented, including the installation of a red “Diet Coke button” near his desk that he can press in order to summon a staff member with the drink.Diet Coke contains neither corn syrup nor sugar cane, but aspartame, a low-calorie artificial sweetener.A switch by Coca-Cola to using sugar cane could trade implications for the $285bn US soft drinks market. Coca-Cola in Mexico is made with cane sugar and packaged in glass bottles. Some is imported into the US, where it sells unofficially as “Mexican Coke” at a premium over its domestic counterpart.In the 1980s Coca-Cola’s US arm changed its formulation to use high-fructose corn syrup, supported by US farming subsidies, and not imported sugar cane subjected to import tariffs. But turning back the clock could prove costly if Trump’s high US tariffs on nations that produce sugar cane continue to apply.Trump had previously clashed with the company over voting access in Georgia, where the company is based. But ahead of his second inauguration as president in January of this year, the company’s CEO, James Quincey, presented Trump with an inaugural Diet Coke bottle.Explore more on these topicsUS newsCoca-ColaDonald TrumpHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

In Los Angeles, restaurants and food trucks have been forced to close as the immigrants who cook and wait tables fear Ice and other law enforcement.“Farm workers in many states are thinking about leaving the country because they are facing more obstacles to work under this anti-immigrant administration,” said Elizabeth Rodriguez, director of farm worker advocacy with National Farm Worker Ministry, a longstanding organization in south Texas.“They are scared, there are fewer opportunities, and they are no longer prospering here. Their fear will soon be seen in the harvest, when the quantities of produce are depleted.”graphs show that immigrants make up 27% of agricultural workers nationwide. In some states it’s even higher: in California, foreign-born workers are nearly two-thirds of the agricultural workforce. And in Florida, they make up more than half of crop production workers.From farm to table, at least one in five jobs in the food industry is carried out by immigrants, the equivalent of 14 million workers across the sector. This includes 27% of agricultural workers nationwide and 33% of meatpackers.In restaurants, 46%of chefs and 31% of cooks were born outside the US – mostly in Mexico, China, Guatemala and El Salvador.These jobs are critical: immigrants made up a disproportionate number of“essential”workers during the Covid-19 pandemic, and many were exposed to unsafe conditions so that crops could be harvested, cows milked and takeout delivered.“Whether it’s the workers behind the scenes in meatpacking plants or on the frontlines of the grocery store, our country relies heavily on the labor of immigrants to keep our food system running and our families fed,” said Mark Lauritsen, international vice-president at UnitedFoodand Commercial Workers International Union.“Without a stable, skilled workforce, safety and quality can decline, shelves can sit empty and grocery prices could rise even more.”graphs show immigrants comprise 33% of meat processing workers. In Nebraska, they make up 58% of those workers. More than one-fifth of all truck transportation workers are immigrants. There are 462,000 migrants working in grocery stores, or 15% of the workforce. They also make up more than one-third of the workforce in commercial bakeries.Yet food industry jobs, from fields to slaughterhouses and supermarkets to delivery drivers, are notoriously difficult and often low-paid: sometimes as little as $7.25 per hour, the federal minimum wage. Farmhands are often paid only a few dollars per box of tomatoes or cabbages harvested - backbreaking work with no shade.American food companies rely on undocumentedpeople for almost halfof the most physical jobs, including the farm laborers who cultivate crops, tend livestock and build fences, as well as the meat processors who slaughter, eviscerate and package at high speeds.Most Americans understand this. In the run-up to last year’s election, 75% of registered voterstold Pew Researchthat they believed undocumented immigrants mostly fill jobs US citizens don’t want to do.And now, with Ice raids and mass deportations, these jobs have become even more dangerous. At least one farm worker,Jaime Alanís, a 57-year-old Mexican man, hasdied after falling from a greenhouse trying to escape armed Ice agentsduring a raid in southern California last week. In response to these terrifying Ice raids which are spreading and becoming more violent, some farm workers in California are planning a strike in coming weeks and will be calling on consumers to boycott produce.“It is appalling to see the threat of violence and deportation that immigrant workers face every day. These people play a crucial role in restaurants, and more importantly in the community,” said Elyanna Calle, a restaurant worker in Austin, Texas, and president of Restaurant Workers United.“A raid, a deportation means the destruction of a life someone has fought to build; it means the destruction of families and vibrant communities. I have seen my co-workers fear for their safety, I have seen them go into fight or flight mode at the prospect of an Ice raid – this is not something that any person, any immigrant deserves.”Graphs show that according to the National Restaurant Association, 4m immigrants work in the industry, including 31% of cooks, 18% of waitstaff and more than 17% of food preparation and counter workers.If the Trump administration oversees even a fraction of its promised mass deportation of 11 million undocumented immigrants, it could lead to major disruptions across the food system: crops left to spoil in the fields, supermarket shelves unstocked, takeout deliveries delayed and food prices soaring even higher. It could also upend rural economies that depend on migrant workers and their families who live, work and go to school in small declining communities.“All of this will have a huge impact on the rest of us because the immigrant community contributes much more than their labor; they pay taxes,” said Rodriguez. “They invest in the economy, and if they make less money, we all make less, and when corporations make less, they increase prices so we lose again.”Data for this piece, unless otherwise noted, come from the Migration Policy InstituteExplore more on these topicsUS immigrationOur unequal earthFarmingFood & drink industryAgricultureRestaurantsFoodfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In December a ship carrying Russian oilwas seizedafter it severed cables between Finland and Estonia.Incidents around Taiwan over the past 18 months include aChinese-crewed freighter cutting cablesbetween the island and its outlying Penghu Islands in February by repeatedly manoeuvring in a zigzag pattern over the cables. The previous month, a Chinese-owned cargo ship was cited as the likely cause ofdamage to a Taiwan-US cable.The report said: “While it is difficult to definitively attribute recent incidents in the Baltic Sea and around Taiwan to state-sponsored sabotage, such operations align with both Russia and China’s strategic objectives, recently observed activities, and current deep-sea capabilities.”Recorded Future said a successful attack on multiple cables – which would cause prolonged disruption – would have to occur in deeper waters and would “very likely involve state-sponsored threat actors, due to the difficulty of accessing these sites”. Such an operation would probably take place before outright conflict, the report said.Recorded Future identified 44 cable damages over the past 18 months, a quarter caused by “anchor dragging” and nearly a third by “unknown causes”, with seismic activity or natural phenomena causing 16% of the incidents.View image in fullscreenAn undersea cable being laid in the Baltic Sea. Analysts say targeting these cables can be an attractive tactic because the damage can be passed off as an accident.Photograph: Lehtikuva/ReutersAnalysts added that damaging subsea cables could be an attractive tactic because it allowed states to target adversaries’ infrastructure via an unsophisticated method that could be passed off as an accident or be carried out by vessels without direct links to the attacks’ suspected sponsor.Recorded Future said improved monitoring of cables and security measures around subsea infrastructure, as well as comprehensive stress tests, would help prevent an incident damaging multiple cables and causing “prolonged connectivity issues”.Despite the high-profile Baltic and Taiwan incidents, the three most disruptive incidents were elsewhere: in the Red Sea in February last year when a Houthi missile caused a ship’s anchor to hit cables – leading to “significant impact on communication networks in the Middle East”; in west Africa a month later due to an underwater rock slide; and off the coast of South Africa in May 2024 due to a cable-dragging incident.Recorded Future said the impact of the Red Sea and Africa incidents showed that the most prolonged disruption happened in areas with limited availability of alternative cables and a shortage of repair expertise regardless of the cause of the disruption.Conversely, two attacks in the Baltic Sea in November last year had minimal impact due to spare capacity and Europe’s resilient internet infrastructure. However, the report said three EU island member states – Malta, Cyprus and Ireland – were more vulnerable due to their reliance on submarine cables for international communications.The UK government’s recent strategic defence review acknowledged the potential threat to the country’s subsea cabling and recommended that the Royal Navy takes a “new leading and coordinating role in securing undersea pipelines, cables, and maritime traffic carrying the information, energy, and goods upon which national life depends”.Explore more on these topicsTelecomsRussiaChinaAsia PacificEuropeInternetTaiwannewsShareReuse this content"

Excessive waste was rampant in every part of the industry – from surplus samples, to manufacturing scraps, to retail stores with “a disheveled mountain of garments that nobody wanted”, she said. “I was like, ‘I just don’t want to be a part of it any more.’”Then Cohen, who had designed for brands including Banana Republic, Club Monaco and J Crew, had a chance encounter with a manufacturer that changed her course. Drishti Lifestyle, based in India, had a container full of leather scraps it didn’t want to discard. Together they experimented, and made some wallets and a handbag, all of which sold out. That was the very start of Cohen’s sustainable leather accessories company – and her mission to make a dent in the industry’s immense waste problem.Launched in November 2019, Hyer Goods sells bags, wallets and other accessories made entirely from deadstocks: leftover scraps that would otherwise end up in landfills. Specifically, it uses luxury leather leftovers, retrieved from designer heavyweights like Hermès, Chanel, and Valentino. Deadstocks are sourced both directly from Italian factories – such as a tannery in the outskirts of Naples, Russo di Casandrino – and via “people on the ground” in Italy who have longstanding relationships with those brands.View image in fullscreenDana Cohen, the owner and designer of Hyer Goods, in her store in Manhattan, New York.Photograph: Tobias Everke/The GuardianThe scraps are then transported to family-run factories in Italy’s Marche region, on the Adriatic coast: a mother-daughter-run factory produces the bags, and down the road, a father-son-run factory assembles the wallets. “We literally load the scraps from the bags in a little car and drive it to the wallet factory,” Cohen said.Designer brands typically only use the very highest grades of leather, so Hyer takes the “off-cuts” that are still above par, but may have blemishes like tick bites or stretch marks, and cuts around them.Given the reliance on whatever is available, the Hyer collection is inherently small-batch, and a single line of bags might comprise a mix of different leathers. “We have never made 500 pieces of anything,” Cohen said.The unpredictable supply can be hard. “It’s not for the faint of heart,” Cohen said. But she estimates this model has kept approximately 7,000 pounds of leather in circulation – and out of landfills – over the last six years of operation.It’s a start in healing an industry that sends about 92m tonnes of textiles to landfills every year, producing between 4% and 8% of the world’sgreenhouse gas emissions.“I appreciate any company that’s really trying to work towards the circular economy,” said Ann Cantrell, associate professor of fashion business management at New York’s Fashion Institute of Technology (FIT), “which is trying to keep things in the loop as long as we can and not go to landfill.” She said Hyer Goods’s model followed the“triple bottom line”: operating not only for profitability, but also for improving conditions for people and for the planet. If more businesses operate with such models, they can “continue to challenge the status quo” around issues like the overuse of virgin materials, she said.Leather is particularly troublesome for its connection to cattle ranching, which is linked to deforestation, mass water use and the emission of methane, a potent greenhouse gas. Tanning also uses toxic chemicals that can contaminate waterways. On the other hand, leather is an extremely durable product, sometimes lasting decades. “So from that perspective, it is a sustainable material,” said Cantrell.Sustainability is nuanced. “There’s no perfectly sustainable material,” said Elizabeth Cline, an author and expert on fast fashion and sustainability. But Cline said repurposing genuine leather is better than producing so-called vegan leather, or faux leather, which is made of plastics, even when it also contains some plant-based materials like cork or apple peels. “You’re eliminating the animal welfare issue, but creating new environmental problems,” she said.The reality is that high-end consumers are still buying genuine leather. While Hyer’s average customer is the sustainable-minded person looking for greener alternatives, Cohen said she is starting to see more luxury-driven customers.View image in fullscreenDana Cohen, the owner and designer of Hyer Goods together with her creative partner David Siskin, in front of her store in Manhattan, New York.Photograph: Tobias Everke/The GuardianHyer’s bestsellingRing Bag, made from lambskin Nappa, a premium leather known for its softness, typically sells for $465 – nothing to sneeze at but still a far cry from luxury brands that retail for several thousand dollars.Cohen launched Hyer Goods just months before the pandemic.People weren’t buying fancy handbags during lockdowns so she briefly pivoted to sewing masks with leftover fabrics – even curtains – that she crowdsourced on social media. Consulting followers for opinions has continued to be a strategy. “I think people really like being a part of the process,” she says. “Not only is it a great way to connect with community, but it’s a really good way to make smart decisions.”Soon, the bags gained the attention of influential figures like Katie Couric and the internet chef Alison Roman. When Romanrecommended the bagsto her followers: “That was one of the best days for us, ever,” Cohen said.Major brands like Bloomingdales, Nordstrom and Madewell now sell Hyer Goods bags, and in 2024, Cohen opened a brick-and-mortar store in New York’s West Village after winning a grant from the non-profitChaShaMa, which supports women and minority artists by providing them with subsidized real estate spaces.Beginning April, the Trump administration imposed 10%tariffson goods from Italy, leaving Cohen little choicebut to raise prices. The price bumps initially led to a “huge dip” in sales, she said. Volumes seem back to normal now, though that’s hard to parse out due to seasonal shifts. “I’m not sure if the customer has gotten used to it, but I certainly haven’t,” she said. (In July, Trump announcedadditional tariffson European goods, which European trade officials said would make continuing US-EU trade ““almost impossible”.)View image in fullscreenDana Cohen, the owner and designer of Hyer Goods, in her store in Manhattan, New York.Photograph: Tobias Everke/The GuardianCohen said she had no plans to move operations to the US; many factories that she had considered weren’t capable of details like edge painting (to protect leather edges from fraying), which would sacrifice quality. “The craftsmanship that you can get in Italy just doesn’t compare,” she said. “‘Made in USA was just not an option.”Cohen, who has five part-time employees, said she’d like to expand products into belts and shoes, start sourcing deadstock Italian cottons, and open a second store, perhaps in Brooklyn. She’d like to be fully circular, including hardware like zippers, which are not made from scraps.But economic volatility – and simply the nature of a bootstrapped business that depends on a fluctuating supply – have delayed some of those plans. “Any dreams I had, I’ve put on hold,” she said. “Right now it’s just: how can we stay afloat?”But nothing has changed her mission, which comes before any growth ambitions, she said. “My goal was never to be a behemoth organization,” Cohen said. “I just want to have a nice, small business for people who care.”Explore more on these topicsFashionThe New Face of Small BusinessFashion industryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The nine-time NBA All-Star is finalizing a three-year, $42m contract with the franchise where he spent the first 11 seasons of his career, ESPNreportedThursday. The deal includes a player option for the 2027–28 season and a no-trade clause.Lillard, who turned 35 this week, waswaived by the Milwaukee Buckson 7 July. The team stretched the $113m remaining on his contract to make room for free-agent center Myles Turner.The veteran guard is expected to miss the entire 2025–26 season after undergoing surgery in May to repair a torn left achilles tendon. He sustained the injury on 27 April in the first quarter of the Bucks’ Game 4 loss to Indiana in the first round of the Eastern Conference playoffs. It was just his third game back after missing a month due to a blood clot in his right calf. He also sat out the final 14 games of the regular season.Despite receiving interest from playoff contenders offering mid-level and veteran minimum deals, Lillard chose to return to Portland, where his family resides. Talks with general manager Joe Cronin and head coach Chauncey Billups intensified in recent weeks, with all sides aligned on a reunion. His agent, Aaron Goodwin, is finalizing the terms this week.View image in fullscreenDamian Lillard remains Portland’s all-time leader in points and threes and second in assists.Photograph: Alika Jenner/Getty ImagesBetween his stretched Milwaukee salary and the new Portland contract, Lillard will earn $70m next season and $141m over the next two years.Lillard initially requested a trade in 2023 after the Trail Blazers began a rebuild. He was dealt to Milwaukee in a three-team blockbuster that sent Jrue Holiday and Toumani Camara to Portland. Holiday was later traded to Boston, then reacquired by the Blazers this offseason.With Lillard’s return, the Blazers now boast a core that includes Holiday, Robert Williams III, Scoot Henderson, Camara and a stockpile of future picks and swaps.Lillard averaged 24.9 points, 7.1 assists, and 4.7 rebounds in 58 regular-season games with Milwaukee. He owns career averages of 25.1 points, 6.7 assists, and 4.3 rebounds over 900 games.He ranks fourth all-time in made three-pointers (2,804) and eighth among active players in scoring (22,598 points).

It just appeared as if nobody was minded to pay heed to them on a day when Rory McIlroy’s competitive return to Northern Ireland turned every head andScottie Schefflerperformed his usual trick of hiding in plain sight.McIlroy seemed to battle his game more than the elements for much of round one but emerged unscathed and under par. McIlroy lacks nothing in tenacity, a matter which is often overlooked. His 70 leaves him just three from the lead in what is a wonderfully congested major.Rory McIlroy flirts with 2019 Open nightmare but recovers to keep dream intactRead moreThe problem for all involved may well be that Scheffler is already only one adrift after a round where he ranked 150th in driving accuracy. “When it’s raining sideways, it’s actually, believe it or not, not that easy to get the ball in the fairway,” said Scheffler, needing only a saucer of milk. If Scheffler has finally cracked the Open code, it feels like a question of who will be second.Harris English arrived without his caddie, Eric Larson being denied travel from the US because of a drug conviction from three decades ago. English wandered into a bustling Portrush bar on Wednesday evening without so much as head turns from locals. Harris is 54 holes from becoming the first English man to win the Open since 1992.Christiaan Bezuidenhout swallowed rat poison as a two-year-old, an event which proved significant during the Amateur Championship at Royal Portrush in 2014. Bezuidenhout was using beta blockers to help with a stammer related to the childhood incident, triggering a failed doping test and a ban which was later reduced from two years to nine months.Sadom Kaewkanjana is seeking to become the first ordained monk to lift the Claret Jug. Kaewkanjana’s scenario led to a quite wonderful post-round media moment, as the Thai was asked whether he may consider dedicating himself to Buddhism at a later date. “My goal is to play in the Masters,” came the reply. Shove your meditation, give me Magnolia Lane.This was golf’s longest day. Rounds stretched to six hours, a preposterous if unavoidable situation with a 156-man field and penal rough. McIlroy’s group took four hours to play 11 holes. Keegan Bradley, the US Ryder Cup captain, recounted five groups playing or waiting to play the 7th at the same time. “It felt like we were on the golf course for about 12 hours,” said Marc Leishman. “We had been on the course for three hours through eight holes.” Grim.As darkness fell, five players topped the pack at four under. English and Bezuidenhout were joined by a resurgent Matt Fitzpatrick, Li Haotong and Jacob Skov Olesen. Denmark’s Olesen won as an amateur on the links of Ballyliffin. He played the back nine on Thursday in an outstanding 32. Kaewkanjana, Scheffler, Matthew Jordan and Tyrrell Hatton are one back. Hatton’s strong showing in last month’s US Open has clearly fuelled confidence. During such an attritional test, the occasionally combustible Englishman kept his head.View image in fullscreenChristiaan Bezuidenhout shares the lead and will be hoping to banish bad memories of the 2014 Amateur Championship.Photograph: Peter Byrne/PAThe morning starters endured squally, brutal conditions at times. A predicted afternoon storm bypassed this corner of the Causeway Coast. When McIlroy took to the opening tee, shortly after 3pm, the picture was one of serenity. It was therefore surprising that the four under par posted by Olesen, Li and Fitzpatrick – later matched by Bezuidenhout – was not headed until English made a birdie on the 12th. English promptly handed a shot back to the course on 14. Menacing pin positions played a key role in keeping scoring higher than would otherwise have been the case.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Lee Westwood, an avid Portrush fan, rolled back the years and rolled in the putts when reaching minus four inside 12 holes. Westwood played his closing stretch in plus two but was still rightly content with his 69. Rickie Fowler matched that score as did Nicolai Højgaard, who only qualified for the Open on Sunday. The fields of Aaron Rai? The Wolverhampton man joined the 69 club having been four under by the 9th tee. Justin Rose delivered two under shortly before 9pm. English closed out his round half an hour later.There were moments of chaos. Tommy Fleetwood’s ball finished in foot marks in a bunker on the 5th, calling into question the Royal & Ancient’s new policy of having caddies clean up after their players. Previous Opens had dedicated bunker rakers. Bryson DeChambeau whiffed a shot when knee high in rough at the 4th. One for the Californian’s YouTube channel, surely. DeChambeau’s day at the office added up to 78 blows and his worst opening round at a major.Wyndham Clark slumped to a 76 the day after it was confirmed he has been banned from Oakmont Country Club for physically abusing lockers. The R&A might need to order some reinforced wood. Other notables to struggle included Patrick Reed, who shot 77, Brooks Koepka and Collin Morikawa. The latter pair signed for 75s.

After the first summit finish of 2025, the defending champion’s next overall victory now appears an inevitability. Pogacar beat his rival to the ski station finish by well over two minutes and now leads the Tour by more than three and half minutes, with nine stages remaining.Pas de suspense, the French would say, and after the Slovenian’s eighth career stage win in the Pyrenees, Vingegaard is scrambling to sustain a meaningful challenge. If Pogacar had been scared when crashing in Toulouse, 24 hours earlier, he showed no ill effects as he dealt a lethal blow to Vingegaard’s aspirations under a fierce Pyrenean sun.Tour de France 2025: Pogacar blows field away on stage 12 summit finish in Pyrenees – liveRead more“I feel at the best moment of my career,” he said. “I’m riding in the rainbow jersey, I ride with an amazing team, so it’s like a fairytale for me. I think once this fire goes out, I will probably decline in performance but I’d say that now is the peak of my career, and I’ll try to hold it for as long as I can.”He did admit to being anxious prior to the stage however. “I was nervous at the start, a little bit cranky maybe,” Pogacar said. “There was the role of 2022, when I lost the Tour here [at Hautacam]. I lost it that day and I guess I was really motivated.”Burned by Pogacar, Vingegaard is looking over his shoulder at those hot on his heels, including the Scottish climber Oscar Onley, who was fifth at Hautacam and is sustaining his challenge in sixth overall. The Dane has lost time to his Slovenian rival in the long time trial and in the Tour’s first summit finish. From here, it appears unlikely that he will be able to mount a challenge for the yellow jersey.There was more than a little questioning of his Visma-Lease a Bike team’s tactics, after Vingegaard arrived at the foot of the final climb alone and surrounded by UAE Emirates riders. Long gone was Matteo Jorgenson, who had started the stage fifth overall but fell back on the Col du Soulor. Nor was there any sign of Simon Yates, winner on Puy de Sancy, but now unable to help his leader.Pogacar’s decisive move came at the foot of the 13km ascent after he was set up by his Ecuadorian teammate Jhonatan Narváez. Initially, Vingegaard kept the defending champion in sight, the gap hovering at a handful of seconds, but as the pursuit wore on, Pogacar cruised clear. Emmanuel Macron briefly joined Christian ­Prudhomme in the race director’s car and the French ­president was treated to a ringside seat as Pogacar powered up the slopes.Further down the mountain, Ben Healy was toiling up the climb, eventually losing the best part of 14 minutes to the Slovenian. In furnace conditions, Healy’s overall leadership had wilted on the exposed climb of the Col du Soulor, where Remco Evenepoel also suffered and lost ground.The morning after Pogacar’s crash on the approach to Toulouse, the polemics over the peloton’s decision to wait for the Slovenian continued. In the end, however, it was an irrelevance. The show of sportsmanship from Healy and Vingegaard was not lost on Demi Vollering, whose crash while leading the 2024 Tour de France Femmes, after which the peloton did not look back, effectively cost her the race. “So kind of the bunch not to use this crash ofTadej Pogacarto take time on him,” she posted on Instagram. “Guess men are a bit more kind.”It also was a mournful convoy that entered the Pyrenees, the morning after a promising talent had been lost to a high-speed crash, following the death of young Italian Samuele ­Privitera, who was killed on Wednesday while racing in the Giro delle Valle d’Aosta.According to reports in the Italian media, the 19-year-old crashed as the peloton was riding downhill at 70kph. He is understood to have fallen and hit the iron gate of a house, losing his helmet during the impact and suffering a cardiac arrest. Thursday’s second stage of the Giro delle Valle d’Aosta was cancelled.The Italian was riding for the Hagens Berman Jayco development team, a feeder outfit for Jayco AlUla, currently riding in the Tour. In tribute, there was a minute’s applause at the start of stage 12 in Auch. Axel Merckx, son of Eddy and manager of the Hagens Berman team, said that the rider’s loss was “devastating beyond words.”Friday’s stage 13 time trial, from Loudenvielle to Peyragudes is unlikely to change the current narrative, although Evenepoel will be keen to bounce back and exploit any further weakness on the part of Vingegaard. Pogacar however, is expected to increase his overall lead.Explore more on these topicsTour de France 2025Tour de FranceCyclingTadej PogacarnewsShareReuse this content"

He is survived by his two daughters, Blakely and Marlowe, aged 11 and eight.He once describedhis seven NFL seasons, his Super Bowl win and his daughters as “the three greatest accomplishments in my life”.According to a GoFundMe page set up to help Braman with his medical expenses, he was diagnosed with cancer in February. The page had raised $88,000 and many of his former teammates had given donations, including JJ Watt, who contributed $10,000. QualifiedNFLplayers are eligible for health insurance for five years after they retire. Braman’s final season came in 2017, with the Super Bowl his last ever professional game.“Bryan, people saw this enormous human being, but his heart was big as his body,” Stellatotold Houston’s KPRC 2on Thursday. “His spirit was so motivating. He was so real and genuine with everybody. That made him special.“It’s hard. I feel like I lost my firstborn. This kid, he gave me his bed every time I came to Philadelphia. He would threaten me if I didn’t stay with him. That’s something I’ll always cherish. My heart hurts today.”The 6ft 5in, 230lb Braman joined the Texans in 2011 as an undrafted free agent after stints with Long Beach City College, Idaho and West Texas A&M in college. He soon established himself on special teams thanks to his fearless play –he once made a tackle despite losing his helmet– and was known for his punt blocking ability.One of Braman’s most memorable moments came during the Eagles’ Super Bowl run, not just for a highlight play, but for the way he rebounded from a costly mistake. In the second quarter of the divisional-round win over the Falcons, Braman dove to touch a live punted ball, a blunder that gave Atlanta a short field and led to their only touchdown of the game.He didn’t have to wait long for redemption. On the very next Falcons punt, Braman surged through the line and tipped the ball, forcing a 22-yard shank. Although he was initially flagged for running into the kicker, he immediately told officials he had made contact with the ball – a claim confirmed by replay, which wiped out the penalty.“It was big for me,” he said after the game. “I was able to keep my head in the game and turn it around.” The Eagles turned the short field into a 53-yard field goal by Jake Elliott, trimming the deficit to 10–9 just before half-time and swinging momentum in a game they would go on to win 15–10.For Braman, it was a fitting example of his mentality: fearless, resilient and team-first. “I just had to let it go and do my job,” he said. “If I let it affect me, then I start reaching. That’s when other bad things start to happen.”He recorded one tackle in the Super Bowl itself as the Eagles beat the New England Patriots 41-33 to win their first NFL championship since the 1960 season.Explore more on these topicsNFLPhiladelphia EaglesHouston TexansUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

England reached a sixth consecutive major tournament semi-final with a gut-busting performance to come from two goals down against Sweden before sealing victory via a penalty shootout with goalkeeper Hannah Hampton the hero.Kosovare Asllani’s early strike and Stina Blackstenius’s effort had rattled Sarina Wiegman’s side. It had been all Sweden, England were down and out, headed for the Euros exit, their crown relinquished, but you can never bet against Wiegman in a major tournament and, although many were screaming for changes to come sooner, it was her late cavalry that delivered two goals in 102 seconds to level the score and force the game beyond 90 minutes. England became the first team to come from two goals down in the knockout stages of the women’s Euros since the tournament began in 1984 and Hampton was the superstar, emerging from Mary Earps’ shadow, saving two spot-kicks with Sweden missing three others.Asllani had promised that Sweden had the “perfect gameplan” for facing the team with whom they share many similar characteristics. The first blow was dealt in the second minute and the target of Sweden’s gameplan was clear: attack England’s new look left-hand side. Jess Carter had struggled at left-back against France and was swapped with the left-sided centre-back Alex Greenwood for their remaining two group games. The move had seemed effective but it was compromised by the Swedes.View image in fullscreenHannah Hampton (right) is congratulated by Esme Morgan after the goalkeeper saved two penalties in the shootout.Photograph: Nick Potts/PAUnder pressure, Carter’s pass to Keira Walsh fell short and was intercepted, the second time she had turned over the ball within a minute, and it fell kindly for Blackstenius who squared to Asllani and the midfielder fired low past Hampton into the bottom corner.The yellow wall of fans behind Jennifer Falk’s goal roared while those in white seemed shell-shocked, England’s sloppiness and inability to escape Sweden’s press so untypical of the team that had dispatched the Netherlands and Wales so easily.Carter was exposed again soon after, a loose pass to Hampton pickpocketed by Blackstenius but Leah Williamson raced back to block her club teammate’s effort.Kosovare AsllaniEngland almost had an equaliser against the run of play a minute later, Lauren Hemp denied when Falk tipped her shot on to the crossbar, but any hopes a first effort on goal would calm England were in vain. Wiegman’s side were overrun, outmuscled, outfought and outthought and Sweden’s second seemed inevitable. It arrived in the 25th minute, Blackstenius racing clear of a ponderous Carter before firing low into the far corner. It was too easy, and in an attempt to halt the success of Sweden on their right, Williamson and Carter switched sides.Hampton ensured the deficit remained at two with a big save to deny Fridolina Rolfö shortly before the break and England raced down the tunnel to pick over the bones of an utterly humiliating first half.View image in fullscreenMichelle Agyemang scores England’s second goal to turn the tie on its head.Photograph: Matthew Childs/ReutersThere was surprise that there were no changes at the break for England, the determination to continue with a clearly struggling Carter was baffling, particularly when the far more agile Manchester United captain Maya Le Tissier, Washington Spirit’s Esme Morgan and the Arsenal centre-back Lotte Wubben-Moy were on the bench. You could argue that Carter improved, but the reality is that Sweden took their foot off the gas, their press loosened as they allowed England more time on the ball.The defending champions were better after the restart. Ella Toone forced a save from Falk before Hemp flashed a header wide, but they just could not get the ball down the right. Bronze had her arms raised for much of the first half and cut an isolated figure on that flank, despite many having identified the left-back Jonna Andersson as the weak link for the Swedes in the buildup.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Michelle Agyemang, Beth Mead and Morgan would be tasked with rescuing England, Toone and Stanway replaced along with Carter.It was chaos from them on until the close, the kitchen sink thrown in by Wiegman, with the entire midfield eventually removed as they fought to get into the game and then go for the win.Wiegman’s charges prodded at the Sweden defence and they finally pierced it in the 79th minute, Bronze drifting past everyone at the far post to meet substitute Chloe Kelly’s cross and head past Falk. It was a lifeline and there was less than two minutes between Bronze’s goal and the equaliser, Kelly’s cross nodded down by Mead and turned in by Agyemang. They should have grabbed the winner, Alessia Russo taking one touch too many after she had just the keeper to beat in virtually the last serious attack before extra time.If England had the marginally fresher legs on the pitch, it did not show in extra time, the game far more even than Wiegman would have liked. There were some issues too, Williamson rolled her ankle forcing her to limp off at the midway point of extra time, James also felt the full force of a Lina Hurtig challenge and a three-way clash between Greenwood, Hampton and a Swede left the keeper with a nosebleed and the former with her shoulder being repositioned while Bronze taped her own thigh up.There was not much more action and a shootout was confirmed soon after. Julia Zigiotti Olme and Nathalie Björn scored for Sweden but Russo, Kelly and Bronze converted for England and Hampton saved from Filippa Angeldahl and Sofia Jakobsson while Magda Eriksson hit the post. Smilla Holmberg and Falk, who had saved from James, Clinton and Greenwood efforts, fired over, to send England through in the most dramatic of fashions.

Sharing stories brings us together and gives us strength.”The Switzerland defender Noelle Maritz said watching the footage had given her goosebumps. Sundhage did not dwell on the fact that Spain went on to win the 2010 World Cup while Switzerland were knocked out in the group stage, focusing on the here and now and describing the game as the biggest of her career.The 65-year-old, who won Euro 84 as a player with Sweden and triumphed at two Olympics when in charge of the United States, said: “It is the biggest game ever [for me].

Aitana Bonmatí’s fifth-minute opener was quickly cancelled out by a freakish Laia Codina own goal from near the centre circle. Alba Redondo restored their lead, Bonmatí struck again and Codina made amends for her error. Jennifer Hermoso then added a fifth, showing Spain’s strength in depth. “We proved we are a team of 23 players,” said Spain’s coach, Jorge Vilda.Spain 5-0 Switzerland, 26 September 2023, CordobaThe world champions were greeted by a record 14,914 fans for their homecoming match at the ​​Nuevo Arcángel stadium. Before kick-off both teams held up a banner reading “Se Acabó (it’s over) Our fight is the global fight” in reference to Spanish football federation president Luis Rubiales’s resignation for forcibly kissing Hermoso on the lips. On the pitch, it was a routine Nations League group win for Spain with Lucía García, Bonmatí (twice), Inma Gabarro and Maite Oroz on the scoresheet.Switzerland 1-7 Spain, 31 October 2023, ZurichSwitzerland suffered their third heavy defeat in as many months to La Roja at Stadion Letzigrund, though this time they managed a consolation from Alayah Pilgrim when trailing 4-0, courtesy of goals from Oihane Hernández, Alexia Putellas (with two) and María Méndez. The substitutes Athenea del Castillo (two) and Oroz added three more to cap off another Nations League thrashing.Ervin AngWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.“The support we have had is impossible do describe,” the Aston Villa defender Maritz said. “We all thought that there would be a good atmosphere at a home tournament … but on this scale? It gives you a lot of energy when you see the fans marching towards the stadium. You saw it at the Finland game – and to be able to share that success with the fans was really something.”Sundhage’s side have improved substantially since the 2-1 loss to Norway, with the midfielder Géraldine Reuteler in outstanding form and the 18-year-old Barcelona forward Sydney Schertenleib coming in to give the attack a new dimension.And now there is real belief. Sundhage said they “will need a bit of luck” to beat Spain but that they could force that luck with the way they play. Maritz was more bullish, saying they would stick to their gameplan and “walk off as winners”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We have a super team spirit and have been able to take a lot of positive energy from the past two games. We have a good feeling about this game.”The Spain defender Irene Paredes said the world champions would have to be calm in the face of the home support. “We need to be patient,” she said. “They will have the crowd behind them, so they will come out very strong.“They’re a team who know exactly what they’re about. They defend in great numbers and also get a lot of their players into the box to attack. They have very direct players and their midfielders love to keep the ball.

Although Newcastle have repeatedly reiterated that they are determined to keep their prized centre-forward, and the Anfield board are in advanced negotiations tosign the Eintracht Frankfurt forward Hugo Ekitike, Isak’s thoughts on the future remain unknown.Howe’s dilemma as Newcastle’s Saudi owners can’t ignore case to sell IsakRead more“There’s always going to be noise around a player of Alex’s stature,” said Elanga as, relaxing after a ­morning training session at Newcastle’s camp in Austria, he spoke publicly for the first time since joining from ­Nottingham Forest. “But he’s always staying super-focused. He’s one of the best attackers in the world but he’s aNewcastle Unitedplayer right now.”When, earlier this week, Newcastle made a bid for Ekitike speculation intensified that Isak could be heading for the St James’ Park exit, but the club maintained Howe’s plan was to play the Swede alongside the France Under-21 international. Now the club are exploring, among other options, a potential attempt to recruit Brentford’s Yoane Wissa to alternate between partnering and understudying Isak.Yet with Tottenham also keen on Wissa and some members of Newcastle’s hierarchy concerned that, at 28, the Democratic Republic of the Congo striker would have limited resale value, any transfer is some way from completion.Isak is contracted to Newcastle until 2028 and has, so far, indicated no great enthusiasm for an extended deal, which makes it seem likely he will seek a move next summer at the latest.“Whenever I speak to Alex it’s always about good things,” said Elanga, diplomatically. “About how my family is and how his family is. I always try and focus on the present. But that mentality Alex has shown in training is second to none and I’m looking forward to continuing to train with him.“For me, he’s the best striker in the world and an amazing person as well that I can always rely on to go for advice. He’s always there to help me. I appreciate him a lot.“Alex being here is amazing, so, of course, he played a part in me joining Newcastle but so did having Sandro [Tonali], Bruno [Guimarães], Joelinton and Anthony Gordon. They all played a huge part in me coming here. They have that winning mentality.”Elanga believes “anything is possible” as the Carabao Cup holders prepare for a Champions League campaign. “I want to showcase my talent,” the 23-year-old said. “I’m pacey and direct. I can play on either side, I can play as a striker. I can use both feet. I’ve got lots of weapons.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

What we want to achieve, how we want to play, it’s perfect. What we’re building here is unique and special.

In my life, I’ve never rushed anything. The staff and players here, they all share similar mentalities.”Elanga believes this collective mindset will result in silverware next spring. “With the players and staff here and the addition of Martin Mark from Midtjylland as set-piece coach, we’re really on the right track. I can really sense that feeling of we really want to grab something and win something. Anything’s possible.”Explore more on these topicsNewcastle UnitedTransfer windownewsShareReuse this content"

The offer is worth up to £70m, with £65m guaranteed and the rest add-ons.Ruben Amorim is eager to sign Mbeumo, who has indicated to Brentford he would like to join United, but Sir Jim Ratcliffe is eager not to pay over the odds.

They fly to the United States for a tour next week and Amorim wants Mbeumo as part of the squad that travels, to give the Cameroon international as much time as possible to integrate.United also hold an interest in Chelsea’s Nicolas Jackson as they seek a central forward. Five players who will not be part of the tour are Marcus Rashford, Alejandro Garnacho, Antony, Jadon Sancho and Tyrell Malacia, whowant to leaveand are not part of team training.

Multi-storey car parks have been causing spikes in blood pressure ever since City & Suburban Electric Carriage Company opened the first anxiety maze at 6 Denman Street, London,in May 1901. Multiplexes are for watching films that have been dubbed over by some gobby ne’er-do-well crunching on a never-ending bucket of popcorn. Multiperspectivalism looks an interesting concept, sure, but we’re too thick to understand it properly and now we’ve got a headache. And the multiverse? This one not causing you enough misery?Even this multipronged intro has outstayed its welcome. We could have just said that all connected with Crystal Palace are seeing the downside of football’s increasingly popular multi-club model. Last week, Palace were demoted from Bigger Vase to Tin Pot because Lyon – who are owned by Eagle Football Holdings, the company of Palace’s main shareholder John Textor, although he is in the process of selling his shares and we’re boring ourselves now – are in the same competition. Lyon finished higher in their domestic league, which means Palace are currently wearing a Tin Pot parachute against their will.Their Bigger Vase place is likely to be taken by Nottingham Forest, whose benevolent concern for the greater good of football motivated them to inform Uefa of a potential breach of regulations by Palace. Forest’s owner Evangelos Marinakis also owns Olympiakos, but that’s different because … look, justclick this for all the grown-up stuff. When Football Daily stumbled upon a video interview with Palace’s chairman Steve Parish and saw the quote “one of the great injustices”, our first thought was to wonder why Alan Bates had changed his appearance so drastically. Parish has appealed to Cas – and The Rest is Football, and anyone else who fancies an interview – so this is likely to go on for a while yet.For a neutral teatime email there’s particular sadness in seeing Palace finish last in the Uefa Multi-Club Loophole Stakes. When they beat Manchester City in the FA Cup final in May, one word was conspicuous by its absence from the immediate post-match analysis: Europe. All that mattered was that Palace had won their first major trophy at the tender age of 119, and gloriously to boot. A Bigger Vase spot was the reward, not the prize. We have sympathy, not least because a Uefa sermon on integrity is almost as hilarious as Bob Mortimer on Would I Lie To You? But this has been on the cards for one club or another since multi-club ownership became English football’s latest money-spinne – sorry, English football’s first opportunity to pioneer and deliver a consistent underlying approach to talent development, fan experiences, sports entertainment, commercial opportunities and community impact. Still, Palace v Forest on 24 August should be fun. No, you silly old romantic, not the football. We want cameras in the boardroom. These days, that’s where the real action is.LIVE ON BIG WEBSITEJoin Sarah Rendell from 8pm BST for MBM coverage of Sweden 2-1 England (aet) in the Euro 2025 quarter-finals.QUOTE OF THE DAY“It’s soul-destroying.

The loudspeaker quietened in respect. The few dozen people at the ground braved the summer swelter to crowd near the players’ tunnels. Ghanaian players walked out in no noticeable combination with slightly puzzled looks on their faces. The noise grew louder and more distinctive as one voice called and the others responded. There was definitely the beating of a drum.Then, they emerged. Defending champions SouthAfricaannounced their arrival at the Women’s Africa Cup of Nations (Wafcon) with nothing but notes of pure joy. For about 90 seconds, they kept the tune going. Even before they had kicked a ball, Banyana Banyana had offered something special.How Poland’s Euro 2025 showing transformed a nation’s view of women’s footballRead moreThis is a team who, as coach Desiree Ellis put it, “through all the challenges, consistently rise to the occasion,” and the challenges are plenty. Despite winning the last Wafcon, the Glasgow City winger Linda Motlhalo told Moving the Goalposts that, “not a lot has changed, especially in terms of investing in women’s football”.The South African domestic league is still not professional, the national team are still in arguments with the South African Football Federation (SAFA) over unpaid match fees. They are still asking for better facilities and logistics and still desperate for a sponsor (even more so now that longstanding backer Sasol has yet to renew its 16-year agreement). The buildup to this Wafcon was as chaotic as ever with players boycotting a training session to demand the money owed to them, and complained about small, shared hotel rooms and being expected to play in scorching temperatures in a north African (and southern European) heatwave at the base in Oujda, 15km from the Algerian border and the hottest of the host venues.The chief executive of Safa, Lydia Monyepao, said the weekend before the tournament began that “the disagreement arose because of the payment dates. However, we have since addressed that matter. But it must be clear that this is not to do with the bonuses for Wafcon. This is about match fees for friendly matches.” When approached by Moving the Goalposts the governing body said it would make no further comments on the issue.As Motlhalo put it, 10 days into the event, not a lot has changed except that all 12 teams have got on with things amid some grumpiness. A general lack of interest in Morocco, apart from matches involving the hosts, has raised concerns about the seriousness with which women’s football is regarded. So too, has the fact that the games are being played at second-tier stadiums as the main ones are renovated for the men’s Afcon and the 2030 World Cup. Is this Wafcon an afterthought? Given that it was supposed to take place a year ago and another will kick off in nine months’ time, it could be that is how it is regarded for everyone but those involved, who are making what they can of this opportunity.View image in fullscreenEmpty seats as the Mali team are introduced at the Stade d’Honneur in Oujda.Photograph: Shengolpixs/AlamyTake Ghana, a country that last qualified for the knockouts nine years ago and who are now unveiling a new generation of players. Their Swedish head coach, Kim Björkegren, has said the Black Queens are more talented than his own compatriots but lacking the Scandinavian attention to minor detail which could elevate them to the next level. “Ghana has so much talent. It’s something in the DNA,” he said. “If you can add 5% of the Swedish organisation, we’re going to have a team that is good, not just in Africa, but in the world.”Or take the Senegalese striker Nguenar Ndiaye, who plays at French third-division club Bourges Foot 18, and is the joint leading goalscorer after the group stage. Ndiaye, like so many women at this tournament, started off playing with and against boys to the disapproval of her parents and has since had to climb every rung on the ladder to a contract with an overseas club. She embodies the resilience that it takes to succeed and her advice to young hopefuls from a Confederation of African Football interview a few years back has the same relevance today. “Playing football is really difficult, but it’s also very rewarding,” she said. “It’s very holy, and it doesn’t prevent you from living your life as a woman of your time.”Ultimately, that is the discussion we still need to have at the Wafcon: how to balance conversations around pure football with the broader social issues facing African female athletes. While the captains at Euro 2025 are wearing the rainbow armband to support LGBTQI+ rights, homosexuality is illegal in 10 of the 12 participating Wafcon nations. While the European players are talking tactics and strategies, the Africans are doing that while looking for ways to get paid. While women’s football in Europe grows exponentially – Uefa’s most recent report records a five-time increase in the last 20 years and over 1.2 million registered players – CAF’s promotional video for this tournament is a call to action to encourage young girls to play.View image in fullscreenPlenty of seats free to watch the Morocco v Senegal game in a cafe in Saidia.Photograph: Firdose MoondaIndeed, while there are big groups of young boys in Moroccan football shirts kicking a ball about late into the night, the girls are absent. In the coastal town of Saidia, one hour away from the host city of Oujda, in a cafe set up to broadcast the Morocco-Senegal game, a young girl in a football jersey walked in with her family in the first encouraging sign that there is interest among the targeted demographic. However, she ordered an ice-cream and ate it with her back turned to the screens as Morocco won 1-0.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

South Africa do not plan these chants. They sing in the bus and in the tunnel before every game, entirely spontaneously. The squad has a repertoire of traditional songs to hand, they don’t know any of the names and on any given day, one of them starts and the rest join in. It’s an instinctive expression of identity and cannot be explained any better than that. It’s only fitting that they are doing it with such gusto here.Morocco is a country of music, often performed informally and almost always loudly. On the weekend of the Wafcon final, Oujda will host a raï music festival, celebrating a genre that originates in western Algeria, is rooted in Bedouin traditions and often sung by women.

Day one at the Open marked McIlroy’s first competitive appearance in Northern Ireland since he became just the sixth golfer in history to complete a career grand slam, at the Masters in April. He was backed by packed and vociferous galleries throughout.McIlroy’s round contrasted sharply with his start in 2019 as the Open returned to Portrush following a 68-year hiatus. Then, a Thursday 79 led to a missed cut despite brave efforts in round two. This time, McIlroy finds himself just three from the early leaders.Harris English among a fascinating group of leaders after Open’s longest dayRead more“Absolutely incredible,” said McIlroy of his backing. “I feel the support of an entire country out there, which is a wonderful position to be in but at the same time, you don’t want to let them down. So there’s that little bit of added pressure.“I felt like I dealt with it really well today. Certainly dealt with it better than I did six years ago. I was just happy to get off to a good start and get myself into the tournament.“I was sort of surprised. There’s a few guys at four under, but I’m surprised four under is leading. I thought someone might have gone out there and shot six or seven today. Only three back with 54 holes to go, I’m really happy with where I am.”Asked to compare his emotions with 2019, McIlroy said: “I knew what to expect. It wasn’t new to me. So I think just having that experience of six years ago was definitely helpful. I didn’t feel like I was walking into the unknown this time around, where last time I hadn’t experienced that before.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

You have to go back more than two decades – to Leeds Rhinos in 2004 – to find the last time a new team won the Grand Final for the first time.There is still a long way to go and there is another team in the shape of the current league leaders, Hull KR, who would fancy ending that wait come October. But right now, it is impossible to argue againstLeigh Leopardsbeing viewed as bona fide title contenders and another who could lift the Super League title aloft for the first time this year.At a time when rugby league has once again closed the door on promotion and relegation between Super League and the Championship, Leigh’s journey is a timely reminder as to how that may not be such a clever idea. Three years ago to the day, they were beating Dewsbury Rams in the second tier on the way to promotion.Dagnall try extends St Helens’ winning run over Leeds and lifts them into thirdRead moreNow, Adrian Lam’s side are deservedly in the mix for a first league title since 1982. This small Lancashire town has been reinvigorated. A month ago, they conceded 50 points against Leeds and with games against Hull KR, Wigan andSt Helenson the horizon, it was easy to wonder if they could fade out of the playoff mix altogether.But wins in all of those games, the latest another statement success here to ensure a first win at St Helens in evermore than 40 years, have propelled them firmly into the picture for a top-two finish come the playoffs. That comes with immense benefits; the opening weekend off, plus a home semi-final to boot.That Leigh are now just one point behind second-placed Wigan and three behind Hull KR is credit to the work Lam and his side have done. Here, they were magnificent from start to finish, with two tries from Joe Ofahengaue capping a measured and outstanding performance.They have all the hallmarks of a champion team. “We’ve worked really hard on performances like that,” Lam admitted post-match. “It’s been a tough month but we’ve been fantastic. We’re so connected as a group, which I love.”Had the Saints made it six wins in succession here, it would have been Paul Wellens’ side in pole position to chase down the top two of Hull KR and Wigan. But this was a backwards step for them, with their attack poor all evening.Harry Robertson’s try in the final seconds was mere consolation, though it did spare them from being nilled at home in the Super League era for the first time. “I thought on the balance of play, Leigh deserved that victory,” Wellens said. “This was a timely reminder that we’ve still got some work to do.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionLeigh led 4-0 at half-time courtesy of two penalties from Gareth O’Brien. It was a tight, intense affair that felt like a playoff match but whereas the Saints opted to go for tries from their prime attacking penalties, the Leopards kicked for goal on three occasions, and O’Brien converted two of them.The first try always felt as though it would be crucial. And as the game entered the final quarter, Leigh scored it as Ofahengaue cut through on the angle to give O’Brien a simple conversion to make it 10-0. Any sort of response from the Saints was muted, and when Ofahengaue scored his second with five minutes left, there would be no way back.Robertson’s consolation at least spared the Saints from setting one unwanted record, but this was a night all about their opposition and what they could achieve in the months ahead.Explore more on these topicsSuper LeagueRugby leagueLeigh LeopardsSt HelensnewsShareReuse this content"

Enough time for the moment to grow even bigger. And for memories to flicker spitefully back to life.Finally the call comes. “This is game number 46. On the tee from Northern Ireland,Rory McIlroy.”There is a nod of acknowledgment. A few encouraging cries of “Goo-wan Rory”. But mostly the vast crowd is silent, nervous, mumbling its prayers.The Open 2025: Fitzpatrick in five-way tie for Open lead as Scheffler and McIlroy lurk – liveRead moreThey know. He knows. Even if what happened the last time McIlroy stood here, on the opening day of the 2019 Open, is a subject to tiptoe around. The angsty swipe of a two-iron. The ball hurtling towards the out-of-bounds. The six cries of ‘sit, sit!’ The quadruple bogey eight.As in 2019, there is a right-to-left wind off the 1st tee, and out-of-bounds on the left and right. It looks eerily familiar. But McIlroy stays in the present. He looks up four times before the club is finally swung and the ball hit. But, as he picks up his tee, takes massive gulps of relief.It is not a great shot, in truth. It’s left and in the shrubbery. But it is safe. And on a 420-yard hole that has already caused 25 bogeys, four double bogeys, and a seven by the time McIlroy tees off at 3.10pm, that is a result.The Northern Irishman’s second is steered to the back of the green, leaving him a difficult up and down from 70 feet. The first putt is excellent. The second horrendous. And McIlroy walks away with a bogey five.Still, on the bright side. he is already three shots better than he was at this stage in 2019. What happens on the 1st hole turns out to be a harbinger of what is to follow over the next five hours and 51 minutes.There are too many loose drives. Too many hooks and cries of fore left. But McIlroy is able to hold it together – with the help of alucky bounce here and there– before finishing with a flourish.View image in fullscreenRory McIlroy sinks a monster putt for birdie on the 5th hole at Royal Portrush.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianAnd when he makes his final putt of the day, shortly after 9pm, he is able to sign for a one-under par 70 which is nine shots better than his opening round in 2019.But it was often a hard slog, in front of a hugely expectant crowd. When McIlroy and his playing partners, Justin Thomas and Tommy Fleetwood, walked to the par-five 2nd, the crowd was sometimes 10 deep in places.Those watching on the 2nd hole saw a repeat of McIlroy’s shot on the first, only this time his drive went 40 yards left of the fairway. No wonder he looked deeply annoyed as he walked towards the ball. And not even the marshal telling him “We got it” soothed his mood.Yet McIlroy got out of the thick stuff, and then sent his third to 15 feet before making birdie. Suddenly he was smiling, chatting to Thomas, at level par and looking good.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

When another one went astray at the 8th, he had missed all six fairways. Eventually it was to catch up with him with bogeys at 11, 12 and 14.When the Masters winner drives well, his game has an effortless flow to it. But when it is misfiring, he often becomes a raggedy genius, alternating between the squeamish and the sublime.But he was able to dig deep in the closing holes, with his approach on the 17th proving his shot of the day. Once again he had driven it way left. Only this time he not only could not see the flag stick but was in malicious rough. Yet not only did he get it out, but a fortuitous bounce left him with a 15-footer for birdie.When he made it, you could hear the cheers from the clubhouse. There was nearly another birdie on the last, but while that slipped by, McIlroy looked happy enough as he walked off the 18th.He knows it wasn’t a great day. But he is three shots behind the leaders and still very much in the hunt.Explore more on these topicsThe OpenRory McIlroyEuropean TourGolfPGA TourUS sportsanalysisShareReuse this content"

The first shower blew in right around the timeScottie Schefflergot to the 1st tee. He had the air of a stubborn parent who had made the mistake of hauling their kids out in the heedless belief that it was going to clear up any minute, and was now determinedly leading them into the local folk museum that had been recommended by the holiday home owners. Scheffler gritted his teeth and got on with it, pretending he was enjoying himself.“Was there a shot that stood out today for you, that you were really pleased with?” Scheffler was asked after his round. “No,” he said.The Open 2025: first round updates as Fitzpatrick shares lead at Royal Portrush – liveRead moreScheffler’s round was all ups and downs. He made birdies at the 3rd, where he holed an 18ft putt, and the 7th and 10th, but made bogeys at 9th and 11th when both his tee shots blew wide right into the rough. That put him one-under par by the time the weather finally changed, and he was able to pick up a couple more shots with back-to-back birdies at the 16th and 17th on his way back in. He finished with a 68, which was a hell of a round in the conditions. It left him a shot off the clubhouse lead, an auspicious position for him, and an ominous one for everyone else. For a man who says he doesn’t much care about winning, he is mighty good at it.Scheffler just doesn’t miss. “Even when you look at him and it looks like he’s hitting a bad shot, it doesn’t go in a bad spot,” said his playing partner Shane Lowry.The two of them were playing with Collin Morikawa. They made for an entertaining threesome, with six major championships between them. Lowry, born and raised in County Offaly, is the local favourite, and the sort of lunatic who seems to enjoy playing in these conditions. It’s hard to be sure, because he only ever seems to be scowling when he is out there. He has the rictus grimace of a farmer ploughing the lower 40 in a squall. Hewon the Open here in 2019by scoring 72 in weather so bad that the tee times were brought forward.

Gosh but he knows how to play in the wind and rain, even after all the years of warm-weather living in Florida. He was two-under through the first six holes, with birdies at the long par-five and the short par-three. He would have been better yet if he had only found his putting touch, but the ball always seemed to sit up inches from the cup. Soon enough he was striding around the greens like a bear just out of hibernation, swatting at the ball like he was trying to bat a passing salmon with his paw.A couple of three-putts when the weather was at its worst meant Lowry finished one under par, sealed with a two-putt from 60ft on the 18th, where his final 5ft par putt was cheered in by a packed grandstand of home fans.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A lot has been made of Scheffler’s curious remarks inhis press conference earlier this week, when he got himself in a tangle trying to describe what motivates him. To be honest, Scheffler is the straight-down-the middle sort who might think twice about trying to spell existential crisis out loud, let alone talk about how he is suffering one. Morikawa, though, does seem unsure of himself these days. It is coming up on two years since his last victory, at the Zozo Championship in late 2023. He has used four different caddies in the past six months, and most of his headlines have been about his rows with the media.Out here Morikawa seemed to be on the wrong side of a running argument with his ball. “Sit, sit, sit,” he pleaded as it scuttled over into the long grass at the back of the 1st green, “go, go, go,” he urged as it dropped, plopped, and stopped short of the 4th. “Oh my God!” he bellowed as it flew way wide at the 7th, where it fetched up in a group of spectators gathered on top of one of the high dunes. His day didn’t get any better. He made three bogeys on the back nine, and finished four over par and as good as out of it. Like Lowry said: “Days like today, you can really play your way out of a tournament.”Explore more on these topicsThe OpenScottie SchefflerGolfEuropean TourPGA TourUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Gillis asked the crowd to “give it up for Taurasi”, but only after he had called the six-time Olympic champion “Deanna.” The camera showed an unsmiling Taurasi shaking her head. Gillis quickly caught his mistake, saying, “My bad on that.”Saturday Night Live: controversial comedian Shane Gillis struggles to make an impressionRead moreGillis then moved on to another basketball star,Caitlin Clark, who wasn’t at the ceremony as she deals with an injury ahead of this weekend’s WNBA All-Star game.“When Caitlin Clark retires from the WNBA, she’s going to work at a Waffle House so she can continue doing what she loves most: fist fighting Black women,” he joked. While some in the audience laughed, others appeared uncomfortable.Gillis continued on for 10 minutes, drawing a scattering of boos at one point, with jokes aboutDonald Trumpand Jeffrey Epstein.“Donald Trump wants to stagea UFC fight on the White House lawn. The last time he staged a fight in DC, Mike Pence almost died,” Gillis said. He then turned to Epstein, saying: “There was supposed to be an Epstein joke here, but I guess it got deleted.” Last week, the justice department and the FBIannounced that a review of the casefiles had confirmed that Epstein had killed himself, and there was no list of his clients to be made public.Gillis’ performance drew mixed reviews on social media, with some praising his criticism of Trump, while others criticized the racially charged reference to Clark at a time when WNBA playershave been the subject of online bigotry. Gillis wasdropped from the Saturday Night Live castin 2019 after podcast footage surfaced of him making racist, homophobic and misogynistic comments. Gillis apologized at the time, saying in a statement he was “a comedian who pushes boundaries” but who “sometimes missed”. He returned toguest host the show in 2024.Gillis was on safer ground when he took a light jab at reigning NBA MVP Shai Gilgeous-Alexander. The Canadian star, whowon the NBA titlewith the Oklahoma City Thunder in June, has attracted criticism for drawing fouls during games. He smiled when Gillis said: “SGA is here. Everybody sitting around him is in foul trouble.”Gillis also got a good reception for a joke about former New England Patriots coach Bill Belichick and his 24-year-old girlfriend, Jordon Hudson. “A bookie is what Bill Belichick reads to his girlfriend before bedtime,” said Gillis of the 73-year-old.Before he ended his monologue, a smiling Gillis said, “I see a lot of you don’t like me and that’s OK. That’s it for me. That went about exactly how we all thought it was going to go. I don’t know why this happened.”Gilgeous-Alexander and Simone Biles were named as best male and female athletes once the ceremony got under way. Gilgeous-Alexander led the Thunder to the franchise’s first title in Oklahoma City while also leading the NBA in scoring. “It’s a dream come true and for dreams to come true it takes a village,” he said, thanking his wife, parents, brother and others. “Those names probably don’t mean much but to me they mean everything.”View image in fullscreenSimone Biles accepts the best female athlete award.Photograph: Kevin Winter/Getty ImagesBiles, an 11-time Olympic medalist, also claimed the night’s first award, best championship performance for her efforts at the Paris Games. She won three golds and a silver at last summer’s Olympics. “That was very unexpected, especially in a category of all men,” Biles said after beating Stephen Curry, Freddie Freeman and Rory McIlroy to the championship performance award.Biles’ Olympic teammate, Suni Lee, won the best comeback award for overcoming two rare kidney diseases to help the US win team gold in Paris.

In December a ship carrying Russian oilwas seizedafter it severed cables between Finland and Estonia.Incidents around Taiwan over the past 18 months include aChinese-crewed freighter cutting cablesbetween the island and its outlying Penghu Islands in February by repeatedly manoeuvring in a zigzag pattern over the cables. The previous month, a Chinese-owned cargo ship was cited as the likely cause ofdamage to a Taiwan-US cable.The report said: “While it is difficult to definitively attribute recent incidents in the Baltic Sea and around Taiwan to state-sponsored sabotage, such operations align with both Russia and China’s strategic objectives, recently observed activities, and current deep-sea capabilities.”Recorded Future said a successful attack on multiple cables – which would cause prolonged disruption – would have to occur in deeper waters and would “very likely involve state-sponsored threat actors, due to the difficulty of accessing these sites”. Such an operation would probably take place before outright conflict, the report said.Recorded Future identified 44 cable damages over the past 18 months, a quarter caused by “anchor dragging” and nearly a third by “unknown causes”, with seismic activity or natural phenomena causing 16% of the incidents.View image in fullscreenAn undersea cable being laid in the Baltic Sea. Analysts say targeting these cables can be an attractive tactic because the damage can be passed off as an accident.Photograph: Lehtikuva/ReutersAnalysts added that damaging subsea cables could be an attractive tactic because it allowed states to target adversaries’ infrastructure via an unsophisticated method that could be passed off as an accident or be carried out by vessels without direct links to the attacks’ suspected sponsor.Recorded Future said improved monitoring of cables and security measures around subsea infrastructure, as well as comprehensive stress tests, would help prevent an incident damaging multiple cables and causing “prolonged connectivity issues”.Despite the high-profile Baltic and Taiwan incidents, the three most disruptive incidents were elsewhere: in the Red Sea in February last year when a Houthi missile caused a ship’s anchor to hit cables – leading to “significant impact on communication networks in the Middle East”; in west Africa a month later due to an underwater rock slide; and off the coast of South Africa in May 2024 due to a cable-dragging incident.Recorded Future said the impact of the Red Sea and Africa incidents showed that the most prolonged disruption happened in areas with limited availability of alternative cables and a shortage of repair expertise regardless of the cause of the disruption.Conversely, two attacks in the Baltic Sea in November last year had minimal impact due to spare capacity and Europe’s resilient internet infrastructure. However, the report said three EU island member states – Malta, Cyprus and Ireland – were more vulnerable due to their reliance on submarine cables for international communications.The UK government’s recent strategic defence review acknowledged the potential threat to the country’s subsea cabling and recommended that the Royal Navy takes a “new leading and coordinating role in securing undersea pipelines, cables, and maritime traffic carrying the information, energy, and goods upon which national life depends”.Explore more on these topicsTelecomsRussiaChinaAsia PacificEuropeInternetTaiwannewsShareReuse this content"

Now Hawaii is emerging as another possible victimDara KerrThu 17 Jul 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 17 Jul 2025 18.25 EDTShareThe north-westHawaiianisland of Mokumanamana is said to be touched by the gods. Bisected by the Tropic of Cancer latitude line, it is deep in the Pacific Ocean, about 400 miles from Honolulu. The island’s steep rocky cliffs give way to indigo blue waters dotted with monk seals and stony coral. No humans have lived on Mokumanamana, but it has the world’s highest density of ancient Hawaiian religious sites.“It sits as a boundary between what Native Hawaiians refer to as ‘pō’, the darkness, and ‘au’, the light,” said William Aila, the former chair of Hawaii’s department of land and natural resources. “When a Hawaiian passes, their soul makes its way from wherever it is in the main Hawaiian Islands, up to the North-western Hawaiian Islands. And at that juncture, at pō, they’re met by their ancestors.” As Aila tells it, if a person has been good, they can pass intopōand be with their ancestors, who inhabit the Pacific waters west of Mokumanamana.The hundreds of miles of ocean that surround Mokumanamana and other Hawaiian islands are now under threat, according to environmentalists and scientists. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the agency that oversees air and space travel in the US, announced in May that it had givenElon Muskpermission to detonate rocket ships from his companySpaceXover these protected waters.SpaceX first brought its request, a proposal called the Starship Super Heavy Project, to the FAA in 2022. In 2023, the company was given a license to launch its massive Starship rocket five times a year. In 2024, Musk proposed quintupling that number to 25 a year. SpaceX’s launch base is located in Boca Chica, Texas,surrounded by a state parkand federal wildlife refuge. To date, 10 Starship rockets have attempted to take off from there, the majority of which have ended in scattershot explosions, blasting metal shrapnel and debris from the Gulf of Mexico to the Indian Ocean.In conjunction with the increased number of launches, Musk proposed expanding the area in the Pacific Ocean where debris from his exploded Starships can land by roughly 75 times its original scope. This new area encompasses vast regions throughout the Pacific, including around the eight main Hawaiian islands, Mokumanamana and the entire north-west Hawaiian chain of islands – which lie within the Papahānaumokuākea marine national monument, a Unesco world heritage site.A map showing SpaceX’s expansion into the PacificThe monument is considered one of the most ecologically unique and diverse areas in the world, with 7,000 species of birds, turtles, marine mammals, fish and coral, some of which are critically endangered. It is also the largest protected area on Earth, covering nearly 600,000 sq miles of water. Ancestors of modern Hawaiians explored the open ocean here, navigating by stars. During Joe Biden’s final days in office, his administrationdesignated the monument as a sanctuary, giving it enhanced legal protections.OnceSpaceXramps up launches, bird and sea life could face hazardous material spills, falling objects and sonic booms, according to thousands of pages of government documents reviewed by the Guardian and interviews with more than a dozen people, including oceanographers, aerospace engineers, former government employees, lawyers and Hawaiian residents. They fear Musk’s “fail fast” approach to rocket launches, along with his ties to the US government, could mean SpaceX will have free rein over the region. Many in Hawaii say the FAA’s review of potential environmental consequences is not thorough enough.“We, especially as Native Hawaiians who have a special relationship to that place, simply want an honest and true assessment of the risk before consenting to the raining of thousands of pieces of a failed rocket,” said Aila, who is also the former chair of Papahānaumokuākea’s advisory council.Before and after map of the splashdown site for Starship rockets near HawaiiMusk, the world’s richest person, has framed his SpaceX expansion plan as existential, crucial to the survival of the human race. One day in the not-so-distant future, he says, the development of SpaceX’s Starship rocket will culminate in his ultimate goal of colonizing the planet Mars.Starship is the largest and most powerful spaceship ever built, standing 40 stories tall when all its parts stack. It’s designed to eventually be fully reusable and comes equipped with a Super Heavy booster and engines that burn methane gas and liquid oxygen. Musk originallycodenamed itBFR (Big Fucking Rocket).“Starship is the first design of a rocket that is actually capable of making life multiplanetary,” Musk said in aspeechlast year. “We don’t want to be one of those lame one-planet civilizations. We want to be a multiplanetary civilization, ultimately be a multi-stellar civilization, be out there among the stars.”For Musk, the cost of harming the delicate ocean ecosystem is outweighed by the benefits of space exploration.“If the [Starship] did hit a whale, it’s like, honestly, that whale had it coming, cause the odds are so low,” Musksaid in Octoberwhile campaigning for Donald Trump. “It’s like Final Destination: The Whale Edition. It’s like fate had it in for that whale.”Musk, SpaceX and the White House did not return requests for comment.Sonic booms, oil spills and damaged birds’ nestsWhen a Starship detonates and plunges to the sea, there are three possible outcomes, according to the FAA. First, it could have a hard landing at “terminal velocity”, which would cause the rocket to break apart on impact creating an “explosive event” on the water’s surface. Second, it could have a “soft water landing and tip over and sink”. Or lastly, the rocket could break up during atmosphere re-entry, causing debris to scatter across the ocean.In the run-up to the FAA’s approval of SpaceX’s 25 launches a year, federal agencies that work with endangered species issued biological opinions on the possible impact of these three scenarios.View image in fullscreenA juvenile green sea turtle in the Papahānaumokuākea marine national monument, which is home to more than 7,000 marine species.Photograph: NOAA/AlamyThe National Marine Fisheries Service saiddozens of species would be “affected”, including various species of whale, turtle, seal, fish, shark, coral and other ocean life. The agency specifically pointed to three types of sea turtle – green, Kemp’s ridley and loggerhead – as being “adversely affected”. Those adverse effects could come from things like sonic booms, falling debris and fuel and oil spills, according to the agency.In its biological opinion, the Fish and Wildlife Service retraced what went wrong during Starship’s first seven test launches in Boca Chica, Texas. The first launch pulverized the launchpad and sent chunks of concrete flying several miles throughout the wildlife refuge. The second flight went without incident, but the third ignited two brush fires, and the fourth tossed metal sheeting into the surrounding state park and damaged eggs in nine birds’ nests. The following three flights resulted in singed vegetation, a tornado-like “gravel plume” and the carcasses of a black-necked stilt and brown pelican.Despite the federal agencies’ foreboding assessments, they concluded the impact from twice-monthly Starship launches would probably be rare, and thus “insignificant”. The Fish and Wildlife Service declined to provide further comment. A spokesperson for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa), which heads the marine fisheries service, said it recommended conservation measures, like gathering acoustic data on explosions and monitoring falling debris.The FAA came to the same “no significant impact” conclusion in its final90-page environmental assessmentof SpaceX’s proposal. The agency acknowledged the potential threats but said they would be infrequent and the risk was low. As a result, the FAA approved a five-year license for 25 Starship launches a year and allowed for the vast zone in the Pacific to be a debris “action area”. If rocket detritus falls outside the permitted zone, the FAA or other federal agencies may investigate, though the approval does not delineate specific penalties.Small multiple chart showing how Space X can now launch 25 rockets per yearThe FAA assessment bears a major caveat, though: it was in effect prepared by SpaceX itself. SpaceX employees and consultants from the firm SWCA, hired by SpaceX, authored the 90-page document, according to its list of preparers. Four FAA employees were listed as “independent evaluators”. A separate 106-page biological assessment the FAA used to evaluate Starship’s impact on endangered species was also prepared by another company hired by SpaceX, the defense contractor ManTech SRS Technologies.An FAA spokesperson said applicants may prepare environmental assessments (EA) for the agency, and if they do, “the FAA advises and assists the applicant during preparation of the EA and independently evaluates and takes responsibility for the EA before it is published.”This environmental assessment, which wasfirst published in 2022and later updated, is the crux of a lawsuit brought against the FAA by a coalition of non-profits. They say the assessment was not sufficient and violates the National Environmental Policy Act. The coalition is calling for the FAA to conduct what’s known as anEnvironmental Impact Statement, which would require a more rigorous review of SpaceX’s impact to endangered species as well as consultation with Native Hawaiians and other cultural groups.“These documents were all put together by SpaceX, and then the FAA just sort of signed off on them as its own work,” said Jill Heaps, the senior legal director for the Surfrider Foundation, which is part of the coalition. “It’s the FAA’s duty to take a hard look at the potentially significant impacts to marine life … They’re asking for a very large geographic area in which these pieces can be dumped into the ocean, some of which might be near the Rice’s whale, some of which are near very sensitive areas around Hawaii.”View image in fullscreenMidway Atoll and its surrounding reef in the Papahānaumokuākea marine national monument.Photograph: ZUMA Press, Inc./AlamyWhen asked why the FAA didn’t issue an impact statement, the agency spokesperson said the assessment “provides a full discussion of the reasonably foreseeable effects of issuing a license for SpaceX’s proposed operations”.Rockets are a conglomeration of materials, such as heavy metals, plastics, wiring and chemicals. When one explodes, it typically breaks into several separate pieces, said Ella Atkins, a professor and department head of aerospace and ocean engineering at Virginia Tech. “That includes the shell on the outside, and the fuel tanks and the engines and all of the piping … Whatever fuel that is still remaining that is unburned will come down wherever it is.”The big stainless steel side panels of the rocket could float for a while and be retrieved before they eventually sink, said Atkins. The denser pieces, like parts of the engine, would immediately plummet to the sea floor. She said all three of the explosive scenarios laid out by the FAA could harm marine life.Discarding those materials into the water could also have unforeseen consequences, said Britta Baechler, the director of ocean plastics research for the environmental non-profit Ocean Conservancy. Damaging a coral reef could kill not only the coral, but the ecosystem that depends on it, everything from marine mammals and birds to the fish they survive on, she said.“Throughout history, we’ve looked at the ocean as a dumping ground, like it’s too big to fail, like ‘the solution to pollution is dilution,’” Baechler said. “And that’s really not the case.”‘Success is uncertain, but entertainment is guaranteed’SpaceX has an extensive history of scattering rocket ship debris into the ocean. In the early days of the company, it struggled to find permission to launch its rockets. So, in 2005, the company set its sights on a tiny, remote atoll in the Marshall Islands, called Kwajalein.In the four years SpaceX spent in Kwajalein, the company successfully launched two of its small Falcon 1 rockets for the first time. But it took several failures to get there. The inaugural Falcon 1 launch ended in a blaze with the rocket plummeting into the ocean, showering burning debris across a nearby coral reef. According to an account by Wired published in 2007, the spaceship’s payloadbarreled through the roof of SpaceX’s own machine shop, and a fuel slick spread offshore. The company said it retrieved 75% of the detonated debris.Since then, SpaceX has made tremendous strides. It has launched hundreds of Falcon rockets and is now responsible for delivering cargo and crew to and from the International Space Station. The company says it has also sent more than 7,800 Starlink satellites into orbit, more than half of all active satellites in space.View image in fullscreenElon Musk gives Donald Trump and lawmakers a tour of the SpaceX control room in Texas before a Starship test flight in November 2024.Photograph: Brandon Bell/ReutersStarship is SpaceX’s new frontier – a rocket built with the goal of making it to Mars – but it’s still a work in progress. The majority of its 10 test flights have encountered fatal errors, with the entire ship engulfed in flames and scant parts left to be reused.Musk has a “fail fast, learn faster” approach to his companies. As far back as 2005, shortly before SpaceX got set up in KwajaleinMusk said in an interviewthat, “There’s a silly notion that failure’s not an option at Nasa. Failure is an option here. If things are not failing, you are not innovating enough.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The colossal spaceship took off from Boca Chica, but quickly suffered engine failure. Just above the Earth, the rocketstarted to spin out of control, and SpaceX was forced to detonate the ship. The problemstarted during takeoff, when Starship demolished its launchpad, pulverizing it, sending hunks of concrete flying six miles away.The blast ignited a grassfire that burned nearly four acres of state park and, from what is known, it destroyed a nest of bobwhite quail eggs and a collection of blue land crabs, according tointernal emails Bloomberg obtainedfrom the Fish and Wildlife Service. The loud boom also sent a pair of endangered snowy plovers fleeing, and, while they were gone, a wildlife scientist’s “game camera” caught a coyote eating two of their three nest eggs.The FAA blamed the failure on “multiple root causes” andcited 63 actionsSpaceX needed to implement, including the redesign of Starship’s hardware to prevent leaks and fires as well as the redesign of its launchpad. According to the biography Elon Musk by Walter Isaacson, when SpaceX first built the launchpad in 2020, Musk demanded it not have a flame trench dug underneath the mount, as most pads have.View image in fullscreenSpaceX’s Starship explodes during its first test launch on 20 April 2023.Photograph: Joe Skipper/Reuters“We don’t want to design to eliminate every risk,” Musk told Isaacson after the episode. “Otherwise, we will never get anywhere.”In 2025 alone, four more of SpaceX’s Starship rockets exploded. The first, in January, ignited into a fireball that lit up the sky from the Bahamas to Haiti. The FAA needed toreroute dozens of commercial airline flightsto avoid falling debris. Afterwards, residents of Turks and Caicos said their islands werelittered with spacecraft remains. SpaceX had originally planned a “controlled splashdown” in the Indian Ocean an hour after takeoff, but the explosion happened just nine minutes into Starship’s journey.“Success is uncertain, but entertainment is guaranteed!” Muskposted to X.Then, in March, May and June, more Starships exploded.The May blast ended with heaps of debris, including combustion tanks and metal and plastic fragments,washing up on Playa Bagdadin Matamoros, Mexico – putting in jeopardy thousands of hatchling Kemp’s ridley sea turtles,according to environmental groups. The Mexican president, Claudia Sheinbaum, sent government officials to the beach to survey the damage. Meanwhile, the June Starship went up in flames. Days later, Sheinbaumthreatened to sue SpaceX, concluding “there is indeed contamination” on Playa Bagdad.Billions in government funding and cuts to federal agenciesIn mid-January, the FAA held a virtual meeting on Musk’s Starship plan that was open to the public. Texas and Hawaii residents logged on, most of whom were deeply opposed to the project. Lynda Williams, a retired physics professor and activist who lives in Hilo, Hawaii, was the first to speak. She had been trying for months to get word out about Musk’s plans andwrote an op-edemphasizing the fact that Hawaii residents and officials hadn’t been consulted.During the meeting, Williams said she focused her comments on the idea that “Earth is not a sacrifice zone for Elon Musk’s ego trip to Mars”. She said she wanted to “shred his [talking point about], you know, ‘we have to extend the light of consciousness and go to fucking Mars’, which is just a whole Trojan-Horse bullshit lie”.View image in fullscreenA Starship rocket explodes during a SpaceX test launch on 18 June 2025.Photograph: rocketfuture.org via APSeveral meeting participants spoke about the fact that SpaceX is a private commercial company using public resources for profit. The aerospace giant has received billions in government contracts and stands to be awarded much more. Themajority of its fundingis from Nasa and the Department of Defense. According to a Nasa spokesperson, the agency has invested more than $16bn in SpaceX through numerous contracts.The FAA also opened a written public comment period, and more than 12,000 comments poured in over a two-month period that ended on 17 January. Comments flowed from south Texas, where residents havelived with rumbling SpaceX launchesand their deafening booms for half a decade. “It is terrifying for residents to wake up to what feels like earthquakes,” said one commenter. Another pleaded, “Please stop the destruction of our lands for profit.”Some people voiced support for the project, including dozens who used the same template to argue that quintupling rocket launches would help in “maintaining American leadership in space relative to global competitors like China”. Several local suppliers also sent identical letters, but using their own letterhead.Just three days after the FAA closed the comment period on SpaceX’s proposal, Trump was inaugurated president. One of his first official acts was to sign anexecutive orderestablishing the so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge). Trump anointed Musk the de-facto leader – essentially handing him control over the personnel of the federal agencies meant to regulate his businesses.Michael Whitaker, the FAA chief, stepped down that same day. He had long been in the crosshairs of Musk, especially after the agencyfined SpaceX $633,000last September for allegedly violating its launch license over safety protocols. Muskwrote on Xthat he was suing the FAA for “regulatory overreach” andthat“the fundamental problem is that humanity will forever be confined to Earth unless there is radical reform at the FAA!” Days later, MuskpostedWhitaker “needs to resign”.Since then, with the backing of Trump, Doge hasfired hundreds of FAA employees. It has alsolaid off thousands of scientistswithdeep cutsto Noaa and the Fish and Wildlife Service, both of which manage Papahānaumokuākea.View image in fullscreenRed-tailed tropicbirds fly over the Papahānaumokuākea marine national monument.Photograph: White House Photo/AlamyThe relationship between Trump and Musk has frayed, but Trump has continued to slash funding for environmental projects and attack regulatory bodies that protect the environment. In the Pacific, he has signed executive orders thatallow for deep sea miningandopen up the Pacific Islands Heritage marine national monument, which is adjacent to Papahānaumokuākea, for commercial fishing.“The government is doing a number of things trying to reduce the influence and impact of environmental laws,” said Aila, the former chair of Papahānaumokuākea’s advisory council. “Who does that benefit? It benefits Elon Musk. And that should be a huge ethical issue.”‘The ocean is vast and cannot be avoided’Ancestors of the Hawaiians pioneered ocean exploration by the stars. But their culture of reverence could not be more different than Musk’s “fail fast” approach to space exploration.“It’s really easy to portray Indigenous Hawaiian ideals as anti-science, but I don’t think it’s that way at all,” said Kau’inohea Wawae’iole, a college student and resident of Puna, Hawaii, who said he was dismayed when he heard about SpaceX’s plans. “I think it’s just that we have a really deep connection to this place.”Similarly, when Kyle Kajihiro heard about the waters around Papahānaumokuākea being used as a place to dump rocket debris, he said he was reminded of how the Pacific has been treated for centuries. He’s an assistant professor of ethnic studies at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, whose family originally emigrated from Japan and has lived in Hawaii for five generations.“There’s a kind of way that the Pacific Ocean, Hawaii and other islands in the Pacific have been imagined by the powerful countries around the world as a kind of empty space,” Kajihiro said. “It’s like it’s this vast ocean with these tiny, remote specs that are insignificant. And so, that smallness and that idea of remoteness and isolation and distance means that the area can be used in this way.”In the lead-up to the FAA granting approval for SpaceX’s plan, the agency received a deluge of critical letters from local government bureaus, environmental groups and scientists, according to documents reviewed by the Guardian. One of those groups, the Surfrider Foundation, had been focused on SpaceX’s impact in Texas but is now looking at the Pacific too.View image in fullscreenA critically endangered Hawaiian monk seal and a Laysan albatross on the Midway Atoll in the Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument.Photograph: Hum Images/Alamy“The [environmental assessment] fails to analyze the impacts of exploding metal rocket pieces or other hazardous materials to sea life, including the ocean water quality, in the vicinity of protected marine habitat, or those that ultimately sink to the sea floor,” Surfrider leaders wrote in their letter, adding that SpaceX has shown no evidence it will avoid areas with endangered species.In response, the FAA told Surfrider its assessment doesn’t say all potential endangered species habitats would be avoided, “as the ocean is vast and cannot be avoided”.The FAA did make a concession, however. With its approval in May, the agency adjusted some of the boundaries where Starship debris is allowed to fall near the main Hawaiian Islands. It also added a 50-mile buffer zone around Papahānaumokuākea. The FAA said it made these revisions based on the outpouring of comments about harm to marine life and Hawaiian cultural resources, like the cluster of ancient religious sites on Mokumanamana.Kajihiro said that even though there are now boundaries around these sacred areas, he’s still concerned that Starship rockets could malfunction and debris will fall there.“They just see this as empty space,” Kajihiro reiterated. “But what Native Hawaiians have helped us to understand, and what other Pacific Island peoples in their history have understood, is that the ocean is really a fabric of connection between all of these civilizations.”Explore more on these topicsTechnologySpaceXElon MuskPacific islandsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

OpenAI, the developer of ChatGPT, has said its mission is to ensure AGI “benefits all of humanity”. Safety campaigners have warned that AGI could pose an existential threat by evading human control andtriggering a catastrophic event.The FLI’s report said: “The industry is fundamentally unprepared for its own stated goals.Companies claim they will achieve artificial general intelligence (AGI) within the decade, yet none scored above D in existential safety planning.”The index evaluates seven AI developers – Google DeepMind, OpenAI, Anthropic, Meta, xAI and China’s Zhipu AI and DeepSeek – across six areas including “current harms” and “existential safety”.Anthropic received the highest overall safety score with a C+, followed by OpenAI with a C and Google DeepMind with a C-.The FLI is a US-based non-profit that campaigns for safer use of cutting-edge technology and is able to operate independently due to an “unconditional” donation from crypto entrepreneurVitalik Buterin.SaferAI, another safety-focused non-profit,also released a report on Thursdaywarning that advanced AI companies have “weak to very weak risk management practices” and labelled their current approach “unacceptable”.The FLI safety grades were assigned and reviewed by a panel of AI experts, including British computer scientist Stuart Russell, and Sneha Revanur, founder of AI regulation campaign group Encode Justice.Max Tegmark, a co-founder of FLI and a professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said it was “pretty jarring” that cutting-edge AI firms were aiming to build super-intelligent systems without publishing plans to deal with the consequences.He said: “It’s as if someone is building a gigantic nuclear power plant in New York City and it is going to open next week – but there is no plan to prevent it having a meltdown.”Tegmark said the technology was continuing tooutpace expectations, citing a previously held belief that experts would have decades to address the challenges of AGI. “Now the companies themselves are saying it’s a few years away,” he said.He added that progress in AI capabilities had been “remarkable” since theglobal AI summit in Paris in February, with new models such as xAI’s Grok 4, Google’s Gemini 2.5, and its video generator Veo3, all showing improvements on their forebears.A Google DeepMind spokesperson said the reports did not take into account “all of Google DeepMind’s AI safety efforts”. They added: “Our comprehensive approach to AI safety and security extends well beyond what’s captured.”OpenAI, Anthropic, Meta, xAI, Zhipu AI and DeepSeek have also been approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)ComputingnewsShareReuse this content"

They are getting the oppositeJudith LevineThe rate of voluntary sterilization among young women jumped abruptly after Dobbs, and there’s no reason to believe it will drop offThu 17 Jul 2025 08.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 17 Jul 2025 12.54 EDTShareDobbs v Jackson Women’s Health Organization, theUS supreme courtcase that rescinded the constitutional right toabortion, is failing on its own terms. Since the ruling, in June 2022, the number of abortions in the US has risen. Support for reproductive rights is on the upswing. And the rate of voluntary sterilization among young women – a repudiation of Trumpian pronatalism, if a desperate one – jumped abruptly after Dobbs, and there’s no reason to believe it will drop off.Also rising at an alarming clip are preventable maternal deaths and criminal prosecutions of pregnant people.Yet the 21 state legislatures that have imposed total or near-total bans are doing little or nothing to give doctors legal leeway to save the health and lives of pregnant women in medical distress, even if that means inducing abortion. In fact, rather than trying to save lives, they are prosecuting pregnant people who handle those emergencies on their own.The first three – more abortions, more pro-abortion sentiment, more contraception –have frustrated the anti-abortion crowd no end. They know they need stronger disincentives to abortion.A baby born to a brain dead mother: this is the horror of abortion bans   | Moira DoneganRead moreWhich brings us to the latter two: more punishment and more death. Was punishment the aim all along? And has the anti-abortion movement accepted pregnant people’s deaths as an unfortunate consequence of saving the pre-born?According to theGuttmacher Institute, abortions rose 1.5% in 2024 from 2023, on top of a 11.1% leap in the first year after Dobbs, compared with 2020, before the near-bans enacted in several states that presaged the ruling.It’s also probably an undercount. The statistics include only “clinician-provided abortions”, either surgical or medical (using abortion pills), performed in healthcare facilities or via telemedicine. Guttmacher does not estimate how many abortions are happening outside the formal healthcare system, with drugs obtained directly from suppliers or through feminist underground networks.Indeed, Plan C, the country’s biggest clearinghouse for pill access,reports2m visits to itswebsiteand 500,000 click-throughs to resources and care in 2024, a 25% increase from the year before. How many of those people ended their pregnancies at home, with only a friend or lover in attendance? Anecdotal evidence gleaned from activists suggests they number in the tens of thousands.At the same time, rather than making abortion “unthinkable”, as the anti-abortion activists pledge, the bans may be having the opposite effect. Ananalysisof two restrictive states, Arizona and Wisconsin, and one with broad access, New Jersey, found that negative attitudes toward abortion are down and positive ones up, in both red and blue states.And if the goal of banning abortion is to produce more children, that’s not working either. Public health researchers saw “an abrupt increase in permanent contraception procedures” – sterilization – following Dobbs among adults in their prime reproductive years, ages 18 to 30. Unsurprisingly, the increase in procedures for women (tubal ligations) was twice that for men (vasectomies).The Trump administration is cheerleading for procreation. “I want more babies in the United States of America,” declared JD Vance in hisfirst public appearanceas vice-president, at the March for Life in Washington. He blamed the declining birth rate on “a culture of abortion on demand” and the failure “to help young parents achieve the ingredients they need to lead a happy and meaningful life”. The federal budget extends some of that help. It raises the annual child tax credit (CTC) from $2,000 to $2,200. It also creates “Trump accounts”, $1,000 per child, which parents or employers can add to.But only those with social security numbers are eligible for either program; the tax credit is available only to people who earn enough to pay taxes; and as with any investment, those able to sow more in the savings accounts reap more. It’s clear what sort of baby the administration wishes to be born: white babies with “American” parents, and not the poorest.The carrots are not appetizing enough. The stick is not effective enough. So red-state legislators and prosecutors are ramping up the punitive approach.This year, Republican lawmakers inat least 10 statesintroduced bills defining abortion as homicide, and, for the first time, criminalizing both the provider and the patient.No such bill has passed – yet–and anti-abortion organizations are usually quick torenouncethem publicly, nervous about widespread opposition. Buttheir passage might not be far off. The bills are based onfetal personhood– the concept of conferring full legal rights to a fetus from conception forward. The idea was introduced in 1884 and finally written into one state’s law in 1986. By 2024, 39 states had fetal homicide laws. Last year, there werethree billscriminalizing the person who has an abortion; now there are 10. And though the federal courts rejected fetal personhood for a century, it is the bedrock of anti-abortion politics, and this US supreme court is looking much more friendly toward it.Conservatives are trumpeting a new abortion-pill study. One problem: it’s bogus | Moira DoneganRead moreWhile they work toward straightforward criminalization of ending one’s own pregnancy, anti-abortion lawmakers and prosecutors are making creative use of existing law to punish miscarriage, an event indistinguishable from elective abortion, just in case the pregnant person induced the miscarriage. The most ghoulish is the prohibition on abusing corpses.For instance: last week a 31-year-oldSouth Carolina womanwho miscarried and disposed of the tissue in the trash was arrested for “desecration of human remains”, a crime carrying a 10-year sentence. In March, awomanfound bleeding outside her Georgia apartment after a miscarriage was jailed for “concealing the death of another person” and “abandonment of a dead body” for placing the remains in the bin. A week before that, aPennsylvania teenagerwas under investigation for corpse abuse after a self-managed pill abortion and burial of the fetus in her yard.In a grim sense, these are the lucky ones: they survived. Because Dobbs has indisputably been deadly.“Mothers living in states that banned abortion were nearly twice as likely to die during pregnancy, childbirth, or soon after giving birth” as mothers living in states where abortion was legal and accessible, reports theGender Equity Policy Institute. Maternal mortality rose 56% in Texas after it enacted a six-week ban; a Texan’s risk was one and a half times that of a Californian’s.The future isn’t sunny.A studyof 14 total-ban states predicts that in the four years beginning a year after Dobbs, up to 42 mothers will die and as many as 2,700 will be afflicted with “severe maternal morbidity”, defined by theCDCas “unexpected outcomes of labor and delivery that result in significant short-term or long-term [health] consequences”. In one analysis Black women represented 63% of the deaths.The anti-abortion movement is indefatigable. “We abolishioners will not rest until we have effected the abolishment of human abortion,” one leader toldOklahoma Voice. But this is an unattainable grail. Where abortion is illegal, people still have abortions. They just take more risks.Globally, more than 39,000 women die yearly from unsafe abortions.As they run out of options, red-state lawmakers will harden criminal penalties against people who refuse to give up their reproductive self-determination. It may grow less outré to endorse Trump’sopinion, expressed in an unguarded moment, that women who get illegal abortions “deserve some form of punishment”. Whether intentional or not, the sentence for some of those women will be death.Judith Levine is Brooklyn-based journalist, essayist and author of five books.

Trump so far has largely given Israel carte blanche to continue its genocide inGaza, but Benjamin Netanyahu would be remiss to count on the fickle and self-serving American president. And there may be a way to turn Trump around.Most US presidents have stuck with the Israeli government regardless of its atrocities because the political fallout of deviating was too high. Any pressure on Israel would be sure to trigger outrage from Christian evangelicals (Israel’slargestgroup of supporters in the US) and the conservative segment of American Jews represented by the lobbying groupAipac.Trump is less susceptible to such pressure because there is no major political figure to his right. Israel’s supporters can complain, but they have no place to turn.Trump has already used that latitude to differ from the Israeli prime minister on a range of issues. Heliftedsanctions on the interim Syrian authorities when Netanyahu preferred acrippledneighbor. He struck adealwith Houthi forces in Yemen to stop attacking shipping without insisting on an end to attacks on Israel. He authorizeddirect negotiationswith Hamas, which Netanyahu considered anathema, and initially pursuednegotiationswith Iran while Netanyahupreferredimmediate bombing. He visited the Arab Gulf stateswithoutstopping in Israel. And he putpressureon Netanyahu twice to agree to temporary ceasefires in Gaza.In other respects, Trump has supported the Netanyahu government. Heauthorizedrenewed delivery of the 2,000-pound bombs that Joe Biden had suspended because Israel wasusingthem to decimate Palestinian neighborhoods. Hevetoeda UN security council call for an unconditional ceasefire. He imposedsanctionson the international criminal court (ICC) prosecutor forchargingNetanyahu and former defense minister Yoav Gallant with the war crime of starving and depriving Palestinian civilians. He also sanctionedtwo ICC judgesfor affirming the charges, anda UN special rapporteurfor accurately reporting on and denouncing Israel’s genocide.But Netanyahu could find it perilous to count on Trump. Despite the periodicshowsof mutual support, there seems to beno love lostbetween the two men. Moreover, Trump’s mood changes with the weather. He can turn on a dime with barely a blush. His loyalty is foremost to himself. His only lodestar is his political or financial self-interest.There are plenty of reasons for the transactional Trump to sour on Netanyahu. While Trumpbellyachesabout the funds spent to defend Ukraine’s democracy from Vladimir Putin’s invasion, the US government has sent more than$22bnto Israel to sustain its war in Gaza, with no end in sight (more than$300bnsince Israel’s founding in 1948). Netanyahu seems to treat an open spigot from Washington as an entitlement, but Trump can easily develop an allergy to such enormous expenditures.Then there is Trump’s ego. Netanyahu’spronouncementduring his White House visit this month that he had nominated Trump for a Nobel peace prize was cringe-worthy in its pandering, especially from a man whose willingness to relentlessly kill Palestinian civilians as avehicleto retain power and avoid pending corruption charges is the main obstacle to a ceasefire.But Trump seems genuinely towanta Nobel peace prize. That won’t happen by underwriting the ethnic cleansing of Gaza, which Trump initiallyproposedand Netanyahu’s far-right ministers, who are capable ofcollapsinghis governing coalition, aredemanding. Nor will it come from sequestering Palestinians in a “concentration camp”, as former Israeli prime minister Ehud Olmert describes theproposalof the Israeli defense minister, Israel Katz, to confine Palestinians on the ruins of a corner of Gaza.Trump would deserve accolades for truly ending the conflict and enabling the rebuilding of Gaza. But the conflict is unlikely to truly end, and the Gulf Arab stateswill be reluctant to pony up the billionsneeded for reconstruction, for a mere return to theapartheidthat Israel has imposed on Palestinians in the occupied territory. A Nobel-worthy end to the conflict would bea Palestinian stateliving side-by-side with an Israeli one.Netanyahu has devoted hiscareerto avoiding that possibility. The massivesettlemententerprise is designed to preclude it. But because none of the alternatives – mass expulsion, endless apartheid or equal rights in asingle state– is morally or politically viable, a Palestinian state is the best option.It is difficult to imagine Trump pushing for a Palestinian state. He has appointed an ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, whosevisionfor a state is to put it anywhere but in Palestine. But if Trump’s quest for accolades, his bid for the history books, takes priority in his mind, which is entirely possible, we should not discount this turn of events.Trump turned on Putin last week when heproclaimed: “We get a lot of bullshit thrown at us by Putin, if you want to know the truth. He’s very nice all the time, but it turns out to be meaningless.” That describes Netanyahu to a T.Why does Trump let Netanyahu keep playing him the way Putin did? How can Trump proclaim himself the Master Negotiator when he can’t manage to use his enormous leverage over Netanyahu to get him to stop bombing and starving Palestinian civilians? Is Trump not sophisticated enough to move from real-estate deals to international negotiations?I’m sure that Trump would hate to be asked these questions. The sycophants around him won’t. Others can and should. Trump’s fragile ego, his insatiable need for praise, may be the Palestinians’ best chance of turning him in a constructive direction.Kenneth Roth, former executive director of Human Rights Watch (1993-2022), is a visiting professor at Princeton’s School of Public and International Affairs.

When the first airstrike slammed into the building, Ali ran: not away from danger but towards it, risking his own safety for mine. That morning, as subsequent strikes rattled the walls around us and as I phoned my sister (“Tell Mum and Dad I love them heaps – just in case”), Ali remained by my side.Seldom in history have healthcare workers been called upon to risk their lives simply by reporting for duty.I am not referring to people such as myself – the internationally mobile staff who fly freely in and out of crisis zones, quietly reassured that safety awaits us at the end of our assignments. We return home to security, to family and, sometimes, to applause. Occasionally we are even lauded as heroes. But “hero” is a label I reject. It does not belong to me.It belongs to those who don’t have the option to leave: the Palestinian healthcare and humanitarian workers who have reported for duty every single day for 650 days under siege. Working alongside them has been the greatest honour of my life.And the children we care for – they too carry their own brand of heroism.Israeli strike kills at least 10 children queueing for medical treatment in GazaRead moreI think of Nayla*, a 10-year-old girl who came to our field hospital after an airstrike. Her limbs were shattered – and the pressure generated from the shock wave was so immense that her stomach and small intestine had perforated. Her mother, along with her brother, had died in the same strike that left her small body riddled with holes. By then the blockade had ensured our supplies were reduced to critically low levels. Rationing the fuel to run our operating theatres, short on surgical supplies for her fractures and gastrointestinal repairs, and without the specialised nutrition needed to keep her alive, Nayla fought. She was so malnourished that her wounds refused to heal. Infection invaded her bones. The night Nayla awoke from her coma I lay awake in my tent, listening to her screams – she cried for a mother who would never come.Then there were the young siblings, lying side by side. Their bodies had been torn apart by shrapnel and the fragments embedded so deeply that the surgeons had to dig them out, one by one.Just a few feet away lay the bruised and mottled body of a four-month-old orphan. His leg was encased in plaster, after having been broken before he could even learn to crawl. There would be no one to carry him – he had already lost both parents in a separate airstrike two months earlier.These stories were not exceptional. I heard them over and over – different voices and faces, but each story marred by the same injustice.What I witnessed in Gaza was not war – it was a massacre.In among this grief were the myriad staff who had been stripped of their homes and families – yet still travelled from the funerals of their own children and the rubble of their homes to care for the injured and dying. One doctor risked his safety walking four hours each way to complete his 24-hour shift, after airstrikes had rendered roads impassable.A small number even had a brief opportunity to flee in the early weeks of the war. They refused. They chose instead to farewell their families – perhaps for the last time – then quietly returned to their posts.A cursory glance at the reported data shows how real the risk is. Conservative estimates show that airstrikes, shelling and gunshotshave killedmore than1,580 healthcare workers and almost 18,000 children.These are not just statistics. They are people I knew. They are the people who stayed.If our leaders allow this to pass without consequence or condemnation, it reveals a disturbing truth about what we are willing to accept: that the execution of healthcare workers and the slaughter of children has become our new norm.The steps needed to save these children – and the workers risking their lives to care for them – are not just nebulous ideals.Australia must demand an unequivocal end to the blockade andweaponisation of aid. The fortnight prior to my departure from Gaza, the specialised nutrition that Nayla had needed initially wasn’t available in a single medical facility across the strip. I learned today that she will go on to have her leg amputated.We must demand an end to the bombing of hospitals and bulldozing of ambulances. Al-Aqsa hospital has been targeted with airstrikes yet again since I was last there. Not a single ministry of health hospital remains fully functional.We must demand a permanent ceasefire so that doctors and nurses can care for victims of war, without laying down their own lives.When I think about heroism in the context of sacrifice, I think about Rifaat Radwan,one of 15 Palestinian emergency workersfound buried in a mass grave. He was shot while trying to rescue others. Just before he died, herecorded his final words: “Forgive me, Mama … This is the path I chose to help people.”His words echo those of my colleagues when I once pressed: “How do you keep going? Aren’t you exhausted?” She looked me in the eye, calmly: “Of course we’re tired. But this is our life now and this is probably how I die. If we die, we’ll do it saving as many lives as we can.”They are the real heroes. They are the ones who stay. And they deserve more than our silence.* Nayla isa pseudonym to protect patient confidentialityThienminh Dinh is an Australian specialist emergency physician and was the medical activity manager in Gaza for Médecins Sans FrontièresExplore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warOpinionChildrenChild protectionChild rightsGazaPalestinian territoriesMédecins Sans FrontièrescommentShareReuse this content"

In 1969, the UK became thefirst major democracy in the worldto lower the voting age from 21 to 18. Few people knew what to expect from this change.Things are different now. In places such as Austria, Argentina and Brazil, as well as parts of Germany and, in the UK, Wales and Scotland, 16- and 17-year-olds are already allowed to vote in some or all elections.We can learn a lot from these places about what happens when 16- and 17-year-olds get the vote. My colleagues and I have spent yearsresearchingthis, and our main finding is simple: nothing bad happens when the voting age is lowered to 16.Including 16- and 17-year-olds in the electorate does not change election outcomes and it does not make elections less representative. Sixteen- and 17-year-olds are just as qualified to vote as other, older voters. Research from Germany and Austria shows that they are able to pick a political party or representative that best represents their views to the same extent as other, slightly older voters.But some things may get better for young people and for democracy overall, especially if young people are taken seriously as voters and receive good education on political issues.Here is what to expect when 16- and 17-year-olds get to vote in the UK general election.Higher turnout among the youngest first-time votersWhen 16- and 17-year-olds get to vote at the next UK election, expect them to turn out in about the same numbers as other voters, and slightly more often than other first-time voters (those aged 18 to 20).In Austria, Latin America, Scotland, Wales and German federal states that lowered the voting age to 16, my colleagues and I consistently find that, when allowed to vote, 16- and 17-year-olds turn out at higher rates than young people who were enfranchised at age 18.We believe this happens because younger people who are in full-time education and often still live at home can make for better,more engagedfirst-time voters compared with 18- to 20-year-olds, who often experience their first election in a highly transitory phase of their lives, while moving out of the parental home, taking up work or further education.No major changes to election outcomesA lower voting age is unlikely to change election outcomes. Sixteen- and 17-year-olds make up between1.5% and less than 5%of the population in constituencies across the UK. They will have a very small impact on vote shares – and only in the most extreme (and improbable) scenario that all 16- and 17-year-olds turned out to vote and decided to vote in thesame way.Those who say that lowering the voting age to 16 is Labour’s move to secure more votes at the next general election might be mistaken. Young people as a group have diverse political attitudes; they do not all vote for the same political parties. In Brazil, young people voted quite similarly to other age groups in the 2022 presidential election and in Austria, where young peoplehave been enfranchised since 2007, the inclusion of 16- and 17-year-olds in the electorate did not change the political landscape.Even for marginal elections, such as Scotland’s 2014 referendum on independence, my colleague Jan Eichhorn from the University of Edinburghshowedthat the inclusion of 16- and 17-year-olds did not change the outcome of the referendum as the youngest first-time voters cast their votes in diverse ways.Political parties and a media that engage with younger votersAny political party can win the support of first-time voters. To do so, political parties have toengage with young peopleand offer attractive policy proposals, asLaura Serra shows.We might also see the media show more younger voters in their reporting. In 2014, BBC Scotlandraised the visibilityof 16- and 17-year-olds by creating a diverse panel of young first-time voters, who provided input into programmes, were panellists on productions on different political topics, and audience members for the final referendum TV debate.Young people who are allowed to vote also influence the adults in their lives. If young people are allowed to participate in elections at 16 and 17, when most are still living at home with their parents, they have the potential to shape political discussions within the family or household. In an ageing society, political parties and a media that engage with younger voters, and dinner-table conversations about political issues and across generations, can be a good outcome.A potentially stronger democracyIn the longer term, including 16- and 17-year-olds in the electorate might make democracy more resilient. InAustriaandLatin America, young people who were enfranchised at 16 or 17 were more satisfied with democracy and democratic institutions – parliament or political parties.The lowering of the voting age might also provide an opportunity to address inequalities in who participates in elections. Across all ages we see stark differences in who turns out to vote and who does not. After the lowering of the voting age in Scotland, however, we found 16- and 17-year-olds to beequally engaged with elections, regardless of their social background.Schools and colleges play a crucial role in compensating for the lack of parents or peers to get young people voting. Good and statutory civic education for all young people makes a big difference for democracy in the long term.Austriahas done well in combining the lowering of the voting age with a big reform of and investment in civic and citizenship education. InScotland, young adults who remembered taking classes in school in which political issues were discussed were more likely to turn out in elections throughout their 20s.Christine Huebner is a lecturer in quantitative social sciences at the University of SheffieldDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Perhaps Tony Blair could give him some tipsThu 17 Jul 2025 11.20 EDTLast modified on Thu 17 Jul 2025 14.29 EDTShareThis is a sign of weakness, not strength. Tosuspend four MPsfor rebellion suggests a lack of authority and a lack of nerve, not a sense of confidence. Bullying and threats are no way to manage a party, but a signal that Labour has lost control, with its crude methods in cutting winter fuel payments and its attempt to cut disability benefits. As MPs head off for the summer next week, Keir Starmer and the Labour whips hope they will be mulling over their futures, having been warned of the severe penalty for disloyalty. But I doubt that’s the message most will absorb.More than 120 MPssignalled their oppositionto the proposed welfare cuts, and many more agreed but didn’t sign the amendment. Was the solution to sack the lot? Or just the token “ringleaders”? In fact there were none, just a strong belief among backbenchers of all varieties that not only were the cuts wrong, they were badly done and would be politically damaging, as indeed they were. Those suspended are of the soft left, by no means Corbynites. Rachael Maskell is a bit of a moral grandstander, annoying other MPs by suggesting her conscience is clearer than theirs, but suspensions tend to play to those tendencies (though the four will find that once they are no longer representing Labour, they will lose their voice with broadcasters).A Labour aide boasted gleefully that these “heads on spikes” were intended as a warning shot to the new intake of MPs not to rebel, but it sounds like petty revenge for their success in forcing the leadership into U-turns. Don’t even think of sacking Diane Abbott again: it didn’t work out well. She would be away in the Lords now had the party not blundered last time, making her dig in her heels very effectively.Starmer is building quite a record for stamping down on dissent. He is the first prime minister tosuspend the whipfrom MPs in his first month in power. In fact, during that first month, when he punished the seven whovoted for an SNP motionto abolish the two-child benefit cap, he suspended more MPs than Tony Blair did during his decade in No 10, despite frequent rebellions. One senior Blair aide said Jeremy Corbyn wasn’t expelled even though “he voted more often against than for the government” (not strictly true, although he did vote against the government more than 400 times). I put that to a senior No 10 source, whose riposte was: “Well, Blair should have done! It would have saved us a lot of years in opposition.” Unlikely. If not Corbyn, it would have been someone else of his ilk.Parties need discipline. How did Blair maintain it sufficiently, without expulsions? A Blair aide said he paid close attention to his backbenchers, holding a daily morning meeting with the chief whips Hilary Armstrong and Jackie Smith, and weekly meetings with a rotating roster of MPs including regular rebels – even Dennis Skinner – to test the contents of his speeches ahead of time.Aides such as parliamentary private secretaries were delegated to nurture various groups of MPs – the women, the union supporters, the religious, the leftists, those with particular political issues or constituency concerns, those in marginals who kept their ears closest to the ground. If Blair disagreed with them, he said so and explained why. “Being listened to matters,” said the aide. But the whips weren’t supine or toothless. “They didn’t threaten but they could make MPs’ lives miserable,” the aide added, with measures such asdenying pairing.Things will get worse when MPs return from summer recess, with the autumn budget, the review of services for children with special educational needs and disabilities and a child poverty strategy that needs to rescind the two-child benefit cap, despite60% of the publicin favour of keeping it, including half of Labour voters.There will be many more opportunities for conflict in the party. The problem is profound. This is not about a handful of usual suspects, but a deep unease about the direction of the government, or whether it even has a direction beyond a random collection of policies. Discipline only works if there is a strong story that defines where a government is heading and why. Too many MPs do not believe Starmer’s story, especially after the U-turns they forced seemed to send Labour in a better, more coherent direction. Here’s an example: it’s brilliant that Starmer announced on Thursday that Labour willlower the voting age to 16, but where’s the more radical constitutional reform?MPs can get arrogant when they forget they owe everything to the party that selected, financed and organised for them. However talented or beloved they think they are, few manage to buck the trend of national swings. But that also makes them more anxious about the success of the national party. Many know they won’t be back after the next election, having won implausible seats by small majorities. The hailstorm of bad economic news in recent days depresses spirits: growth is lower than expected, inflation higher and unemployment up. “Give me lucky generals,” Napoleon is reputed to have said, but Rachel Reeves so far has not been one of them. Opinion polls are dismal, withLabourovertaken alarmingly by Reform UK. The summer holiday may be approaching, but the party’s MPs will go home glum.The way to bring them back in better fettle in September is to sharpen Labour’s purpose, build on the best policies of the first year and stop making others that alienate supporters without gaining new ones. Listen to MPs. Remember Aesop’s fable of the north wind and the sun competing to make a man remove his cloak. The north wind fails when it blows with all its might because the man wraps his cloak tighter around him, but when the sun shines he takes it off in the heat.

The story goes that the king suspected his new golden crown had been mixed with cheaper metals, but he didn’t want it damaged. Archimedes had to figure out whether the crown was pure gold without melting it down. Tough brief.Then, one day, while sinking into a public bath, he noticed something: the water level rose as he slid in. The volume of water displaced was equal to the volume of his body. That was it! The key. He could weigh the crown and measure its volume by how much water it displaced.Archimedes was so thrilled he reportedly leapt out of the bath and ran naked through the streets screaming, “Eureka!” – the sudden flash when your brain wanders off and comes back holding the answer like a prize.Boredom is not the enemy. It’s the invitationThese moments don’t usually happen when you’re trying: they happen when you’renot. When your brain is doing nothing, or at least pretending to. Walking. Driving. Showering. Zoning out in a university lecture. Or, say, a wife on the brink of divorce, nodding along while her husband’s mouth foams at the sides as he monologues about cryptocurrency.“I’m done,” she whispers. Eureka.There’s a scientific name for this wandering mind magic: the Default Mode Network (DMN). It’s your brain’s background mode, active when you’re not. It switches on when you’re daydreaming, reminiscing or imagining fake conversations you’ll never have. When you’re “doing nothing”, the DMN is doingeverything. It’s where creativity, reflection and unexpected insight come from.And one of its greatest allies? Boredom.Boredom is not the enemy. It’stheinvitation. A quiet stage your brain builds to see what might show up. But these days, we don’t let it. Boredom tries to knock, and we shove a screen in its face. The moment a little stillness arrives, in line, on the train, on the toilet, we reach for stimulation. Our brains never get to drop into the DMN. No daydreams. No deep thought. Just dopamine on loop.66 days to rediscover boredom: ‘The way I’d been thinking about time was wrong’Read moreEven Reddit noticed the death of the idle mind.r/Showerthoughts, the subreddit born in 2013, was a shrine to those aimless, brilliant, dumb observations that bubble up when you’re bored and wet. At its peak, it was full of lines like:“Your stomach thinks all potatoes are mashed.”“Clapping is just hitting yourself because you like something.”“Is Sand called Sand because it’s in between the sea and land?”It was silly, accidental genius. The internet’s record of DMN activity.But over time, it changed. The posts got shinier. Less“I just thought of this while shampooing”and more“I’ve been drafting this for three days in Photoshop.”People in the comments began calling it out: these weren’t shower thoughts any more. They were scheduled thoughts. Viral bait. Branded content in bullet point form.The shower thought had been domesticated. Trademarked. Monetised.But maybe it’s simpler than that. Maybe it’s not that the thoughts changed, maybe it’sus. The shower and the toilet used to be our last bastions of solitude. Now we bring our phones. People listen to full albums while exfoliating their scalp. Take business calls while walking the dog. Check emails mid-poo. There’s no more empty space for thought to wander through. We’ve filled every corner.And when there’s no space, there’s no spark.No boredom, no Eureka. No quiet, no insight. Just us, endlessly occupied.

Thesuperinjunctionwas originally expected to be in force from September to December 2023. Instead, it kept details of a national scandal hidden from public scrutiny for years in an extraordinary example of national security providing legal cover for a political crisis.In attempting to remedy the impact of the leak, both Conservative and Labour governments will end upspending £850m. Andthousands of Afghansand their families have been brought to the UK via a secret resettlement programme. These significant decisions made by multiple governments have never been publicly scrutinised. So how was this allowed to happen?In discharging the superinjunction on Tuesday, Mr Justice Chamberlainacknowledgedthat this was an “unprecedented case”. We are far more used to superinjunctions being granted in relation to celebrities than to protect state secrecy. Indeed, this was the first time that we know of that one was granted on the government’s application and represents a step change in the means that it has to prevent the spread of potentially harmful or embarrassing information.This was also the first superinjunction that we know of that was madecontra mundum. This meant that it was an offence for anyoneto speak publicly about the fact that there had been a data breach, the various and extensive efforts made to mitigate the harm of the breach, or that there were restrictions in place preventing the reporting of said breach.The legal remedies open to the government of today, in the form of superinjunctions, are far more wide reaching than any available to previous governments. The deployment of a superinjunction in relation to matters of national security may well mark a new frontier in the executive’s attempt to maintain state secrecy.However, what has been clearthroughout the various applications for extension of the superinjunction is that there was increasing judicial unease. Mr Justice Chamberlain considered in July 2024 that the superinjunction “could no longer be maintained” –due, in part, to the inability for public scrutiny to take place and to the fact that those impacted by the list were denied the opportunity to benefit from public pressure on the government to do more for them.The court of appeal, however,saidit would be wrong to lift the order, and so the superinjunction remained in place. This follows a path of the judiciary generally deferring to the state on matters of national security. However, this position can only be sustained when the state provides full and proper disclosure.The original motivation for the superinjunction was to protect vulnerable Afghans’ lives. What is certain is the leak of their details, at the very least, added to the risk they faced and it was right the government took action to protect them. But serious questions need to be asked about how the risk to them was examined throughout the years the superinjunction was in place – and whether withholding information from public scrutiny improved the situation of those involved.It is of note that the reason for the superinjunction no longer being extended was largely due to a Whitehall review conducted by Paul Rimmer, a former deputy chief of defence intelligence. In essence, Rimmer stated that a person’s presence on the leaked list was not a “defining factor” in determining risk to an individual, rather it was an element of the risk posed to Afghans who had assisted the UK. Once this report was provided to the court, keeping the superinjunction in place was simply unsustainable. As a consequence, judicial tolerance for the government’s position ran out.Afghans have been betrayed yet again by this shocking UK data leak – and many don’t even know if they’re affected | Diane TaylorRead moreGiven the content of the government’s own report, it could be argued that the state had a large part in bringing down its own superinjunction. Indeed, following Chamberlain’s provisional view on 1 July 2025 that the superinjunction should be lifted, the government legal department confirmed that the defence secretary,John Healey, had decided to discontinue the secret Afghan resettlement scheme and applied to discharge the injunction.It’s concerning then that the decision over whether or not this unprecedented superinjunction was necessary was, seemingly, up to the government. The public interest can only be defended by robust judicial analysis based on the state providing the court with a full account of information. The deference granted to the state on matters of national security is predicated on full and proper disclosure. However, in the context of seemingly flexible government opinion, it is questionable whether such deference is warranted if the primary factor in determining such applications can change so readily.This seems particularly true when superinjunctions as powerful as this one are exercised far past their sell-by date. If government opinion is a determining factor in applications such as these, one might reasonably question what happens if the government’s opinion does not change. Could extensive powers, similar to this superinjunction, continue indefinitely, denying the media the opportunity to properly scrutinise important decision-making relating to highly sensitive political matters?This unprecedented case raises the question of whether the state is being fair and above board in what it tells judges and whether there can be sufficient interrogation of the state’s position regarding matters of national security. A question it will only become more urgent that we answer.Theo Burges is a criminal barrister with a focus on national security laws at Red Lion Chambers, LondonExplore more on these topicsSuperinjunctionsOpinionAfghanistanMinistry of DefencecommentShareReuse this content"

I know novels aren’t manuals, but the Austen industry encourages a certain self-help approach to its products – and Austen herself was full of what we no longer call bossy opinions. From the books, there are endless shrewd judgments about how to be a woman of substance. From the screen adaptations, we learn just how nice it would be to have abig house in Derbyshire. There is the general rule of true love overcoming all obstacles. But there is also this: that there is no worse fate to befall a woman than to fail to lock down a man.Two new Austen adaptations are heading our way: a Netflix miniseries ofPride and Prejudice, and a newmovie version of Sense and Sensibility. They join Too Much,Lena Dunham’s new showthat riffs on our relationship with romcoms – how we use them as templates and ideals – a clear nod to Sleepless in Seattle, except withAng Lee’s Sense and Sensibilityas its urtext rather thanAn Affair to Remember.In Dunham’s show, Jessica, played by Megan Stalter, sits around with her family discussing the relative merits of Greg Wise v Alan Rickman while the 1995 movie airs in the background, ensuring that when the heroine moves to England, her experiences unfold in tension with what has come to be seen as Austen’s platonic ideal. It’s a meta-treatment of the genre, while the two forthcoming adaptations are typical period pieces; but while these projects differ, what remains curious, more than 200 years after Austen was writing, is that the underlying assumption remains the same: effectively, that there is no better story for a woman than one that ends in a marriage.Before I go further, I should say that, per the unwritten constitution of Britain – which mandates the holding of strong feelings about Austen by all citizens – I loved Lee’s Sense and Sensibility and have opinions about all the other adaptations that are the only correct opinions to have. For example, it hardly needs saying that Gwyneth Paltrow was terrible as Emma in the 1996 movie, and also that we have that particular adaptation to thank for the perfection of Sophie Thompson’s Miss Bates (specifically, the scene whereshe is insulted on Box Hill).As a Muslim girl in Bradford, I saw my story in Jane Austen’s novels. Now I’ve directed a TV series about her | Ali NaushahiRead moreIt is also true that romcoms, particularly Austen adaptations, hit you differently when you’re more interested in Jennifer Ehle than Colin Firth. There are no gays in Austen, obviously – although Mr Bingley is quite the fancy little gent and half of Austen’s women are cranky enough to have made excellent lesbians – but when you look at Austen from the point of view of someone not really implicated in the goals of the story, you see things slightly differently. That we still cleave to this model of marriage as a woman’s crowning achievement makes for excellent drama and who doesn’t love a love story? But at the risk of being the scowling lesbian at the feast, the sheer, centuries-long uniformity of the emphasis has a cost at the back end that we don’t really talk about.Which brings me to another TV show, one that examines, in brilliant, horrifying, anxiety-inducing detail, a strange side-effect of the assumptions underpinning the romcom. Fake is an Australian drama based on Stephanie Wood’s 2017viral piecein the Sydney Morning Herald that sheturned into a bestselling memoir, and in which Birdie Bell, her alter ego, falls in love with Joe, a man she meets on an online dating site. Wood/Bell dates him for over a year, during which time he presents himself as a brilliant businessman and property developer. It is only later, and after a series of sadistic deceptions, that Joe is revealed to be a lying grifter living under a piece of tarpaulin by a creek. And here’s the point: the reason the heroine ignores the red flags is because she is 49 years old and everyone – everyone – in her life is telling her, directly and otherwise, that she is defective until she gets married.I am not a straight woman but I found myself identifying hard with Birdie and, through her, Stephanie Wood, particularly on the subject of being uncomfortable at weddings. In Wood’s case, the experience was one of being made to feel like shit as the only single straight woman with no children; and for me and every gay person I know, there are memories of all those weddings we went to in the 1990s and early 2000s at which it never struck anyone present as remotely weird, or grotesque, that we were participating in an event from which we were legally barred. (Marriage, which entails hundreds of rights, privileges and financial benefits, becamelegal for same-sex couplesin 2014 in England and Wales, and a year later was legalised in the US by the supreme court.) Not very romantic, huh.None of this is Austen’s fault, or Dunham’s, and in fact I would say that Dunham’s engagement with romcom history is shot through with a sensibility I’d call gay-adjacent. (This in stark contrast to most writer/directors in the Austen film and TV space who – how to put this – are so straight they probably enjoy the window displays in Oliver Bonas.) Meanwhile, the greatest irony of all is that Austen, who remained unmarried, intended her novels to espouse a philosophy of only-marry-for-love, not marry-at-all-costs.Then, as now, that message buckles under a different value system, one that balances a woman’s worth on whether she has kids or is married. But as we look forward to a bunch more products driven by Regency-era values that are also our own, it’s worth remembering the flipside to the insistence that every good story ends with a wedding. In Wood’s case, the greater deception was not that she was taken in by a conman, but that, because of the excessive pressure on her to find a man, and in defiance of every instinct in her body telling her to run, she happened across a dangerous loser and – romcom-primed – conned herself into falling for him.Emma Brockes is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsWomenOpinionJane AustenLGBTQ+ rightsTelevisioncommentShareReuse this content"

Over to you, Merz and StarmerJohn KampfnerThe chancellor’s first London visit is an opportunity for a modernising reset – on business, defence and even school tripsThu 17 Jul 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 17 Jul 2025 16.33 EDTShareLook at the Germany shelf of your local British bookshop and, if one exists at all, it will almost certainly be filled with tomes about the Nazis and the two world wars. To write a book about contemporary Germany, to write anything complimentary – as I have done – is to buck the trend, even now, after all these years. And it still rankles. Many Germans still remember the infamous Mirror headline during the 1996 Euro football championships:Achtung! Surrender!Which is why today’s signing of thefirst UK-Germany friendship treaty, with defence and military cooperation at its heart, is so important. The accord is designed to smooth out post-Brexit problems, and forms the centrepiece of Friedrich Merz’s first visit to London as chancellor. The Germans will be happy that school trips to the UK will be made less tricky. Britons will be relieved that regular visitors, especially for business, may at some point be able to register for E-gate entry.From cybersecurity and digital links to green hydrogen and healthcare, both countries will seek ways of working together to improve resilience and modernise their economies. Some pledges are more concrete than others. So-called lighthouse projects, which promise to forge new links between the two nations, include a business forum, a youth summit, culture initiatives and a reannouncement of a direct train link betweenLondon and Cologne.As a first step, the symbolism matters most. The UK andGermany– perhaps the two countries most closely aligned when Britain was inside the EU – are starting out afresh in a darker world.Merz has still some way to go before completing his first 100 days in office, but he has already put his stamp on diplomacy. He has largely repairedrelations with France; he has made Germany a presence again in Brussels. Most of all, he has given his country heft inEuropean securitynot seen since the end of the cold war. His language on Russia is refreshingly blunt; his resolve to stand by Ukraine is hearteningly clear.He seesKeir Starmeras a key figure and has made a point of mentioning Britain whenever he can. Although Poland is also regarded as an important player, the old E3 grouping – Germany, France and the UK – is being restored.Merz, Starmer and Emmanuel Macron consult regularly on all the various flashpoints; before each of their pilgrimages to the Oval Office, they talked about the best way of dealing with Donald Trump. They still do. They all realise that Europe will have to defend itself. The new Nato commitment of 3.5% of GDP on direct military spending plus a further 1.5% on critical infrastructure is supposed to be sacrosanct. Germany has promised tohit the target by 2029; what isn’t clear is how quickly the other member states will get there.The immediate task is to keep the Americans present inEuropefor as long as possible, to extend the transition for as long as possible, and to coordinate as much as possible. It is here where the British can be most helpful.The strength of all these relationships will ultimately be based on day-to-day practical decision-making and not on formalities. Merz’s brief foray to London was never going to match the pageantry of Macron’s state visit last week, nor the fraught preparations already under way for Trump’s second such extravaganza to the UK in September.It’s important not to get carried away about a new era of E3 harmony. With Britain outside the EU and Starmer looking over his shoulder towards Nigel Farage at every turn, there is only so much Germany (and France) will be willing or able to do with the UK. All three leaders have an insecure hold on power as they face challenges from the hard right.Written off by someeven before he started, Merz is attacked within his own party for making concessions to his coalition partners, the Social Democrats, while his government is embroiled in its first big row, over appointments tothe constitutional court.Negotiations on this treaty were hamstrung both by the collapse of Olaf Scholz’s administration last autumn and by a constant suspicion on the German side of British grandstanding and what they see as a reluctance to do what it really takes to reset relations with the EU as a whole. Since Brexit, indeed long before Brexit, much of the bilateral conversation has been stuck in the past. German speakers at conferences seem to feel the need, 80 years on, to make some kind of reference to Churchill, to their own perfidy and to British bravery. The British hark on about the army on the Rhine and their role in the cold war.All the while, tens of thousands of Britons have moved to Germany in recent years, working in startups, biomedicine and the creative sector. The institutions and the political discourse do not speak to their lived experience.One of the tasks of the negotiators has been to future-proof the treaty, to insulate it from sudden political or economic lurches at home and abroad. They want it to last for a generation. It is a valiant aim. But given how little Starmer and Merz are in control of events, it is almost certainly a forlorn one.John Kampfner is the author of In Search of Berlin and Why the Germans Do It BetterExplore more on these topicsGermanyOpinionEuropeFriedrich MerzKeir StarmercommentShareReuse this content"

This is England’s great artificial water crisis of 2025George MonbiotIn its refusal to renationalise water, it’s clear the government operates in the interests of private capital and not of the countryThu 17 Jul 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 17 Jul 2025 08.04 EDTShareFor a rich and fairly stable country, we arestaggeringly ill-preparedfor climate shocks. We respond topredictable crisesas if we had had no warning. Lessons from previous disasters go unlearned, mistakes are recycled, failures lodged so deeply that they come to define the system.This is not because of a deficiency in the national character, but because of a deficiency in the ideology of government: an elite belief, shared by scarcely any citizens, that public intervention should be used only when all other measures have failed. Until that point, our problems should be addressed by the private sector. As droughtrolls across the countryonce again, England’s privatised water system guarantees an irrational response.Nothing undermines climate resilience in this country as much as the private ownership of our water system, and nothing reveals the drought of political ambition like the refusal to renationalise it. Once again we find ourselves confronting simultaneously both the climate crisis and the political crisis.Climate breakdown is the result of a global failure to address the power of private capital. Labour’s response to its impacts reflects the same timidity. As successive governments have stood and watched, we have been comprehensively rinsed by the water companies. The current administration seems prepared to go to any lengths not to break this pattern.Margaret Thatcher promised that water privatisation would deliver higher investment. But adetailed analysisby the public service union Unison found that, between 1990 and 2023, there was no net investment at all. “Investors” spent £3.6bn buying shares in 1989 and 1990, but by March 2023 total shareholder equity across the water sector amounted to £3.4bn. In real terms (taking inflation into account), that means a 60% reduction in shareholder capital.Over that period, shareholders managed to extract £77.6bn (in 2023 prices) in dividends from the water companies. Add this to the withdrawal of equity, and you discover that they have squeezed £82.4bn out of public assets. Much of this money was obtained through loading the companies with debt. Instead of borrowing to pay for infrastructure improvement, water companiesborrowed to payfor dividends. They knew that if the enterprise one day became insolvent as a result, it would be someone else’s problem. Ultimately,as we now discoverin the case of Thames Water, it becomes our problem. Just as the water companies dump their sewage in the rivers, they have also dumped their liabilities on the public. The country becomes their dustbin.Fixing England’s water isn’t just the right thing to do – it can be the start of Labour’s fightback | Clive LewisRead moreFor 36 years, these companies have acted as dispensers of free money to their owners,most of which are foreign, some of which are foreign states. In fact, the only government not permitted to own England’s water supply is the UK’s. They must see us as total suckers, giving away our national infrastructure, land and assets … for less than nothing.Any investments have been funded not by shareholders but by their customers, through our water bills. Theserose in the same periodby 360%, more than twice the general rate of inflation. The rise has since accelerated. Every year, we pay £2.3bnmore for our waterand sewerage bills than we would if the suppliers were publicly owned, according to research by the University of Greenwich. High bills, impossible debts, filthy rivers, minimal investment and no resilience: that is the gift of privatisation.One of the results of this asset-stripping model is that leakage rates remain disgracefully high. While thehosepipe bansnow being introducedaround the nationare likely to save between 3% and 7% of the water we would otherwise use, 19% of the water piped through the network islost through leakage. Compare this with the publicly owned Dutch system,which loses 4%. For the same reason, no major reservoirhas been completedhere since 1992.Demand management has beenjust as hopeless, with the result that, without further action, waterdemand will exceed supplyby 2034. Given that their profits from metered customers depend on the amount we use, the water companies have a powerful incentive not to address the problem. Instead, as supplies become critically low, they insist that they must be allowed toextract even morefrom our rivers and aquifers, with dire impacts on wildlife and water quality.For similar reasons, theyresist imposing hosepipe bansuntil the last possible moment. It seems crazy that this decision should be left to the water companies, with their perverse incentives and conflicts of interest, rather than being taken by public bodies; but this is yet another outcome of the public-bad, private-good elite ideology. Even senior Tory MPsexpressed frustrationthat government could not simply decide what needed to be done; but that’s the system they built, working as designed.As for the regulators, they too are useless by design. Ofwat, which is meant to protect the public interest, has succumbed to full-scale regulatory capture, assenior staff circulatebetween the water companies and the agency supposed to hold them to account. The Environment Agency, chronically underfunded and demotivated,almost halvedits water use inspections in the five years to 2023: a classic example of deregulation by stealth. The rules might remain on the statute book, but without monitoring and enforcement they might as well have been deleted.Throughout its history, water privatisation in the UK has been deeply unpopular. In 1986, a year after Thatcher proposed the policy,a poll showed71% opposed and only 21% in favour. Since then, opposition has only hardened: a poll a year ago revealed thatonly 8% of people believedwater should still be run by the private sector, while 82% wanted to see it renationalised. But two months later, the governmentruled this out. Why? Because, according to the environment secretary, Steve Reed, it would cost too much.Really? Aseries of analysesshow that the government could renationalise these companies fornext to nothing, not least because their real value isless than zero. There would be some administrative costs, but these are likely to be far smaller than the annual expense of sustaining the current system.It’s a simple test: does the government operate in the interests of the country, or in the interests of private capital? This shouldn’t be a difficult choice for Labour to make, yet, as with so many such tests, it flunks it. Why? Because it is terrified of any measure that might alienate even the most parasitic and extractive forms of capital. Strangely, however, it seems to have no qualms about alienating the rest of us.George Monbiot is a Guardian columnistOn Tuesday 16 September, join George Monbiot, Mikaela Loach and other special guests discussing the forces driving climate denialism, live at the Barbican in London and livestreamed globally.

The bright day turned to dark in the time it took.Now, the playground near the site in Tuam has been dismantled and the long-awaitedexhumation has begun. But why has it taken more than a decade since it emerged that those dead children were likely buried in sewage chambers on the grounds of a publicly funded institution run by nuns and the local council?A technical drawing from the 1970s of the council housing estate built on the grounds showed “old children’s burial ground” written directly above “proposed playground”. Local authorities knew long ago.News first broke in 2014 afterCatherine Corless, who was working on a history project, tracked down death certificates for nearly 800 children for whom there were almost no burial records. She had gone to the Bon Secours Sisters, the Catholic organisation that ran the home, to the local bishop and the authorities. Little was done until she went to the media.It is a vindication of Corless’s work that the exhumation is taking place, but also disturbing that it was never a certainty.I had already started writing a book about survivors of Ireland’s institutions for “unmarried mothers” when a test excavation publicly confirmed “significant human remains” at Tuam, dating to the time the nuns ran the home, between 1925 and1961. In 2018, the public was asked what should be done. I keep thinking of the “talking stone”, a lump of grey felt handed around a public meeting organised by Galway county council, which owned the site, in a Tuam hotel. We were asked to hold it and say what we wanted to happen about a mass grave of babies. Options ranged from memorialisation alone to the full forensic excavation happening today. While it was important to talk about it, it also felt surreal and even wrong, with some people asking why the site was not being treated as any other crime scene.One man described Tuam as “ground zero” and begged: “Dig those bodies up, every one of them, all over the country. Give the children some dignity.” Even if one family was able to get an answer, it was worth it. A woman from the housing estate pointed out that she had “no right to tell a survivor you cannot identify where your brother or sister is” and hoped the children would not be left “in a cesspit with just a plaque”.It was survivors, families and all those who wanted the truth for them who fought relentlessly against an ongoing silence from church and state. It was activists such as Izzy Kamikaze, who found an old map showing cesspools in the grounds that wereknown locally to have included a burial site. Bones had been found sporadically down the years.As the former Irish president Mary McAleese said about systemic abuse: “We heard it through the media, we heard it through the courage of victims, we heard it through lawyers, we heard it through government. We never really heard it openly, spontaneously from our church.”I would say we never heard it first from those in power either, even when, in the case of the Tuam children, they hadaccess to the informationlong before, from earlier investigations.View image in fullscreenCatherine Corless in 2014, when she found the death certificates of the children who had died at the Tuam institution.Photograph: Patrick Bolger/Patrick Bolger PhotogrraphyAt a council meeting in the 1960s, an influential politician argued against the impending closure of Tuam, saying, “The county has the benefit of the money spent there.” I reported how aTuam survivor fosteredby the same politician spoke of abuse and exploitation for labour. She died before seeing any justice.“Our Lord was crucified and so were the women of this country,” PJ Haverty, a Tuam survivor who first took me to the burial site, told me. “The nuns had power, it was all about money and it was all about power.” His mother had gone to the nuns day after day trying to get her baby back.Tuam was just one in a system of institutions that operated until as recently as 2006, where unmarried pregnant women were sent to give birth, were effectively incarcerated and, in many cases, were forcibly separated from their children: more than 50,000 mothers and more than 50,000 children. Acommission of investigation, forced by the news of Tuam, began in 2015 and concluded in 2021, finding that 9,000 children had died in these “homes”. But it called the institutions “refuges” and dismissed survivor testimonies about the inhumanity and abuses. Theofficial redress schemenow excludesthousands of survivors, seemingly to cut costs.In 2018, during the government press conference announcing the decision to excavate, I was told by the then children’s minister Katherine Zappone thatTuam could set a precedent for other institutions. There are many families still searching for answers. There are also mass graves on the grounds of similar institutions in the UK, the US and Canada. The crimes of the Catholic church are global.At the memorial last year, Tuam survivorPeter Mulryantold me he didn’t want to sign the legal waiver required for redress, under which recipients agree not to take any further action against the state about their experience, so preventing any legal justice, describing it as “another insult to survivors”. But, at 81, he felt he had no choice and is happy others aretaking the case to court. Mulryan was one of many Tuam children “boarded out” to a farm, and he told me he was brutally exploited there, with no justice or redress.His mother was sent to the Galway Magdalene laundry for the rest of her life. Corless found a sister he never knew about, who had died at Tuam. He hasspoken outfor most of a decade, hoping to find her.View image in fullscreenPeter Mulryan is a survivor of the Bon Secours mother-and-baby home in Tuam.Photograph: Charles McQuillan/Getty ImagesReligious sisters did speak to me for my book, but were often silenced by superiors or after legal advice. Meanwhile, voices fromwithin the religious right, including the president of the Catholic League in the US, have called Tuam “a hoax”, in a country where reproductive rights are rolled back and Catholic hospitals have increasing influence. The Bon Secours order is part of an international healthcare conglomerate worth billions in the US.Terry Prone, whose PR firm acted for the Bon Secours Sisters, wrote anow infamous emailwhen the news first broke, calling it the “O my God – mass grave in West of Ireland” story and warning a French TV journalist: “You’ll find no mass grave, no evidence that children were ever so buried.”Ireland’s mother-and-baby homes are a stain on the Catholic church - but this latest refusal to atone is a new low | Rhiannon Lucy CosslettRead moreAt a reading of my book, a man repeated the hoax claim, even after public photos from the test excavation showed the slits in a huge tank, making any proper burial impossible, the blurred photos of infant bones inside, and a baby’s blue shoe. Despite this, religious and political conservatives in Ireland, rallying against recent progressive changes, have even argued for bringing backsuch institutions.From the earliest years, the state knew that “illegitimate” children in these institutions were dying at sometimes five times the rate of children born within marriage. Death certificates show children dying of malnutrition, or marked as “imbecile”, one boy convulsing for 12 hours before dying. The children’s lives were not valued.I think of Julia Devaney, a domestic worker in Tuam, whodescribed it in taped interviewsas barracks-like, smelling of the wet beds of frightened and deprived children, while nuns treated officials from local authorities to lavish dinners on the grounds. Devaney said a nun who worked there left the Bon Secours because of what she saw. “They knew well that the home was a queer place, ’twas a rotten place,” said Devaney. “I feel a sense of shame that I did not create a war.”Survivors are still fighting their long battle for truth and justice, hoping similar injustices will never be repeated. I believe that even today church and state perpetuate the silences and inequalities that led to a mass grave of children. This excavation can be a reckoning, a reminder to those in power to listen to those who are owed real accountability: the survivors and the families of the many children who can no longer speak.Caelainn Hogan is an Irish journalist and the author of Republic of ShameDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

That wasn’t how it panned out, but Ice Moon, the single from her second EP, S, is evidence of where she once seemed to be headed: a poppy, but distinctly psychedelic swirl of blissful vocals and electronics.View image in fullscreenSZA in 2013.18. Prom (2017)Prom might be the most overlooked track on SZA’s debut album. Another painfully drawn saga of insecurity, it’s equipped with a fabulous, incongruously buoyant melody, set to music that underlines the breadth and diversity of SZA’s vision: the clipped beat and guitar owes as much to alt-rock as R&B.17. Time Travel Undone (2012)Her debut EP, See.SZA.Run, has evaded streaming services, but it’s worth seeking out: different to the music that made SZA famous but still great.

TwoAM (2016)A smart take on PartyNextDoor’s hit Come and See Me: SZA takes on the role of the woman on the receiving end of the original’s booty call, slowly realising that her suitor’s only after one thing. It revealed a more straightforward and earthy SZA, but was curiously dropped from the tracklisting of CTRL.15. Terror.Dome (2013)More fabulous left-field arcana from SZA’s early years: Terror.Dome opens with a chunk of dialogue from horror movie Rosemary’s Baby, the perfect complement to the eerie, echo-drenched sound of what follows: sparse synths, booming drums, cooing vocals at odds with the lyrics, in which infatuation has clearly turned to worrying obsession.View image in fullscreenSZA during her Glastonbury festival headlining slot in 2024.Photograph: Joel C Ryan/Invision/AP14. Sweet November (2014)Signed up by Top Dawg Entertainment – the label that gave the world Kendrick Lamar – SZA scored her first hit with Child’s Play, a Chance the Rapper collab from her EP Z. But its real stand out is the deep cut Sweet November: a dreamy delight that samples aMarvin Gaye obscurity.13. Joni ft Don Toliver (2025)Joni had a tortuous gestation: SZA leaked a version online in 2020, fans leaked another in 2023, prompting SZA to announce she wouldn’t release it officially. She changed her mind: a good thing, given how utterly lovely its Joni Mitchell-inspired melody and sample of the late Elliott Smith’s guitar playing sound.12. 20 Something (2017)20 Something draws CTRL to a sombre, soul-bearing conclusion driven by acoustic guitar: SZA’s life’s a mess, she’s alone, fearful of adult responsibilities that she doesn’t feel ready to accept, a situation to which, evidently, millions of fans could relate. It ends, winningly, with a faintly exasperated pep talk from her mum.View image in fullscreenSZA at the Billboard music awards, Los Angeles, 2021.Photograph: Rob Latour/Shutterstock11. Good Days (2020)The first single from SOS suggested things hadn’t improved much emotionally in SZA’s world: the line about “trying to get my mind together before the end of the world” struck a particularly resonant note on release, in the midst of the pandemic. The sparkling, summery prettiness of the music somehow amplifies the gloom.10. Saturn (2024)The deluxe version of SOS, Lana, appended an entire album’s worth of new material to the original: quite why it wasn’t released as an album in its own right is a mystery when the new songs were as good as Saturn, a shimmering ballad that’s the match of anything on the original album.9. Garden (Say It Like Dat) (2017)The brilliance of Garden lies in the tension between the music – trap drums beneath a haze of electronics and vocal samples spiked with euphorically bubbling electronic tones – and the rawness of SZA’s vocal and the emotions it draws: yearning and pleading for emotional reassurance and commitment amid a burst of insecurity.8. I Hate U (2021)One of several songs on SOS in which SZA makes no bones about how aggrieved she feels after a breakup, I Hate U sets its 4am drunk-dialling despair and bile – “It’s shitty of you to make me feel like this!” – to a superb musical backdrop made of equal parts murky lo-fi R&B and smooth yacht rock.7. Snooze (2022)SZA: Snooze – videoSnooze came in two, equally great versions – the original is classic R&B that would have been a hit at any point in the last 30 years (“aunties approve of its authenticity,” as one critic put it); the acoustic version is woozily dreamy and features Justin Bieber. Both are poignant, confessional and softly powerful.6. Kendrick Lamar – All the Stars ft SZA (2018)Just a guest appearance, but let’s bend the rules a little: this surprisingly slick contribution to the Black Panther soundtrack is worth it. It’s theoretically Kendrick’s show, but it gifts SZA an absolute monster of a chorus, which she totally nails: they feel like equal partners, which is quite some feat.5. Drew Barrymore (2017)The point which you might suggest SZA as we now know her came into being, Drew Barrymore is direct, relatable and witty – “with her mom jeans and her new Vans, she’s perfect and I hate her” – and musically striking: spare beats, twanging guitar. The titular movie star was apparently impressed.4. Nobody Gets Me (2022)Performed live while SZA soared above the audience in a boat (!), Nobody Gets Me takes an intriguing route to anthemic ballad territory: it’s alternately crestfallen, raunchy, intimate and subject to some spectacular vocal pyrotechnics. The chorus is key: it’s got a definite slice of Natalie Imbruglia’s Torn in its DNA, but itreallyworks.3. The Weekend (2017)SZA: The Weekend – videoClassic cheating soul – “my man is your man … you like 9 to 5, I’m the weekend” – retooled for today: slow beats, soft synths, a sample from Justin Timberlake’s Set the Mood (Prelude). Calvin Harris’s excellent remix, meanwhile, recasts it as mid-tempo disco. Both versions are great – take your pick.Mud, mess and murder ballads: SZA’s massive success shows that pop fans are craving realness | Shaad D'SouzaRead more2. Kill Bill (2022)Wikipedia describes 2023’s third biggest-selling single as a murder ballad. It is, although that doesn’t capture how engagingly witty its fantasies of offing an ex are – she follows him “at the farmer’s market, with your perfect peach” – amplified by the pure pop sweetness of its chorus.1. Broken Clocks (2017)If you had to pick a song that summed up SZA’s multi-platinum appeal, Broken Clocks would be it. The lyrics exemplify her brand of confessional, no-filter intensity, depicting a life on the brink of chaos: still haunted by the memory of an ex from years ago, not even she can work out how she feels. The music blends R&B classicism with trap beats and a distinct note of chillwave-derived fogginess. Her voice feels powerful and natural: it has an unaffected, almost conversational quality, as if she’s confiding in the listener. And the chorus is superb, built for an audience who know how she feels to howl along to.SZA’s best songs – playlistSpotifyExplore more on these topicsRankedSZAKendrick LamarChance the RapperRapfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I was a young mother and I had my career. I wanted to talk to other female actors who were balancing their life with their art. That’s kind of the exploration of the documentary: how do we do it all? Something always seems to take the back seat. For me, it was hard to put motherhood in the back seat. I remember my daughter’s third birthday. I was supposed to have the day off, but we overshot filming, so I wasn’t going to be able to fly home from Vancouver and I was absolutely devastated.I thought: “This is the most horrible thing. I’m gonna miss my daughter’s birthday. It’s not worth being an actress.” But then her dad flew her up to surprise me. It got me thinking: how do you make sure your marriage doesn’t take a back seat to your career? It reminds me of Michael Powell’s The Red Shoes, where she can’t make that decision between choosing her life or her art, and she ends up dancing in front of a train. So I think I was just exploring that with other women, asking them how they do it, and it ended up being a really great conversation. I’d like to revisit it now.

The grey-haired patient urges her psychiatrist for a hug, a cuddle – that, she says, is all she needs to keep at bay the nightmarish visions that haunt her. Yet on her ward at the Esquirol hospital centre inParis, such simple gestures are impossible to come by. “When I asked for a hug,” Laurence laments, “they gave me a jar of yoghurt.”‘I’d be a wreck without it’: the floating daycare centre where Parisians paint, dance and healRead moreThis scene, from Nicolas Philibert’s new documentary At Averroès & Rosa Parks (two sections of the Esquirol hospital centre), is as hard to watch as anything you are likely to see on a cinema screen this year. But it is especially remarkable coming from perhaps theworld’s pre-eminent maker of humanist documentaries. The Frenchman Philibert is one of modern cinema’s great champions of kindness. Aged 74, he has built a career making award-winning observational portraits of places that excel at giving care within a hostile modern world: a southern French school for hearing-impaired people in 1992’s In the Land of the Deaf; museums and the people who dedicate their lives to maintaining the objects inside them in Louvre City (1990) and Animals and More Animals (1995); a single-teacher infant school in the rural Auvergne region in Être et Avoir, his 2001 international breakthrough film.On the Adamant, his 2023 Golden Bear-winning doc about anoccupational therapy centremoored on the river Seine, was Philibertismpar excellence: a film about a place that heals because it lives up to the simple ideal of treating patients as people. Yet its follow-up – which explores where some of the Adamant’s passengers go on their bad days –is a film about a place where healing never seems to take place.“[For] On the Adamant, I filmed a lot of workshops and group meetings,” Philibert says on a video call from Paris. “In At Averroès & Rosa Parks, the atmosphere and architecture is more severe, the space is more constraining. When the patients are in the hospital, they are more vulnerable, they are more in pain, they are overwhelmed by anxieties. Life is a hell. Everyone is locked in their solitude.”View image in fullscreenSevere architecture … At Averroès & Rosa Parks.Photograph: TCD/Prod.DB/AlamyThe film about the floating daycare centre became a crowdpleaser because it managed to portray a potentially forlorn place as something more akin to an elite institution for outsider artists (its name, riffing on that of the English post-punk singer who has been open about his bipolar disorder, is no coincidence). But during the filming Philibert realised: “If I didn’t show that the patients circulate between the boat and less prestigious structures, I wouldn’t be showing reality.” The result is what he calls a “triptych” of three films shot over a 12-month period between April 2021 and 2022, screening for the first time in their entirety in the UK at London’s Bertha DocHouse cinema next weekend.The third of the three films, The Typewriter and Other Headaches (Philibert says they can be watched in any order), is still infused with its director’s typical humanism: following the Adamant’s carers as they visit their patients at home to repair broken typewriters, printers and record players, it shows how broken machines and severed links to the outside world can be fixed.And if we do not see any repair work in At Averroès & Rosa Parks, it’s not for the carers’ lack of trying. Made up entirely of conversations between mental health patients and their psychiatrists, it shows the hospital’s staff display extraordinary empathy in their handling of people with severe conditions. We hear them engage respectfully with Olivier, who is confused about family relations and tells his carers that other people’s daughters are his, and that his grandfather is present at the hospital in the shape of other patients. We see them listen patiently to Noé, who speaks multiple languages, makes art, practises Buddhism, teaches philosophy, but also suffers from “megalomania”, a condition he believes was brought on by swallowing a handful of acid at a trance festival as a teenager.But there is always a lurking sense that these conversations are under strain. One patient, Pascal, tells his carer that great psychiatrists are like Kylian Mbappé, the French footballer known for his clinical finishing: “They get to the point, they sense things.” But when he lists the names of psychiatrists he considers top of his league, he pointedly omits to mention the woman he is talking to, and then phases out of the conversation completely. Laurence’s psychiatrist goes to extreme lengths to assuage her fear that the carers are out to harm her and steal her cigarettes, but she snaps back: “I don’t trust you, I stopped trusting you ages ago. You’re dumb, you’re dumb as shit.” He doesn’t retaliate – there’s a camera rolling, after all – but can’t quite stop the hurt pride from showing on his face.“I really wanted for this second film to be based almost entirely on speech and listening, because these are two things that almost becoming extinct in the psychiatric world,” says Philibert. “Public hospitals inFranceand elsewhere are becoming abandoned by public power. It translates as a deep lack of means, a deep lack of attractiveness. A lot of nurses who work in psychiatry end up leaving because they can carry out their work with dignity less and less.”View image in fullscreenTreating patients as people … On the Adamant.Photograph: © TS Production / LongrideAt the end of the film,we meet Laurence again. Her flowing locks have been trimmed short, and she has bloodied plasters on her fingers and festering burns on her face. In a moment of desperation, we learn, she set herself on fire. I wonder if that last scene comes close to violating one of the principles Philibert’s previous films adhered to: for all his interest in people with mental troubles, he usually goes to some lengths to avoid showing them in their troubled state. Yet his depiction of Laurence could be seen to be using her pain for dramatic effect.Philibert is quick to reassert his ethical guidelines. “My films rest on trust,” he says, adding: “Even if a patient or a carer signs a written authorisation, it doesn’t mean that you’re immune or that legal pursuit isn’t possible if you tarnish the image of a person.” He’s speaking from experience: after Être et Avoir became a breakout hit, the teacher at the heart of the film(unsuccessfully) tried to sue Philibert for a share of the profits, claiming that the film’s success rested entirely on his personality.In Laurence’s case, Philibert insists that she gave her consent before and after the filming, because she perceived his request “a proof of consideration”. “‘You want to film me? Oh, you’re interested in me. Me who is always sidelined, rejected, made invisible.’”Still, it’s fascinating to watch a film-maker discover new emotional timbres in his 70s. When the screen cuts to black at the end, and a jazz-guitar version of Beethoven’s Ode to Joy plays over the credits, it feels like we are encountering a very unlikely emotion for a Philibert film: bitterness. And perhaps he is also allowing his beliefs to shine through more than previously. In the film’s opening scene, when staff and patients watch drone footage of the hospital, Noé comments: “It’s scary, it’s like a prison.” Philibert is fond of quoting his fellow documentarian Frederick Wiseman’s maxim: “If you need to drive home a message, send an email but don’t make a film,” but what is this if not a pointed message about the state of modern French psychiatry?“You know, the world of psychiatry is the realm of the unexpected,” he says. “When you enter, all your certainties are shattered. The madmen reset all your counters to zero. They push you to revise all your diagrams.”On the Adamant, The Typewriter and Other Headaches and At Averroès & Rosa Parks are showing at Bertha DocHouse 26-27 JulyExplore more on these topicsNicolas PhilibertDocumentary filmsFranceMental healthPsychiatryParisEuropeinterviewsShareReuse this content"

The cast have American accents and could be high-schoolers clicking their fingers, despite the period dress. The drama archly positions club-land beats and contemporary phraseology (“cool”, “totally” “my social anxiety …”) alongside choral sounds and medieval monasticism. It is light on historical detail, heavy on humour and attitude.So it makes sense to cast two Netflix stars in this very modern spin on the Italian saints: Clare is played by Arsema Thomas, known for her TV role inQueen Charlotte(the Bridgerton spin-off) while Shadow and Bone actor, Freddy Carter, is the priggishly earnest Francis.Atik’s play, which won multiple awards in America, dramatises the conversion of Clare, an Italian noblewoman inspired by her friendship with Francis of Assisi to found an order following a rule of strict poverty. Here she is as kick-ass as they come, with an immaculate stage debut from Thomas, who plays the part straight up and sharp, despite the eyebrow-raised wit of the enterprise.View image in fullscreenPriggishly earnest … Freddy Carter as Francis of Assisi in Poor Clare.Photograph: Ellie KurttzBut beneath the surface glibness there is lean, clever writing with short, sharp scenes and clean direction by Blanche McIntyre as the play travels towards its serious preoccupations with wealth, poverty and inequality.Clare, with her order of Poor Ladies, was anything but poor at the outset. She renounced all her wealth after meeting Francis and embraced radical poverty (her order, until recently, were still instructed to walk barefoot). Francis, meanwhile, is mocked, gently, as a young man rebelling against his silk merchant father. He slowly becomes more moderate, it seems, and Clare all the more radical.The unfussy, single statement set (a bed, a chair, a bare tiled floor) is designed by Eleanor Bull, who also dreams up some gorgeously regal period costumes. It is suffused in warm, pointed light by Oliver Fenwick.There are some great scenes of bristling sisterhood between Clare and younger sis, Beatrice (Anushka Chakravarti, cutely brattish), as well as gossiping sessions between Clare and her two lady’s maids (Liz Kettle and Jacoba Williams).“Can you spare any change, please?” says a beggar who Clare and Beatrice mistake for a heap of rubbish. This hammers home the fact that this is both about 13th-century poverty and our own. But there is potency in the heavy-handedness: the play is not trying to hide the fact that inequality then is recognisable, and unchanged, today.There are intelligent conversations about it that resonates loudly for today – Francis speaks of how the rich must necessarily turn a blind eye to poverty because it implicates them, by its existence.The ending speaks of the modern world and all the ways in which the gulf between rich and poor is shored up. It should jar but instead leaves you prickled, roused, impressed by the singularity of Clare’s resolve – and awkwardly implicated yourself.AtOrange Tree theatre, London, until 9 AugustExplore more on these topicsTheatreComedyReligionreviewsShareReuse this content"

The tone, as you might expect from a goofball superhero movie that is plainly about the invasion of Gaza, is all over the shop. Too many characters contribute too little to the plot. There are moments when it feels like it was written specifically to provide work for the silly-glasses and ironic-haircut industries. It is a bit of a mess.Puppy power: canine in new Superman movie spurs pet adoption interestRead moreBut that said, one thing is demonstrably true: the dog is cool. As shown in the trailer, Krypto the superdog is Superman’s secret weapon. A mile away from his last screen outing, where he was muscular and proud and voiced by Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, Superman’s Krypto is scrappy and wild. He doesn’t obey commands. He destroys whatever equipment is put in front of him. Whenever he may or may not save the day, it seems like he does it out of accident rather than design.And now everybody wants one. Research by the dog training app Woofz has shown that Google searches for “adopt a dog near me”jumped 513% during Superman’s opening weekend. What’s more, searches for “rescue dog adoption near me” rose by 163%, while “adopt a puppy” rose by 31%. And these searches are specific, too. Krypto is apparently a schnauzer-terrier mix, and “adopt a schnauzer” searches have risen by almost 300% since Superman’s release.There are many potential reasons for this. Perhaps viewers who found themselves confused by Superman’s swampy storytelling latched on to Krypto as a guidepoint. Perhaps they have short attention spans and fail to think things through, as with the boom of dalmatian sales (and subsequent boom in dalmatian abandonments)after 101 Dalmatians was released in 1996. Or perhaps it’s because Superman is one of the rare films to get dog ownership exactly right.View image in fullscreenNot entirely realistic … Marley & Me.Photograph: REX/c.20th Century Fox/EverettSo often in Hollywood, dogs are either loyal companions or would-be therapists who teach their owners about the meaning of love. Think of Marley and Me, in which a dog helps Owen Wilson to love and then dies. Or Turner and Hooch, in which a dog helps Tom Hanks to love and then gets murdered. Or Old Yeller, in which a dog helps a boy to love and then the boy shoots it with a shotgun. Some mix the formula up a little – in The Call of the Wild a dog teaches Harrison Ford to love, and then Harrison Ford dies – but you get the gist.Meanwhile, Krypto is a bit of a dick. The first time we meet him, Superman has been beaten for the very first time. Bleeding and broken, as a last resort he calls on his faithful pup to help him to safety. In any other film, this is exactly what Krypto would have done. But here he leaps all over Superman instead, doing little but compounding his injuries. He’s excited. He wants to help. But he’s also a dog, so he’s sort of useless.Winningly, there’s no sentimental ending to his story, either. He doesn’t ever really bond with Superman, and he definitely doesn’t die. In the end (and this probably counts as a spoiler), Supergirl comes and picks him up, and Superman barely even notices. There’s no growth. Nobody learns anything. It’s sort of great.It’s telling that Krypto was only written into the script after James Gunn adopted a dog of his own, named Ozu. Last year on Twitter, Gunn wrote that “Ozu, who came from a hoarding situation in a backyard with 60 other dogs and never knew human beings, was problematic to say the least. He immediately came in and destroyed our home, our shoes, our furniture – he even ate my laptop. It took a long time before he would even let us touch him. I remember thinking, ‘Gosh, how difficult would life be if Ozu had superpowers?’ – and thus Krypto came into the script.”And maybe that’s the key here. There were no misty-eyed Marley and Me-style reminiscences about Ozu. Gunn was living through the incredibly annoying part of dog ownership where neither party fully trusts the other, and just lifted it wholesale into the script. And this realistic depiction has apparently translated to the hearts of Superman’s audience, as we will soon see when thousands of schnauzers are definitely not abandoned at shelters four months from now.Explore more on these topicsFilmSupermanFamily filmsFamilyPetsDogsAnimalsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The Millet masterpiece that electrified modern artVan Gogh saw compassion for the rural worker; Dalí saw phalluses and a child’s grave. As The Angelus comes to the UK, our critic celebrates a painting so deep it could even induce hallucinationsJonathan JonesThu 17 Jul 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 17 Jul 2025 03.54 EDTShareIt wasSalvador Dalíwho turned a small, intense rural scene called The Angelus, painted by Jean-François Millet in 1857-59 and hugely popular in its day, into a totem of modern art.In the original, a pious peasant couple have heard the Angelus bell from a distant church, the Catholic call to prayer, and paused their work digging potatoes to lower their heads and pray. But from Dalí’s writings, we know he saw far more in the painting, from obscene sex to family tragedy. In one of his many versions of it, Atavism at Twilight, the couple sprout agricultural implements from their bodies. In his surreal drawings these good country people become mouldering, mummified husks, or are transformed into fossils by time and sadness. Now that the original painting is being lent by the Musée d’Orsay to theNational Galleryas the star of its forthcoming show Millet: Life on the Land, we will all get a chance to obsess over this innocent-seeming artwork.The Angelus was an instant hit in the 1800s, widely reproduced, while the original passed through a string of private collections for record prices until the Louvre, which first tried to buy it for France in 1889, acquired it in 1910. In 1932 it received perhaps the ultimate fan homage: it was attacked – slashed several times with a penknife. After being repaired, it remained in the Louvre until the Orsay opened in 1986.At an exhibition of Millet’s drawings, Van Gogh told himself: ‘Take off your shoes, for where you are standing is holy ground’Decades ahead of Dalí, Van Gogh also copied it in a fervent 1880 drawing that was one of his first artistic efforts – its untrained clumsiness makes the emotion even more touching. He revered The Angelus as his ideal model of all that art should be and do. In their fascination with Millet’s masterpiece, both these modernist giants show how a work of art can turn into something else in the beholder’s mind. Dalí deliberately induced a state akin to illness in his mind in order to hallucinate upon The Angelus. “The only difference between me and a madman is that I am not mad,” he said. Van Gogh was of course less able to switch it on and off.View image in fullscreen‘His ideal model of all that art should be and do’ … Van Gogh’s 1880 drawing The Angelus (after Millet).Photograph: AlamyVan Gogh was in London, working at the Covent Garden branch of the art dealer Goupil et Fils, when he wrote about its power in one of his earliest letters. “That painting by Millet, L’angelus du soir,” he told his brother Theo in 1874, “that’s it, indeed – that’s magnificent, that’s poetry.” At the age of just 21, five years before he decided to become a painter, the Dutch pastor’s son saw something uniquely poetic in The Angelus.Its creator, Jean-François Millet, was then near the end of his life. Like Bruegel centuries before him, Millet painted rural life so authentically that people thought he was a peasant sharing his world. This was not entirely groundless: he was born into a farming family from Grouchy, near the Channel coast in Normandy. Millet said The Angelus depicted a memory of this childhood: “The idea came to me because I remembered that my grandmother, hearing the church bell ringing while we were working in the fields, always made us stop work to say the Angelus prayer for the poor departed.”Millet was not a naive artist. He trained in Paris with the history painter Paul Delaroche, famed forThe Execution of Lady Jane Grey(1833). But things didn’t go well and he retreated to Cherbourg. He seemed stuck in a career as a local portrait painter.Then, suddenly, he found himself. Millet started painting the hard life of the peasantry. It was a political decision. He had his first hit with The Winnower, a painting of a man shaking a basket of grain, throwing golden specks high in the air so when they fall the wheat will be separated from the chaff. Does that sound allegorical? It surely is, for Millet unveiled this image of a peasant weeding out corrupt bad seeds at the Paris Salon in 1848,the year revolutions convulsed Europe. The paintings that followed are monuments to backbreaking rural work: The Sower; The Gleaners. Millet doesn’t paint the landscape as an idyll but a place where the poor are worked to death.Van Gogh saw Millet’s compassion through a religious lens. Soon after that early letter to Theo he was sacked and, after a spell teaching, tried to become a preacher and missionary to the poor. His family thought he had a religious mania. His fervour included worshipping Millet. When he saw an exhibition of Millet’s drawings, he raved, “I felt like telling myself, take off your shoes, for the place where you are standing is holy ground.”View image in fullscreenThe next chapter … Van Gogh’s Potato Eaters (1885).Photograph: Granger/Historical Picture Archive/AlamyVan Gogh’s debt to Millet is obvious in his early work. In his 1885 drawing Peasant Woman Digging, he gives the digger massive, earthy presence – like Millet’s folk. But his most blatant reference to The Angelus is The Potato Eaters.In Millet’s Angelus, the peasants have taken a break from their arduous toil digging potatoes from the hard earth: we see spuds in their basket and in a bulging sack in their wheelbarrow. Van Gogh’s The Potato Eaters feels like the next chapter. The peasants have gone home to share a humble meal with their family. Van Gogh stakes his claim here to succeed Millet as a peasant painter.But did Van Gogh respond so intensely to The Angelus for reasons that were harder to name than politics or religion? A surrealist would say yes. Dalí would see unnameable insinuations in The Angelus – and being Dalí, name them.For him, this painting was “the most troubling, the most enigmatic, the densest, the richest in unconscious thoughts that has ever been.” Seen through his eyes, The Angelus is less a slice of rustic life, more a kitsch surrealist dreamwork.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toArt WeeklyFree weekly newsletterYour weekly art world round-up, sketching out all the biggest stories, scandals and exhibitionsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The brown lumps of potatoes in the basket look turd-like while the shapeless sack might contain part of a body. The three prongs of the huge fork have been driven into the ground with unwonted violence. If that doesn’t seem phallic enough, the two thick hafts of the wheelbarrow poke from the woman’s skirts. Do these Freudian intimations point to something unspeakable in the figures’ relationship? In Dalí’s Atavism at Twilight, the fork is stuck in the woman’s back: the man dreams of sodomising her. She’s his mum, according to Dalí.View image in fullscreenFreudian intimations … Dalí’s Atavism at Twilight (Obsessional Phenomenon), after The Angelus (1933).Photograph: © 2025 Salvador Dali, Fundació Gala-Salvador Dalí, DACSAlternatively, he suggested, they are the parents of a dead child. Dalí believed that Millet had originally painted a grave in the foreground. You can sort of see it. He persuaded the Louvre to X-ray it and claimed the results confirmed his theory. It haunts his eerie 1965 painting The Perpignan Station, in which the grave becomes a railway track dividing the Angelus couple. Perpignan, the first station in France coming from Spain, and where papers were checked, becomes here a liminal place between life and death.Dalí had enough ideas about The Angelus to fill a book, and they did. He penned The Tragic Myth of Millet’s Angelus in the 1930s, and published it three decades later. It has been hailed as the most ambitious theorisation of what he called his “paranoiac-critical method” in which you hallucinate layers and metamorphoses of an object or image. Did he mean a word of it? Was he really obsessed with The Angelus or did he just enjoy the idea that he was?One piece of evidence his delirium was authentic is the 1929 film he created with Luis Buñuel,Un Chien Andalou, in which a couple stand like the peasants in The Angelus (but with male and female positions reversed) until their love petrifies and they are buried in sand. This film, Dalí’s most spontaneous work of dream art, was made before he went public with his Millet obsession. So The Angelus really was lodged in his psyche. He soon repainted it in his 1933 work Archaeological Reminiscence of Millet’s Angelus, in which the couple become colossal, slowly eroding monuments towering over a desert.Dalí’s lifelong attempts to understand why The Angelus hooked him became a surreal odyssey of sex and death that is a good guide to enjoying a work of art. We should all be a bit paranoiac-critical when we visit an art gallery and let a work of art suggest as many things as come into our minds.I can relate to it because I’m strangely thrilled that Millet’s painting of two French peasants in a flat, bleak landscape with a church spire on the gold and bronze skyline is coming to the National Gallery. The first time I saw it was nowhere near a museum but in a hypermarket in rural France on a camping trip when I was a teenager. There it was, as a cheap print on canvas, this glowing, frozen scene. I had to buy it.Why does art capture us? Sometimes a particular painting just seems to say more than you can express, and stays inside you. This is the mystery of art, and the mystery of The Angelus. I’m not saying what I see in it – I am not sure I want to know, let alone confess it. But it calls me like a bell at twilight.Millet: Life on the Land is atthe National Gallery, London, from 7 August to 19 OctoberExplore more on these topicsPaintingArtExhibitionsNational GallerySalvador DalíVincent van GoghfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Digging deep helped her realise not everything can be fixedLaura SnapesThu 17 Jul 2025 03.00 EDTShareIn January 2023, as flash floods hit Auckland,New Zealand, Oakley Creek was destroyed: trees upturned, bridges ripped out and dragged downstream, the riverbankcollapsed. Like many locals, Liz Stokes, songwriter and guitarist in indie four-piece the Beths, had walked there often during the pandemic. “It’s jarring to see this place that’s never going to be the way it was, the way you remembered it,” she says over video in late June.She catches herself. “I say the creek was destroyed, but the creek did the destroying also. It’s just nature. It was interesting seeing change happen very quickly in real time.”The collapse became the subject of Mosquitoes, a wistful track on the Beths’ fourth album, Straight Line Was a Lie. As Stokes observes the wreckage she concludes: “The current has forgotten how it felt to break the world.” Even before you know the record’s backstory, her delivery imbues those languid creek waters with a sense of defeat, something deeper than just a postcard from her neighbourhood.Over four Beths albums, critics have singled out Stokes’s sensitive observations about anxiety and connection: she perfectly characterised flailing in the aftermath of broken relationships as being an “expert in a dying field”, the title of their last album. On that record’s Knees Deep, she expresses admiration for someone who always jumps feet-first into life while she’s “wading in up to the ankles” and fearing every second (although the whole bandbungee-jumped for the video).‘Intentionally or not, I’ve been putting walls between me and new experiences’The Beths’ magnetism comes from how these former jazz school students make jangly guitar pop as joyful and tender as Stokes’s lyrics are knotted with self-doubt. Pitchfork called their first album, 2018’s Future Me Hates Me “one of the most impressive indie-rock debuts of the year”. The band’s endearing image, including an excellently thorough blog run by bassist Ben Sinclair that documents their tour breakfasts, makes success seem like child’s play.Straight Line Was a Lie represents a levelling up: it’s their first for US label Anti, home to Waxahatchee and MJ Lenderman, heralding a tour of much bigger venues. It’s a long way from their founding pipe dream of playing Auckland’s 250-capacity Whammy Bar. “We’ve had to rewrite some of our pipe dreams so they’re a lot pipe-ier,” says Stokes. “We’re lucky that it’s grown so consistently so far.”View image in fullscreenBusy Lizzie … The Beths appearing at Primavera Sound in Madrid in 2023.Photograph: Mariano Regidor/RedfernsOur time difference means that while I’m drinking a breakfast coffee, Stokes, 34, is having an early-evening White Russian. “I was nervous about this interview,” she admits, “so I made myself a cocktail, but with milk instead of cream.” She is a little shy, talking from the home studio she shares with her bandmate, guitarist Jonathan Pearce, also the band’s producer and her romantic partner of  10 years. (Drummer Tristan Deck completes the band.) Stokes is a born catastrophiser. She has a sort ofyeah duhlaugh: “And you know what? I can’t believe that not everybody sees the world that way!”The title Straight Line Was a Lie encapsulates Stokes’s frustration at realising that life doesn’t always progress in a linear path. Coming out of the pandemic and the acclaim for 2022’s Expert in a Dying Field, she had hit “a real mental low point”. She was dealing with undiagnosed Graves’ disease, which affects the eyes, the thyroid gland and emotional regulation, feeling “depressed and very anxious and falling apart”.Being prescribed antidepressants was life-changing. “The anxiety that had been this constant presence in my brain was just kind of gone,” she says. “I started being able to make routines, the things you’re supposed to do, like exercising. I was like, oh my gosh, all this potential: I think I can fix everything in my life, my family relationships, my health.”Then the medication started to numb her out: “All my pleasures: guilty / Clean slate looking filthy / This year’s gonna kill me,” she sings onnew song No Joy, a perversely upbeat anthem about emotional nothingness. She felt healthy but disconnected, and struggled to write. “There’s a compass that when I write, it’s very instinctual and emotional to follow where the song wants to go,” she says. “It felt like it was uncalibrated, not pointing very strongly in any direction.”Being in a band is an exercise in sustainability. The moment it becomes unsustainable, you can’t do it any moreTo kickstart the engine, she and Pearce went to Los Angeles. Stokes loves living in Auckland and never did the classic “big OE” (overseas experience) that gives young Kiwis a visa to work abroad; she arrived in LA craving the sort of constant cultural stimulation of music, comedy and classic film screenings that’s harder to come by at home. “It made me want to write, and especially when the muscle was in action, it empowered me to want to do something better,” she says.As well as feeling sparked by shows by Drive-By Truckers, Momma and comedians Margaret Cho and John Mulaney, Stokes read books on writing byStephen KingandRobert Caro, and used a typewriter she received as a birthday present from Sinclair to do 10 pages of free-writing every day. Sitting down at the analogue keys “sounds incredibly pretentious”, she says, “but it was really fun. It makes a great sound. I’d be like, well, I have nothing to write about, and so I was digging into memories, emotions and relationships that I don’t think about because they’re very painful. Even now I’m struggling to look at it. It’s why I think this album has gone the way it’s gone, and I’ve been able to write about things that I normally would find too difficult.”View image in fullscreenFuture her loves her … Stokes performing in 2013.Photograph: Tim Mosenfelder/GettyOne of those songs, the moving guitar hymn Mother, Pray for Me, is about Stokes’s mum, who is Indonesian. Stokes was born in Jakarta and the family moved to Auckland when she was four. “I wanted to hurt you for the hurt you made in me,” she sings, wondering if they still have time to forge a connection. Stokes finished the song a year ago and finally played it for her mum the week before we speak. “English is not her first language and that’s part of why our relationship is complicated,” she says. “There’s so much love, but there’s this gulf of understanding between us where we want to connect but we live in these separate planes.”Showing her mum the song didn’t necessarily offer a resolution. “She was just like: ‘It’s very nice that you wrote a song for me’,” says Stokes. “She couldn’t quite parse the lyrics. It’s confusing – I’ve writtez n this thing about what I’m feeling, but it’s made what I’m feeling able to be understood by people like me, rather than by people like my mum. It’s one I’ll keep unpacking, but it was a huge relief to talk to her about it. Like anything, you build these things up in your head to be terrifying or impossible, then they’re actually fine.”Stokes eventually came off antidepressants to a newly confronting understanding: you can’t actually fix everything. Her Graves’ disease is medically regulated “but it affects you emotionally even once your thyroid numbers are under control,” she says. “There’s always going to be that kind of anxiety and depression – I’m reckoning with the fact that that’s maybe not going to ever go back to the way it used to be.” Counter to the prevailing culture of optimisation that insists life can be hacked to perfection, she realised that “everything is kind of maintenance. That sounds depressing but I don’t think it is. Why is maintenance so unsexy? It’s what you do for things that you love and you want to keep right, and I want to keep being me, so I have to keep on top of that.”In April, Stokes and Pearce returned to LA, in part for Stokes to play a rare solo gig at storied music and comedy venue Largo (where Aimee Mann and Fiona Apple evolved their craft). “We’ve done hundreds of Beths shows, but I’ve done like three solo shows,” she says. “For me, music feels like it’s something you do with other people. That’s what I would tell myself, but I was also really scared of just doing something for myself. I reached a point where I was like, OK, because you’re scared, you should probably do it.”The best albums of 2025 so farRead moreThe show went great, though Stokes is gearing up to tour with her bandmates – her best friends – come September. “You have to work at it, but we’re lucky to have each other, and we all understand that being in a band is an exercise in sustainability,” she says. “The moment it becomes unsustainable, you can’t do it any more. So we have to keep communicating and making sure everyone’s OK.”She credits Pearce in particular with helping to pull her out of her shell. On new album highlight Til My Heart Stops she yearns for him to help her live with reckless joy. “I’m sure a lot of people feel this, but I feel like I’m looking at the world as if I’m stuck behind something, like I’m not part of it,” she says. “Intentionally or unintentionally, I’m putting out walls between me and other people and new experiences. I want to be living in the world, I want someone to yank me out. I want to yank myself out.”Straight Line Was a Lie will be releasedon29 August.

And even better – it might have rediscovered its devastatingly emotional coreStuart HeritageThu 17 Jul 2025 07.30 EDTLast modified on Thu 17 Jul 2025 12.06 EDTShareObjectively, you should not be excited about the return ofStranger Things. Over the years, the Netflix smash has in many ways come to represent everything bad about television’s streaming era.It began as a fun piece of fluff, a one-and-done collection of overt 1980s film references, designed as the first part of an unconnected anthology. But then it exceeded expectations, so the Duffer brothers found themselves having to pull an entire mythology out of thin air. And a bloated one at that, full of (at best) bottle episodes about punky young superheroes and (at worst) self-indulgent episodes that grind on for hours and hours.And because the episodes were so gargantuan, they took years to make. This is why you shouldn’t be excited about the return of Stranger Things. Whatever happened in the last batch of episodes has long since receded from memory and they were so long that you cannot possibly build up the enthusiasm to watch them all again. It is less a series and more a Man v Food challenge, served up long after you’ve forgotten what your last meal tasted of.And yet the first trailer for the final batch of Stranger Things episodes has dropped and goddamn it if I’m not suddenly really excited about it.What happens in the trailer? It’s hard to say. Joe Keery turns a wheel in a van. A bunch of lights flicker. There are flamethrowers. Someone jumps between trees during a lightning storm, pursued by a demon. A bunch of four-legged monsters prowl around a kitchen like raptors in Jurassic Park. There are machine guns and fast cars, and crying and flying and Vecna throwing a sort of burning tornado at the sky, all accompanied by Deep Purple’s Child in Time.Does it make sense? Not really. Is it so overloaded with mythology and superfluous characters that you felt you needed a diagram to remind you who everyone was? Almost certainly. But could I feel my heart start to race as it went on? Yes. The Stranger Things trailer isn’t the best trailer I’ve ever seen, but it might qualify as themosttrailer I’ve ever seen, and sometimes that does the trick.More than anything, it reinforces the direction that Stranger Things has been heading for the past nine years. There will be not a single atom of subtlety in these episodes. Any nuance will be forced out by a powerhouse of spectacle. Things will explode. There will be CGI by the gallon. Characters will operate exclusively in emotional red zones. For better or worse, you will end this series exhausted.However, there is one small hint that – despite the heavy metal frenzy that whirls around it – Stranger Things knows how it will stick the landing. It comes in the form of a snatch of dialogue between Hopper and Eleven. It isn’t much (“Let’s end this, kid”) but it’s a sign the key relationship of the entire series is back on track.View image in fullscreen‘Let’s end this, kid’ … Millie Bobby Brown as Eleven in Stranger Things.Photograph: Courtesy of NetflixDespite all the excess – the monsters, the nostalgia – Stranger Things was always a show about parenthood. It’s the story of a man who finds a weird little girl with nowhere to go, who helps him rebuild himself after experiencing the most devastating bereavement. Any time it has leant into the found-family dynamic between Hopper and Eleven, Stranger Things has found an emotional wallop that cannot be overwhelmed by the whiz-bang chicanery of the rest of the show. This is where Stranger Things began and I pray this is where it will end.That’s the pull of this trailer. The final season of Stranger Things will surely be too long. There will be too many storylines. There will be children riding bicycles even though they are visibly so old they should really have been driving their own children to school for the past decade. But if it remembers to focus on its heart – on the dynamic between a man and a girl who saved each other – then it might be worth getting excited about Stranger Things after all.Explore more on these topicsStranger ThingsTelevisionNetflixfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Able to appeal to both young people and adults, she had more than a dozen top 20 hits, starting with Who’s Sorry Now? and including the No 1 songs Don’t Break the Heart That Loves You and The Heart Has a Mind of Its Own. Like other teen favorites of her time, she also starred in several films, including Where the Boys Are and Follow the Boys.The dark-haired singer was just 17 when she signed a contract with MGM Records following appearances on several TV variety shows. Her earliest recordings attracted little attention, but then she released her version of Who’s Sorry Now? an old ballad by Ted Snyder, Bert Kalmar and Harry Ruby.It, too, had little success initially until Dick Clark played it on his American Bandstand show in 1958. Francis followed with such teen hits as Stupid Cupid, Everybody’s Somebody’s Fool and Lipstick on Your Collar. Her records became hits worldwide as she re-recorded versions of her original songs in Italian and Spanish among other languages. Her concerts around the US quickly sold out.Meanwhile, a romance bloomed with fellow teen idol Bobby Darin, who had volunteered to write songs for her. But when her father heard rumors that the pair were planning a wedding he stormed into a rehearsal and pulled a gun on Darin, ending their relationship and seeming to set Francis on a pained and traumatic path.She chronicled some of it in her autobiography, Who’s Sorry Now?“My personal life is a regret from A to Z,” she told the Associated Press in 1984, the year the book came out. “I realized I had allowed my father to exert too much influence over me.”Her father, George Franconero, was a roofing contractor from New Jersey who played the accordion, and he had his daughter learn the instrument as soon as she began to show an aptitude for music. When she was four, he began booking singing dates for her, going on to become her manager.Although her acting career had faded by the mid-1960s, Francis was still popular on the concert circuit when she appeared at the Westbury Music center in Westbury, New York, in 1974. She had returned to her hotel room and was asleep when a man broke in and raped her at knifepoint. He was never captured.Francis sued the hotel, alleging its security was faulty, and a jury awarded her $2.5m in 1976. The two sides then settled out of court for $1,475,000 as an appeal was pending. She said the attack destroyed her marriage and put her through years of emotional turmoil.She suffered tragedy in 1981 when her brother George was shot to death as he was leaving his New Jersey home. Later in the decade, her father had her committed to a psychiatric hospital, where she was diagnosed as manic-depressive. At one point she attempted suicide by swallowing dozens of sleeping tablets. After three days in a coma, she recovered.She was married four times and would say that only her third husband, Joseph Garzilli, was worth the trouble. The other marriages each lasted less than a year.In 2025, Pretty Little Baby went viral on TikTok, introducing Francis to a new young audience. “To tell you the truth, I didn’t even remember the song!” she said toPeople. “I had to listen to it to remember. To think that a song I recorded 63 years ago is touching the hearts of millions of people is truly awesome. It is an amazing feeling.”Explore more on these topicsPop and rocknewsShareReuse this content"

You might want this,’” said Dante. “I’m not sure he knew what the sled was, but he must have had some inkling, or why else would he have asked me?“I was astonished. Since I am a huge fan of the movie, I said, ‘Yeah, I’ll be glad to take it.’”The prop is primarily pine hardwood, with the original paint but signs of both wear and tear on the lot and with a few missing rails, likely donated to the wartime drive for scrap metal.“I’ve had the honour of protecting this piece of cinematic history for decades,” Dante said in a statement released by action house Heritage. “To see Rosebud find a new home – and make history in the process – is both surreal and deeply gratifying. It’s a testament to the enduring power of storytelling.”Dante featured the sled in Explorers, as well as 1989’s The Burbs, Gremlins 2: The New Batch (1990) and an episode of the early 90s series Eerie, Indiana.The exact number of sleds produced for the film is unknown – the auction house says a “few” were made; one sold to Steven Spielberg in 1982 for $60,500 (£45,150) in 1982 and another to an anonymous buyer for $233,000 (£174,000) in 1996.Other sales in the auction include a filming miniature X-wing from The Empire Strikes Back, Indiana Jones’ bullwhip originally given to HRH Prince Charles by Harrison Ford at the royal premiere of Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, and Austin Powers’s green velvet suit.A nude photo of Marilyn Monroe is also available, armour from Ben-Hur and a Ralph Lauren blazer owned by Audrey Hepburn.“This is one of the most important events in entertainment auction history,” said Heritage Auctions executive vice president Joe Maddalena. “These aren’t just props. They’re mythic objects. They tell the story of Hollywood’s greatest moments, one piece at a time, each tied to a memory, a performance, a legend.”Explore more on these topicsFilmOrson WellesnewsShareReuse this content"

What’s so frustrating is that this really matters right nowStuart HeritageThu 17 Jul 2025 17.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 17 Jul 2025 17.01 EDTShareIt’s never a particularly encouraging sign when the title of a documentary ends with a question mark. It might just be a tiny scrap of punctuation, and yet it can single-handedly undermine an entire thesis.Take the latest episode ofDispatches. A film called Trump: Moscow’s Man in the White House would hit like a juggernaut. That film would be an authoritative, definitive hammer blow, confirming beyond doubt what many have suspected for years: that Donald Trump is either working with or an unwitting puppet of Putin’s Russia. This film would represent a clean punch landed. It would reverberate around the world.And yet what we are given is a film called Trump: Moscow’s Man in the White House? Immediately, the question mark renders the whole thing unappealing. There will be no clean punches here, no definitive proof of anything. You will end the hour with minimal new information, and your mind will remain profoundly unchanged. In other words, what a weird shrug of a show this is.The film begins with a whistle-stop tour of everything you’ve known about for the best part of a decade. The Kremlin collecting information on Trump during his marriage to his Czech Republic-born first wife Ivana. Numerous Russians investing in Trump’s property portfolio as his other businesses failed. The 2016 election interference. Steele. Mueller. Helsinki. Zelenskyy. It would have been a muscular first act that set the stage for a cunning development – some vital new evidence that ties everything together or at the very least moves the story on – except as the film wears on, you realise with a horrible lurch that this isn’t the first act. It’s the whole thing.And it’s hard to see this as anything but a failure; something akin to reading a Twitter thread in 2018. Which isn’t to say the film lacks access. John Bolton is interviewed. Former CIA counterintelligence head Susan Miller is interviewed. We meetFBI agent turned whistleblower Johnathan Buma. And yet none of them can answer the episode’s central question. Bolton says people told him that Trump worked for the Russians, but he was disinclined to believe it. Miller carefully lays out the extremely vague CIA definition of a Russian asset, only to hedge by suggesting that Trump “could be” one, which is no help to anybody.What’s so frustrating is that this really matters. As Russia’s invasion of Ukraine rumbles on, and Trump’s level of involvement seems to oscillate by the minute, this is absolutely the time to cast fresh eyes on his relationship with Putin. And yet, bizarrely, Ukraine comes off as an afterthought. It’s used cynically as a bookend, dropped in at the very beginning and the very end to try and hypnotise the viewer into believing they’ve watched something more timely than they actually have.More focus on the present day would have improved things immeasurably. Early on we met Nathaniel Raymond, who was part of the US State Department Conflict Observatory Program, which worked to record war crimes committed by Russia. His testimony is nothing short of staggering. His investigation led him to estimate that 35,000 Ukrainian children – some as young as eight months old – have beensystematically abducted and reeducated by Russian forces, in what amounts to industrialised kidnapping. Real progress was being made in tracking them. But then Trump was reelected, and almost instantly cut the program’s funding.The segment is a ghost of what the film could have been – an up-to-the-minute exploration of howDoge cutbackshave redefined the connections between Trump and Putin – but instead, gallingly, we are taken by the hand and led towards yet more hoary old speculation about theMiss Universe pee-pee tapes.Perhaps the film-makers know they’re doomed to be outpaced by current events and have simply resigned themselves to it. This week alone there seems to have been a shift inthe way Trump deals with Russia, supplying Ukraine with missiles and threatening Moscow with crippling tariffs.But recent evidence suggests that Trump operates on a whim. By this time next week he could have withdrawn his support, or alienated Zelenskyy with a brash demand. He could have ended the war, or he could have made it a thousand times worse. There’s no way of knowing. The whole thing is playing out at the speed of light, and it’s almost impossible to document. If you were tasked with making a film about Trump’s relationship with Russia, wouldn’t you take the easy option and focus on the past, too?Dispatches: Trump: Moscow’s Man in the White House? is on Channel 4Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewDonald TrumpVladimir PutinDocumentaryFactual TVreviewsShareReuse this content"

It’s not the smartest, but the mountains are lovelyRebecca NicholsonThu 17 Jul 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 17 Jul 2025 03.02 EDTShareUntamed is a blunt force thriller, set in Yosemite national park in California, starringEric Banaas a macho special agent who prefers silence to talking and horses to motorised vehicles. It is perfectly serviceable though oddly retro – not just because it scoffs at petrol engines, but because it feels as if it could have been made in the 1990s. Even a crucial smartphone plotline doesn’t come into it until very close to the end, and although park rangers have become a political hot potato in the US, national politics emphatically do not exist here.That makes Untamed an undemanding watch, but don’t expect much depth. It’s as easy on the eye as it is straightforward. Bana is Kyle Turner, technically not a park ranger, even though he’s dressed like one, but an ISB Special Agent, which gives him extra-special cop powers. Devotees of detective dramas will be shocked to learn that Turner is brusque, rude and has a taste for bourbon that doesn’t have any impact on his professional capacity whatsoever. He is haunted by a family tragedy. His personal relationships are poor. He is, of course, excellent at what he does.This makes a fairytale of both detective work and the great outdoors, which I can’t say I mind too much. Turner is so at one with Yosemite that he can find strands of hair or individual beads in the vast swathes of wilderness, all 300,000 hectares of it of it. I can barely find my keys in the hallway, never mind a crucial clue partly buried in a vast national park, but that is why I don’t ride to work on a horse.It begins with a pair of climbers on El Capitan summit, whose steady ascent is interrupted by the falling body of a young woman, who gets tangled up in their ropes. Was she chased by an animal, or is it more sinister than that? Naturally Turner goes above and beyond, scoffing at warnings of lightning to examine the dangling body. He takes note of the foliage in her hand and where it grows and notes the lack of animal tracks on the summit. He pays attention to the details, like Bear Grylls with a badge. He says things like, “This is not LA. Things happen different out here,” and, “You can’t spell wilderness without wild.”That gives a decent idea of what you’re in for. It is unapologetically meat and two veg, sincere and far-fetched. Initially, it looks to be a case-of-the-week setup, not dissimilar toElsbethorPoker Face, but reverse-engineered to have the humour sucked out of it. The body of the young woman turns out be a gateway into a wider conspiracy, a criminal underbelly lurking beneath the tourist-playground parts of the national park. There is a sense that it has ambitions to beTrue Detective-like, or at least, early True Detective, and there is a touch of rural noir to it too. Turner is haunted by his past, and trapped in the wilderness by his own demons. His young sidekick, Vasquez (a very good Lily Santiago), formerly an inner-city LA cop running from her own issues, thinks he has just moved into his cabin, because it is full of boxes. He has been there for years.The supporting cast is strong. Sam Neill is Turner’s boss, friend and ally Captain Souter, trying to defend Turner from the PR-led bureaucracy of the park’s superintendent, whose main goal is to keep tourist numbers up, which means keeping any sense of peril out of the headlines. Rosemarie DeWitt is Turner’s ex-wife, who still receives phone calls from him in the middle of the night. Though Untamed is largely confined to trails and cabins, it occasionally busts the budget on a helicopter or an explosion.Still, as serviceable as it is, it leaves the impression of having once had the bones of a more elegant thriller, softened to become a more standard, more palatable prospect. It’s twisty, but it doesn’t take much to guess what those twists are, and where they will lead. Turner is the flawed hero upon whom everyone else must depend. The female characters are mostly troublesome, and there to be saved; if you find long, lingering shots of women’s bodies on mortuary slabs gratuitous, this is not the show for you.This is US television in 2025, then: manly, gruff and outdoorsy. It opens with a sweeping shot of forests and mountains, before the American flag moves into the centre of the frame. There are bear attacks, gunfights and near-biblical levels of vengeance. It’s not the smartest of thrillers, but those mountains sure are lovely to look at.Untamed is onNetflixnowExplore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV reviewTelevisionEric BanaDramareviewsShareReuse this content"

There’s a wealth of colour in Lozano Rolong’s velvet-toned soprano, and her words are immediate and expressive – even in the patter of a song such as Uirapuru by the Brazilian Waldemar Henrique, which zips through so much local folklore that its text needs eight footnotes. Other highlights include a haunting lullaby by Argentina’s Gilardo Gilardi, two almost Puccini-esque songs by the Mexican composer María Grever, and another lullaby, this time dreamier, by Colombia’s Luis Carlos Figueroa. The programme doesn’t have an obvious centre of gravity, but it’s full of small-scale discoveries – including two folk song arrangements by the playwright Federico García Lorca. With Araújo offering beautifully judged support, it showcases Lozano Rolong as a captivating and hugely promising performer.Listen on Apple MusicAllow content provided by a third party?This article includes content hosted onembed.music.apple.com.

Chua – joint winner of the junior Menuhin Competition in 2018, aged 11 – was 15 and 16 when she made these recordings. The framework is conventional – there are no great surprises in the tempos, and she is backed by the modern instruments of the Singapore Symphony Orchestra, who give an energised but refined performance conducted by Hans Graf. So far, so traditional. And yet Chua consistently holds the attention with interpretations that are notably mature: balanced, considered and never trying too hard. The faster movements having a gentle momentum, the slow ones plenty of space; everything Chua plays has a clean, focused tone, an unfailingly elegant turn of phrase and a quiet wit.View image in fullscreenThe artwork for Mozart Violin ConcertosAs well as the five concertos we also get three stand-alone movements, two rondos and an adagio – and, most rewardingly, the Sinfonia Concertante, for which Chua is joined by the violist Ziyu He, anotherMenuhin Competition winner, his mellow-toned lines dovetailing perfectly with hers. Granted, these performances may not stand out dramatically in a very crowded field, but they are certainly worth your time.Allow content provided by a third party?This article includes content hosted onembed.music.apple.com.

The freedom of heading out on my bike and not knowing where I’m going to pitch my tent that night. Now that my children are aged seven and nine, I wanted to introduce them to the liberation of this kind of adventure. They adore a day out on their bikes, but this was to be our first multiday bike trip as a family of four, so it was crucial to find a route easy and fun enough to captivate them.View image in fullscreenIllustration: Guardian GraphicsTheMaasroutefollows the course of the Maas River as it meanders for 300 miles (484km) through the Netherlands, from the inland city of Maastricht to the Hook of Holland, then loops back to Rotterdam. It forms part of the much longer Meuse cycle route (EuroVelo 19) that stretches from the source of the Maas (or Meuse as it’s known in France) on the Langres plateau, travelling through the French and Belgian Ardennes before crossing into the Netherlands.Our plan was to cycle the 100-mile stretch from Maastricht to Dordrecht over four days, traversing expansive floodplains dotted with castles, windmills and villages of thatched houses, crisscrossing the Maas on charming little ferries and pitching our tent at family-friendly campsites. This being the Netherlands, the terrain is predominantly pancake-flat with protected bike paths and low-traffic roads, making it an ideal first bike trip location for budding cyclists.View image in fullscreenThe medieval Sint Servaasbrug bridge in Maastricht.Photograph: Marc Venema/AlamyFor route planning, we used a foldout Dutch cycling map for perspective and nostalgia, in combination with the essential and freeLF-routes long-distance cycling app. As we were living in Leiden, we took the train to Maastricht and stayed in a hostel overnight. We carried all our camping gear on rented Dutch city bikes in small everyday panniers, with the overflow in a backpack so the children had nothing to haul. The Hook of Holland is on the Maasroute, so it’s possible to bring your own gear and bikes on an overnight voyage across the North Sea from Harwich.We set off from Maastricht in the morning sunshine full of first-day energy and cycled five blocks to Sint Servaasbrug, which is an unmissable seven-arched limestone pedestrian and cycle bridge, built in the 1280s to replace a Roman river crossing. This detour, and a not-so-quick stop at the supermarket for picnic ingredients, made getting out of town hairy. However, we soon found ourselves leaving the city and following reassuringly wide cycle paths out into the idyllic water meadows of Limburg, with the Maas as our constant companion.View image in fullscreenThe pancake-flat terrain and low-traffic roads make the Netherlands ideal for young cyclistsAs the day wore on the heat escalated, so to keep the children on side, we stopped for mango ice lollies followed directly by gelato atTerras Maasoeverat Urmond, a breezy bankside restaurant servingbroodjesandbiertjes(sandwiches and beers) on a terrace overlooking a small river ferry crossing to Belgium.By the time we arrived at our first campsite at theJachthaven de Maasterp, in the picturesque village of Ohé en Laak, we were wilting. Luckily, the marina’sBrasserie Knaag & Codidn’t disappoint, with lakeside views, swimming beaches and playgrounds, so we could cool off and toast the success of the girls’ first 30-mile ride.View image in fullscreenWaiting for a ferry at Ohé en Laak.Photograph: Ralf Liebhold/AlamyThe next morning we set off early, slathered in sun cream and with spirits high, to cross the Maasplassen, a vast network of human-made lakes that has become a popular destination for water sports. It felt as if we were cycling through a Van Gogh painting as an endless parade of sailing boats and sloops cruised by. After a coffee at theGrand Café Aemiliusin Maasbracht – served with a side shot of amaretto and topped with whipped cream – we powered along the straight road to Roermond in the midday sun (I credit the amaretto). Our goal was the aqua park at theLandal de Lommerbergenholiday park where we enjoyed a carefree afternoon racing down slides and plunging into swimming pools.With bedtimes out of the window, we rode the final stretch of that day’s route at 10pm, enjoying the cool evening air. With another 30-mile ride under our belts, we waited in happy silence with two lone night cyclists for the ferry to Kessel, with the backdrop of Kasteel de Keverberg, a hilltop castle that dates back to AD950, on the bank across the river. Giddy from the day’s adventures, we set up our tent among the trees atNatuurcamping en Camperplaats Boezevenin the last of the light.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Remembering the objective of fun with the children rather than mileage, we decided to catch a train from Venlo to Breda. (Fortunately, taking bikes on trains in the Netherlands is straightforward, with dedicated carriages that can take up to four bikes outside weekday rush hours for €7.50 each). Disembarking at Breda, we navigated our way to theBiesbosch national park, Europe’s largest freshwater tidal zone, where our pitch at theKurenpolder campsitein Hank came with a sunset view of the lake.The key to a successful family cycling adventure is to strike the right balance between the hard work of pedalling and relaxation. The next morning we visited theBiesbosch climbing park, where our girls enjoyed a couple of laps around the high ropes course. A win, but it meant delaying our start time. We thought the afternoon would hold an easy cycle ride across the national park, but only a few miles in, my partner Andrew had a total tyre and tube blowout, which required expert help to repair. We had to make Dordrecht that evening, so I pressed ahead with the girls, cycling along the tops of dykes and past an endless stream of vibrant blue and green creeks and willow flood forests. Eventually, Andrew caught up with us at theBiesbosch Museumterrace for a cold drink and the early evening ferry across the river to Dordrecht, the oldest and one of the most picturesque Dutch cities, with a blend of gothic, Renaissance and Dutch golden age architecture.View image in fullscreenFinal destiantion … Dordrecht.Photograph: fokkebok/Getty ImagesStanding on the deck in the breeze, balancing our bikes on that final river crossing, we were low on energy but full of joy and satisfaction. The girls loved the wide bike paths that cut across pristine meadows and the freedom of camping somewhere different each night, but mostly they were exhausted – from days in the sun, pedalling, climbing, swimming and late nights snuggled together as a family in our tent. I liked doing the trip as a family team, and that the girls were learning to take pleasure in doing the gritty, challenging things in life. It will serve them well.‘A muddy ride into Romania’s dreamy countryside’: cycling the Via TransilvanicaRead moreIf I were planning the trip again, I would allow at least a week and I might concede a detour toEfteling theme parknear Tilburg. The Maasroute was uniformly high quality, beautiful and easy to use. The signposting was so impressive at every turn that it was hardly necessary to refer to the map, freeing you up to be completely present on the ride. The route is well served by campsites, hotels and public transport, so it’s straightforward to adapt your adventure along the way to suit your family’s cycling capacity. However, this does require constant planning and puzzle-solving. Set expectations for a fun, challenging adventure rather than a relaxed holiday. And build in lots of ice-cream stops.The writer and family stayed attheGreen Elephanthostelin Maastricht (family room€78). The sauna and morning coffee were included.

Like bumping into a teacher outside school or witnessing someone take off their shoes during a flight. It’s legal, sure, but there’s always a moment of deep discomfort and confusion before acceptance. And that’s pretty much how I imagine many people feel about drinking port in summer. Or, indeed, at any time of the day that isn’t evening, or served alongside anything that isn’t an intriguing, veiny cheese.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Consider Porto, the city responsible for bringing the drink to the rest of the world – do you think that, when the temperatures creep up, everyone there stops drinking the stuff? No, they find new ways to enjoy it. Improvise, adapt, overcome.The most popular way to incorporate the joys of port into summertime drinking is to serve it with a mixer. Enter the port tonic (portonic?), a likely combination of the fortified wine of the region and the British presence in its trade. (For a basic portonic, fill a glass with ice, add 50ml port and top with tonic, although you probably guessed that already.) You can make it with pretty much any port, depending on how precious you are about swirling your top-shelf stuff into tonic or soda water. The last time I was in Porto, I was visiting Cockburn’s, and white port and tonic was the soupe du jour – for a typical serving, add a wedge of lemon or lime and a sprig of mint.Looking for something a bit different? I asked a few professionals. “As well as serving it with soda, we also use white port in longer, citrus-led punches,” says Anna Šebelová of Edinburgh’sTimberyard. “We love it in the likes of a 50:50 martini with an aromatic gin, where it replaces vermouth beautifully.”“With dessert, I sometimes serve an upgrade on the average port and tonic,” says Andy Beynon, chef/owner ofBehindin London. “I top it up with verjus, which adds a floral element from the unripened grapes. It’s perfect with summer dishes featuring mango and lime or coconut sorbet.”Anything else? Everything I’ve learned about the existence ofthe Cheeky Vimtococktail has been against my will. It’s a 50ml measure of ruby port topped up with WKD Blue, something I haven’t had the, er, pleasure of trying yet, but if that’s your bag, go for it.Ports, tonics, Cheeky Vimtos: whatever you’re drinking, never mind what you serve it in – a highball, a rocks glass, a wine glass, a pint glass. It’s a mere vessel to allow the transportation of liquid sustenance to your body when the world is on fire, in more ways than one.Four ports to sip while the sun’s outMorrisons Ruby Port£9.50 (75cl), 19%.

Following the ceremony, the double doors were opened wide, so friends and family could line the ramp all the way to the edge of the lagoon. There, standing majestically at the end of a green gondola, was Adriana’s childhood friend Giulia, a champion ofvoga Veneta,or Venetian rowing, ready to take the couple to the other side of the island for lunch.While Giulia rowed Adriana and Thom around the island, the rest of us walked across it toTrattoria Da Romano, where Adriana’s family have celebrated for lifetimes, and it was completely given over to our euphoric wedding party. I am sure I would remember all seven courses (several of which involved more than one dish) even if I didn’t have the menu memento stuck to our fridge with a cat magnet. What I remember most vividly, though, is the fish risotto, because Adriana told me to get near enough the kitchen door to see how energetically the chefs beat it, and how soft and rippling the texture was.It was a perfect example ofrisotto all’onda, which means “risotto with a wave”. It thickens during the passage from pan to plate, becoming dense and creamy and moving slowly in a sort-of ripple on the plate (I was really taken by the way the waiters tapped the plate to even out the rice).Seeing both the beating and the serving made me realise that I still have much to learn when it comes to getting the consistency right. For now, I find it helpful to think of the consistency as being closer to creamy porridge than to rice: loose but not soupy. With this in mind, this week’s recipe is a novice risotto with courgettes, which is also helped by the addition of cream cheese.Serve immediately with very cold white wine. And, for afters, and also inspired by Adriana and Thom, a mixture of lemon sorbet, vodka and prosecco, AKAsgroppino.Risotto with courgettes, goat’s cheese and lemonServes44 medium courgettes1.6 litresvegetable brothOlive oil30g unsalted butter2 shallots, peeled and finely diced400g carnaroli rice100g mild goat’s or cream cheese30g parmesan, gratedFinely grated zest of 1 unwaxed lemonTop and tail the courgettes. Grate two of them on the coarse side of a box grater, and cut the other two into thin slices with a mandoline or sharp knife. Pat the slices with kitchen towel, then rub with olive oil and cook on a griddle pan until tender and marked with lines. Cut the grilled courgettes into thin strips and keep warm.Put the stock in a pan at the back of the stove and bring to a gentle simmer. In a heavy-based wide saucepan, warm two tablespoons of olive oil and 10g of the butter, then gently fry the shallots until soft. Add the grated courgettes and move them around for a minute, then add the rice and stir so it clatters against the sides of the pan for two minutes – it should be glossy and glassy.Add a ladle of broth, stir until it’s absorbed, then repeat, adding broth and stirring over a low-medium heat that keeps the risotto barely simmering, for about 17 minutes, until the rice is plump and the consistency is soft and rippling – like a creamy porridge, but not soupy.Take off the heat, beat in the butter, goat’s cheese or cream cheese and parmesan, then stir or, better still, jolt the pan so the risotto comes up and over in a wave that mixes the ingredients and also loosens starch.Meanwhile, very quickly reheat the strips of courgette in a pan, then add the lemon zest. Divide the risotto between four plates, bash the sides of the plates so the risotto spreads, and top each serving with a little pile of grilled courgette strips.Explore more on these topicsRiceA kitchen in RomeFoodItalian food and drinkMain courseCheeserecipesShareReuse this content"

You might return to it years later, and even enjoy it – but it should never hit quite the same way as it did that first summer it was everywhere.Unfortunately, this high-season, low-stakes tradition has been tested over the past decade by our heavily saturated yet highly atomised consumer culture. These days, we’re flooded with options (rosorange wine? Smoked beers?) but struggle to align behind any of them. The TikTok-driven trend cycle doesn’t help, claiming every teenager’s cupboard-raiding concoction is the next big thing.So I was taken aback – and a little delighted – when the drink of this summer made itself known to me as though it were the year 2015, not 2025: organically, insistently and right on time. It’s Lonkero: gin mixed with grapefruit soda, available on draught and served in pints.I feel confident in my pick, but I’ve also included some alternatives. The debate, after all, is part of the fun.Lonkero, or Finnish long drinkI first learned of Lonkero on 18 June, when a friend messaged our group chat saying she’d just tried one at the pub, and that it had been “occupying a lot of brain space” since.None of us had ever heard of it. The next day, another friend tried it, was instantly won over and bought a case. Then it came up again at my gym, an entirely different social circle. Then a second pub started serving it.When I finally got around to tryingLonkero, I was immediately converted – and, judging by the pint glasses containing telltale grapefruit wedges on all the tables surrounding me, most of Norwich had been, too.“We’re bizarrely doing very well in Norwich,” confirms the Lonkero co-founder Paige Gibbons. Other UK hotspots include Edinburgh, Brighton and pockets of London; they have also just started distributing to the north.Though Lonkero is a new brand, having launched in May last year, the drink itself dates back to 1952, and the Helsinki Olympic Games. To mark the occasion, the host nation came up with a premixed beverage of gin and grapefruit soda; it proved such a hit, with locals as well as visitors, it stuck.The genericlonkero(“long drink” in English) has since been dubbed the national drink of Finland. The Lonkero co-founder Joe Harris developed a taste for it while working in Helsinki, then teamed up with Gibbons to bring it to the UK.For Gibbons, not a fan of beer or cider, Lonkero held instant appeal as an easy-drinking beverage served in pints. “I always used to joke that I was fed up with paying double the price for a drink that I’d finish sooner,” she says.She was not alone: in its first six months, Lonkero sold more than 50,000 pints. Distribution has been focused on pubs, which can offer Lonkero on tap and present it as an alternative to a session ale or cider (rather than an alcopop or even a G&T). Gibbons describes it as a “new category of drink”.“What we’ve found is that, if people try it, they get it,” she says. “Word of mouth has been phenomenal for us – if you find it and like it, it’s actually something you tell your friends about.”That shareable quality, I’d argue, is the X-factor that distinguishes a bona fide drink of the summer from one drummed up for clicks. Very few of the beverages that go viral on TikTok actually make an impact in pubs and bars (and I would know). Lonkero, on the other hand, has hit Norwich with unmistakable force. At this rate, we might wind up with a pub for every day of the year and a Lonkero pub for every Sunday.Spicy paloma (or spicy margarita)View image in fullscreen‘It combines two already trendy cocktails: the paloma and the spicy margarita.’Photograph: cdwheatley/Getty ImagesOf course, as much as the answer should be obvious, the debate is part of what makes the “drink of the summer” question so compelling.Stylist magazine was early to call it, declaring back in May that the2025 beverageof choice was the spicy paloma. It was a safe pick, combining two already trendy cocktails: the paloma and the spicy margarita.The traditional paloma combines tequila, grapefruit soda and lime juice; in this case, the addition of jalapeños or chilli peppers and often a spicy rim add kick.At the time of Stylist’s report, it was already being offered at many trendy London joints, but has the added advantage of being easy to whip up off-menu.Spritz with a twistView image in fullscreen‘The holiday hasn’t begun until you’ve got a bright orange beverage in a goldfish-bowl glass in your hand.’Photograph: RooM the Agency/AlamyThe Aperol spritzmay have ushered in the concept of the “drink of the summer”; it remains the defining example, along with the less syrupy Campari spritz. Still today, the holiday hasn’t officially begun until you have a bright orange beverage in a goldfish-bowl glass in your hand.In the years since Aperol’s peak, however, there have been rumblings of dissent: it’s too sweet, too obvious, too 2021 …Thissummer’s spritz of choicehas been declared the Hugo (or St-Germain) spritz, comprising elderflower cordial, prosecco, soda water, mint and lime. It signals your discernment amid an orange sea – and, even better, it’s now available in a can from M&S.If elderflower is too subtle for you, the limoncello spritz – another new M&S cocktail – is a similarly sweet and eye-catching alternative to Aperol, like replacing your tired old orange highlighter with a snazzy yellow one.Naked and famousIf you are unwilling to be parted from Aperol, anaked and famousmight be your next favourite order.Delish magazine’s pick for drink of summer 2025, the cocktail packs a heavy punch with equal parts mezcal, yellow chartreuse, Aperol and fresh lime juice.It was devised in 2011 by the New York bartender Joaquín Simó, who described it as a “more evolved, refined margarita”, and has been steadily gaining popularity along with mezcal.If anything thwarts your order, it will be the chartreuse. The French herbal liqueur hasbeen in short supplysince the Carthusian monks who produce it decided to focus instead on “solitude and prayer”.BuzzBallzView image in fullscreen‘The globular pre-mixed cocktail loved by gen Z.’Photograph: Matt Fidler/The GuardianYou may have already learned on this website ofBuzzBallz, the globular pre-mixed cocktails loved by gen Z, available in flavours including Tequila ’Rita, Lotta Colada and Choc Tease.They tick many of the boxes for “drink of the summer”: they’re attention-grabbing on social media, a conversation starter in person (did you know the company is female-owned?), and highly portable: is that a BuzzBallz in your pocket or are you just happy to see me?They are not more offensive than most pre-mixed cocktails – and almost impressively refined, given the high alcohol content – but the taste is rather beside the point. Faced with the novel selection of brightly coloured balls, they feel more like Pokémon than beverages: you want to try ’em all.For the moment, until gen Z moves on, BuzzBallz have the added advantage of making you seem youthful and in the know by association.Suntory –196View image in fullscreen‘For those not sure they have the prerequisite rizz for BuzzBallz.’Photograph: SUNTORYFor those not sure they have the prerequisite rizz for BuzzBallz, Suntory -196 is a more grown-up yet still novel alternative.The vodka-based RTDs are a vending-machine staple in Suntory’s native Japan, butonly launched in the UKlast year; they are now widely available in supermarkets (though, sadly, not vending machines), in grapefruit and lemon flavours.The name (“minus one nine six”) refers to the temperature at which fruit is frozen, using liquid nitrogen, before being crushed into powder and mixed with shochu and vodka. With half the alcohol content of BuzzBallz, they are a safer bet in more ways than one.White Claw and ‘ranch water’View image in fullscreenRanch water is best served on a flamingo.Photograph: Image by Marie LaFauci/Getty ImagesAt the opposite end of the youthful-abandon spectrum is a growing subcategory that might be termed “fitspo bevs”.Where ordering a vodka soda marks you as calorie-conscious, unchill and so 90s, today’s trend for “hard seltzers” is positioned as optimisation, not deprivation.White Claw, my own longtime premix of choice, is best described as fruit-flavoured fizzy water with an ambiguous-sounding “gluten-free malted alcohol base” (not vodka, but some other thing).In April, the makers launched a limited-edition Green Apple flavour, just in time forbrat summerround two.An even more streamlined option is “ranch water”: basically, fizzy water spiked with white tequila and lime. The New York Times recipesuggests spicing it upwith a salt rim, and a splash of Cointreau or flavoured syrup – but even that might be too much fuss for purists.‘Coke and beer – in one glass, please’: my gut-churning search for a signature drinkRead moreMelbourne’s ‘Mont Blanc’ and Bristol’s TiramibruIf the drink of the summer isn’t alcoholic, it tends to skew towards a refreshing dessert. Tiramisu is emerging as the flavour of these summer months, with Starbucks UK winning over gen Z with its limited-edition tiramisu-inspireddrinks menu.The secret to its success has been “cold foam”: an airy, frothy, dairy topping that sits on top of iced coffees (leading Slateto declare the drinkof the summer … foam).In Bristol, Full Court Press cafehas been doing brisktrade in its new Tiramibru: nitrogen-infused cold-brew coffee, topped with a shaken jersey pouring cream, mixed with a hint of panela sugar and a dusting of chocolate powder.Co-owner Jonny Simpson describes it as a twist on the iced-coffee-with-cream drinks that are popular across east Asia and recently went viral in Melbourne as a “Mont Blanc”. “We wanted to run a dessert-like drink that felt like an afternoon treat,” he says. “It tastes like a liquid tiramisu, hence the name.”It has proved extremely popular, even at £5 a pop. “We often struggle to keep up with the cold-brew production on hot days.”The Tiramibru will run to the end of the summer; Simpson is already thinking of how to adapt it for winter.It is, after all, a less crowded market.Explore more on these topicsCocktailsFood & drink industryAlcoholFoodSummer food and drinkfeaturesShareReuse this content"
