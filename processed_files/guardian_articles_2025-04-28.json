Hundreds stumbled along pitch-black metro tunnels using their phone torches; others scrambled for basics in supermarkets that could only take cash, or began long trudges home from work.Mobile networks went down and internet access was cut as power failed at 12.33pm (11.33 BST). Hospitals postponed routine operations but used generators to attend to critical cases, and while electronic banking was able to function on backup systems, most ATM screens were blank.Spain and Portugal power outage: what caused it, and was there a cyber-attack?Read moreIn scenes reminiscent of the 2003 outage that caused widespread blackouts in the US north-east, rail services across the Iberian peninsula were halted, air traffic disrupted and traffic lights extinguished. Hundreds of people had to be rescued from jammed lifts.View image in fullscreenTravellers were left stranded as the blackout knocked out most forms of transportation.Photograph: José Jordan/AFP/Getty ImagesThe mayor of Madrid, José Luis Martinez-Almeida, urged people to minimise their journeys and stay where they were, adding: “It is essential that the emergency services can circulate.”Play at the Madrid Open tennis tournament was suspended.Sánchez said it was still too early to know what had caused the cut, but that nothing was being ruled out.“Just how long it will take to get back to normal is something that [the national grid operator] Red Eléctrica still can’t say for sure,” he said. “There has never been a drop to zero in the system before and the idea now is to keep on with the progressive and prudent restoration of the supply to avoid any setbacks over the coming hours.”By 10pm local time on Monday, 62% of Spain’s substations were back online (421 of 680) and 43.3% of the power demand had been met, while Portugal’s grid operator REN said it had restored power to 85 of the country’s 89 substations.Red Eléctrica had previously cautioned that it could take between six and 10 hours to fully restore supply after what it called an “exceptional and totally extraordinary” incident.View image in fullscreenRoads across Spain were largely deserted by Monday evening.Photograph: Pierre-Philippe Marcou/AFP/Getty ImagesAlong a major thoroughfare in Madrid’s Argüelles neighbourhood, the restoration of the power supply prompted whoops of delight and a round of hearty applause among the many people wandering the street.Sánchez said that the power cut originated at 12.33pm, when, for five seconds, 15 gigawatts of the energy that was being produced – equivalent to 60% of all the energy that was being used – suddenly disappeared.“That’s something that has never happened before,” he added. “What prompted this sudden disappearance of the supply is something that the experts still haven’t been able to determine. But they will … All potential causes are being analysed and no hypothesis or possibility is being ruled out.”The Portuguese operator, REN, said the outage was caused by a “rare atmospheric phenomenon”, with extreme temperature variations in Spain causing “anomalous oscillations” in very high-voltage lines.REN said the phenomenon, known as “induced atmospheric vibration”, caused “synchronisation failures between the electrical systems, leading to successive disturbances across the interconnected European network”.Widespread outages are unusual in Europe. In 2003, a problem with a hydroelectric power line between Italy and Switzerland caused blackouts for about 12 hours, and in 2006 an overloaded power network in Germany caused electricity cuts across parts of the country and in France, Italy, Spain, Austria, Belgium and the Netherlands.Sánchez thanked France and Morocco for sending additional electricity to Spain, and said the current shortfall would be eased using gas and hydroelectric power.The prime minister said additional national police and Guardia Civil officers had been deployed across the country to ensure people’s safety overnight, adding that hospitals were functioning well thanks to the efforts of healthcare workers.View image in fullscreenThe outages created long queues for transport, such as buses, that were still operational.Photograph: Bruna Casas/ReutersHe said telecommunications services were still suffering interruptions, mainly because of a lack of electricity supply to antennae.Sánchez said that only 344 of the 6,000 flights in Spain on Monday had been cancelled, and that the country’s roads network was working well, barring some tailbacks.The main travel disruption had occurred on the rail network, where 35,000 passengers trapped on more than 100 trains had been helped by rail companies and the military emergencies unit. Eleven more trains that had stopped in remote areas were still waiting to be reached.In Madrid and other cities, traffic lights ceased to function, causing gridlock as vehicles slowed to avoid collisions, while metros were halted. Spain’s national road authority, DGT, urged motorists to avoid using the roads as much as possible.El País newspaper posted photos and video on its website of passengers navigating darkened metro tunnels in the Spanish capital and police directing traffic on the city’s streets. Footage also showed its own reporters working by torchlight.The Spanish health ministry said in a social media update it was in contact with regional authorities to assess the scope of the widespread blackout but reassured the public that hospitals had supplementary systems in place.In Portugal, the outage hit the capital, Lisbon, and surrounding areas, as well as northern and southern parts of the country. Lisbon metro carriages were evacuated and ATMs and electronic payment systems cut out.The Portuguese water supplier EPAL said water supplies could be disrupted, prompting queues to form at stores as people rushed to buy bottled water and other emergency supplies such as gas lights, generators and battery-powered radios.View image in fullscreenShops were swamped by people looking for emergency items, such as torches and radios.Photograph: Adri Salido/Getty ImagesSánchez said that eight of Spain’s 17 autonomous regions – Andalucía, Castilla-La Mancha, Extremadura, Galicia, La Rioja, Madrid, Murcia and Valencia – had declared level 3 emergencies, placing responsibility for the response in the hands of the central government. He said schools in those areas would be open on Tuesday, but would not be offering regular classes.He said the situation across the country remained very “asymmetric” on Monday night, with some regions already having 90% of their power restored, while others had recovered less than 15%.Sánchez also advised non-essential workers to stay home on Tuesday if necessary.“It’s going to be a long night,” he said. “But we’re going to keep working to get back to normal as quickly as possible.”Explore more on these topicsSpainPortugalEuropeEnergy industrynewsShareReuse this content"

In the UK, a criminal handed a prison sentence of one year or more can be defined as having committed a “serious crime”.Officials said the planned changes will mean that anyone convicted of a crime and placed on the sex offender register will be categorised as having convicted a “particularly serious crime”, regardless of the length of sentence they receive.Home Office sources have not said how many more foreign national offenders may be removed from the UK as a result of the change. The department has conducted an impact assessment on the new policy which is yet to be released.According toofficial statistics, there were 451 foreign nationals serving sentences of less than 12 months in England and Wales at the end of March. There is no breakdown showing how many of those are sex offenders.Offenders who face removal could still attempt to claim a right to remain in the UK under the European convention on human rights, sources indicated. The new rule will also apply to foreign offenders who were convicted of sex offences abroad.Steve Valdez-Symonds, the programme director for refugee and migrant rights at Amnesty International UK, said the development was “an irresponsible approach to lawmaking that has long plagued immigration policy”.He added: “Rushing through late-stage amendments to major legislation means laws are made without the full scrutiny and care they demand. It risks creating injustice and dysfunction.“Excluding individuals from refugee protections without a proper, individualised assessment undermines fairness, hinders integration, and condemns people to live in limbo, unable to move forward with their lives.”The Home Office will also direct courts to reduce the time they take to consider appeals from asylum seekers in accommodation.The amendment will also set a 24-week target for first-tier immigration tribunals to decide on the appeals of those living in asylum seeker supported accommodation, or who are foreign national offenders, in a bid to cut the asylum backlog.Artificial intelligence will be used to support those processing asylum claims, the Home Office said, such as by summarising interview transcripts and accessing country advice. Using the technology could save case workers up to an hour per case, according to the department.Enver Solomon, the chief executive of the Refugee Council, welcomed efforts to speed up the appeals process, but said that extra funding would be required to make it work.He said: “A faster appeals process cannot be magicked up out of thin air and must not come at the cost of people’s access to justice. Previous efforts to speed up this process have often led to a bigger court backlog due to poor quality initial decisions.“The use of AI therefore must be carefully considered before potentially life or death decisions become a testing ground for the technology,” he said.Reform is on course to take hundreds of council seats and is ahead in the race for two metro mayoralties – Lincolnshire and Hull – as well as the Runcorn byelection, a constituency which Starmer has not yet visited.While much of the focus has been on the Tory response to the Farage threat, with Kemi Badenoch’s party expected to suffer a devastating night on Thursday, Labour insiders are also anxious about how they will perform against Reform in their post-industrial heartlands.There is some alarm on the backbenches over the government’s response to date, with MPs fearing the party’s position on issues is reached as a result of electoral considerations – such as migration, Europe and social issues.“We need to be careful about lurching to the right in response to Reform,” one MP said. “We can do better than that. We should be arguing for Labour values especially on immigration. If we want economic growth, legal migration has to play a part in that.”The number of migrants who have arrived in the UK after crossing the Channel this year has edged closer to 10,000, at the start of what is forecast to be the warmest week of 2025 so far.It emerged last year thata man who had carried out a chemical attack in Clapham, south London, had been granted asylum despite being a convicted sex offender and on the sex offender register.Abdul Ezedi, who doused his former girlfriend in alkaline before taking his own life, was granted asylum in 2020 by a judge who accepted that he was a Christian convert.He had been given a suspended sentence at Newcastle crown court on 9 January 2018 after pleading guilty to sexual assault and exposure and had been placed on the sex offender register for 10 years.Explore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumSex offenders registerLocal electionsReform UKLabourLocal politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

One concrete thing is that the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) have been involved in pushing for the Open to return to Trump-owned Turnberry.”Both the DCMS and Trump Turnberry declined to comment.Two other people briefed on conversations between the US president and Keir Starmer said Trump had asked the prime minister multiple times about hosting the Open at Turnberry, which the Trump Organization has owned since 2014.Trump has previously lobbied publicly to host the Open at the Ayrshire course, saying in 2023: “Everybody wants to see the Open championship here.”King Charles acknowledged the course’s importance to Trump whenhe wrote to him offering a visit to one of his Scottish estatesshould the president already be in the country visiting Turnberry.Hosting the Open could provide a welcome financial boost for SLC Turnberry, the course’s operating company, which is run by the president’s sons, Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. Last year the company lost £1.7m, having made £571,000 in the previous year – its only profit in 10 years.The R&A has a list of nine or 10 historic courses it would consider for hosting the Open, including famous venues such as St Andrews and Royal Birkdale. Turnberry is on that list, having hosted the championship in 2009. However golf experts point out that the event has grown substantially since then. While the 2009 Open attracted 123,000 people, the event at Royal Troon last year was attended by over 250,000.The R&A previously said it would not host the tournament at Turnberry in the wake of the January 6 attack by Trump supporters on the Capitol in 2021. Last November, the then head of the organisation, said he did not want “media noise” detracting from the game.Since then however the R&A has changed leadership. And in an apparent shift of position Mark Darbon, the new chief executive,said last weekhe would like to see the championship return to Turnberry “at some point”.Those briefed on the discussions between government officials and the R&A say they have mainly focused on the logistical challenges to hosting the Open at Turnberry. They said the main problems would be getting the sheer number of spectators in and out of the site by road, rail and air, given Turnberry is a two-and-a-half hour train trip from Glasgow, or a one-hour drive along a single A-road.Darbon said last week: “At Turnberry, there are definitely some logistical and commercial challenges that we face around the road, rail and accommodation infrastructure. We’re doing some feasibility work around what it would look like to return to that venue and the investment that it would require.”One ministertold the Financial Times earlier this yearthe venue would need “tens, or hundreds, of millions of pounds of investment” to make it easier to reach and to provide enough high-quality hotel accommodation in the area.A spokesperson for R&A said: “We regularly engage with government and local government regarding venues. We have explained the logistical challenges around Turnberry to the government and they are aware of the position.”Explore more on these topicsThe OpenDonald TrumpGolfLobbyingCivil serviceForeign policyScotlandnewsShareReuse this content"

The exemption for milk-based drinks was included because of concerns about calcium consumption, particularly among children.However, the Treasury said young people only get 3.5% of their calcium intake from such drinks, meaning “it is also likely that the health benefits do not justify the harms from excess sugar”.“By bringing milk-based drinks and milk substitute drinks into the SDIL, the government would introduce a tax incentive for manufacturers of these drinks to build on existing progress and further reduce sugar in their recipes,” it said.The Institute of Economic Affairs, a rightwing free-market thinktank, expressed concerns about the cost to consumers of the proposed changes.Children’s sugar consumption halved since tax announcement, study findsRead more“The sugar tax has been such a dramatic failure that it should be repealed, not expanded,” said Christopher Snowdon, head of lifestyle economics at the institute.“Sugar taxes have never worked anywhere. What happened to Starmer’s promise to not raise taxes on working people?”The government consultation on the plans will run from Monday until 21 July.Explore more on these topicsFood & drink industryMilkFoodLabourUltra-processed foodsObesitynewsShareReuse this content"

He has repeatedly referred to a “deep state” inIsraelthat he alleges seeks to thwart democratically elected leaders and undermine elected governments.The relationship between Netanyahu and Bar, a former special forces soldier who holds degrees from Tel Aviv and Harvard universities, deteriorated afterthe publication in March of a Shin Bet reporton the 7 October 2023 attacks by Hamas militants in southern Israel. The service admitted to mistakes but criticised policies of the Netanyahu government that it said had enabled Hamas to build up its strength in Gaza and catch Israel by surprise.4:35Could the West Bank become the next Gaza? – video explainerNetanyahu has never accepted any responsibility for Israel’s worst national security disaster, which killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and led to 251 being abducted and held hostage in Gaza. Eighteen months after the attack, many of the senior officials in post at the time have resigned or been forced out. Netanyahu appears unlikely to leave power before elections late next year and may stay on beyond then.Bar’s authorisation for Shin Bet to open two investigations into Netanyahu’s close aides, including one forallegedly taking payments from Qatar to promote its interests in Israelat the same time that Qatar was partly financing Hamas in Gaza, has been widely cited as a motive for his dismissal. Netanyahu is already facing a multitude of corruption charges in court, and political opponents have alleged the prime minister wanted to remove Bar in order to sabotage the investigations.Netanyahu has consistently denied any improper or ulterior reasons for firing Bar.“To this day, the reason for my firing is not clear to me,” Bar wrote in his supreme court affidavit. “But … it was not rooted in any professional metric, but out of an expectation by Netanyahu that I would be personally loyal to him.”Yair Lapid, Israel’s opposition leader, praised Bar’s decision and criticised Netanyahu. “Of those responsible for the greatest failure in the history of the country, only one remains, clinging to the chair,” Lapid said.The priority of Shin Bet is counter-terrorism, but the service also investigates espionage, manages security clearance for thousands of sensitive posts and has a legal duty to defend Israel’s democratic system.Bar took over the service in 2021, having been appointed by the then prime minister, Naftali Bennett, and was expected to serve the standard five-year term.Bar was one of the first senior security officials to accept responsibility for the many failures that led to the 2023 attacks, and made it clear he intended to resign.He has stayed on this long, associates and supporters said last month, to work towards the release of hostages still held by Hamas in Gaza and to protect Shin Bet from political manoeuvres.Explore more on these topicsIsraelBenjamin NetanyahuIsrael-Gaza warMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

It added that the sides would continue working “on how we can mitigate the impact of fluctuations in the global economic order”.However, the summit comes as the UK continues tariff negotiations with the US in the hope of carving out a special deal. Britain is facing a 10% tariff, while theEU faces 20%.Ahead of a meeting with the UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, last week, the leader of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, called for a drive to unlock investment for renewables in the North Sea.“We are friends. And we are Europeans. It means that we share interests and democratic values. And that we are ready to face global challenges as like-minded partners,” von der Leyen said after their meeting.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

So you’d expect us to be discussing a wide range of issues with the EU and obviously get an update on that at the summit.“The prime minister has spoken extensively recently about the benefits of free and open trade and the fact that we’re looking to strengthen alliances around the world to reduce barriers to trade, working with other economies.

He has not had to work too hard to sell himself to the crowds of people waiting to meet him on a sunny Monday afternoon inLondon– the queues stretched more than 50 yards.“From when I was very young, I always had a great passion for films, and I never really thought I could do it,” said 18-year-old actor Jack Foley, who was waiting in the queue to meet Goldblum. “Watching his films, seeing how big he is and how much of a great actor he is, really has pushed my career to be better. His music is class and he’s just an inspiration to everyone.”Rather than in the now-gentrified surrounds of Granary Square in King’s Cross, Foley had envisaged meeting Goldblum “in a parking lot”, adding: “You know where you’ve paid for your ticket and you’re just kind of walking up, you see Jeff Goldblum and you say, ‘oh, there’s Jeff Goldblum’?”View image in fullscreenJack Foley said Jeff Goldblum had inspired him to act.Photograph: Anna Gordon/The GuardianHe suggested the actor and musician had a quality that made him seem just like everyone else – as long as everyone else was a style icon and a Hollywood actor. “He’s the greatest person … he cares for people,” he said, adding that Goldblum was taking time to meet his fans.Goldblum was in the UK for the launch of his fourth album as well as playing several concert dates with the Mildred Snitzer Orchestra and meeting fans, declaring: “I love London, I loveEngland.”He appeared at a popup shop in Spiritland, a cafe, bar and radio studio near King’s Cross.View image in fullscreenPeach Richmond, a children’s book illustrator, said Goldblum gave off energy and joy.Photograph: Anna Gordon/The Guardian“Honestly, I just love him,” said Peach Richmond, a children’s book illustrator. “He got me out of a bit of a twisty-turny place when I was younger with his comedy. So that’s why he’s a bit of an idol for me, I think. It’s just his energy, it’s just his whole joy that he gives off. And he’s just himself – it’s what’s really inspires me to be who I am as well.”Goldblum is in the class of actor whose “energy” – or perhaps, more specifically, his distinctive delivery – has set him apart.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFilm WeeklyFree newsletterTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The actor’s performance in the 1993 Oscar-winning dinosaur film was in Barber’s “top three”.Sanny Hoskins, who runs a London events TikTok account, said she had never expected that a cafe a few doors down from an Indian restaurant would be the place she would meet one of her favourite actors. “You can connect with someone who you see through cinema, through TV, and get a face-to-face moment with them.

Keir Starmer has not even campaigned in the Runcorn and Helsby byelection, such is the expectation of defeat.“The opening image of this set of elections wasa Labour MP punching a swing voterin the face,” one party insider admitted. “Of course it’s going to be tough.”While much of the focus will inevitably be on how the Conservatives fare against Reform – with Kemi Badenoch’s team prepared for a brutal night – there is much anxiety in the Labour ranks about how to handle the threat from Farage.Some Labour MPs worry that No 10’s total focus on maintaining support among voters tempted by Reform means their party is in danger of lurching too far to the right on issues like immigration.They fear this could turn off more progressive voters who see legal migration as essential to economic growth and cultural enrichment, and recognise that much irregular migration comes from a place of desperation.AYouGov poll last weeksuggested that while 8% of those who voted Labour last year would now vote Reform, double that had shifted to the Lib Dems or Greens.But No 10 insiders are bullish, arguing that the day after the general election, Starmer said immigration would be one of his three priorities – along with the cost of living and the NHS – and that all their internal research shows that voters want the PM to get a grip on the issue.“We’re not putting an undue focus on migration,” one source said. “Voters from across the spectrum are worried about it. There’s a very visible breach of our border security, and that’s before you get to asylum costs and community cohesion.“We need to build public confidence in the government’s ability to control our borders. It is only by doing that that we get the space to talk about issues like youth visas or how we can respond to migration that arises from conflicts.”But government officials do acknowledge that many voters conflate legal and irregular migration, which is why the Office for National Statistics’upgrade of the Tories’ net migration figuresto almost 1 million last year was so damaging to public trust.“People are worried about both,” one official said. “Because small boats are such a visual and vivid phenomenon they end up being conflated with legal migration. On the doorstep, people don’t make a distinction between graduate visas and small boats.”Small boat crossings remain a huge political problem for Labour and the Tories – a wound that Farage continues to punch. The number ofpeople who have crossed the English Channel in small boats this yearhas exceeded 10,000, it emerged on Monday, an increase of about 40% compared with the same period last year.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Along with European allies, they say they have begun disrupting supply chains to make it harder for people-smugglers to get hold of boats in the first place.Improved relations between Paris and London have also lead to the French reinstating a dedicated policing unit, theCompagnie de Marche, from this Thursday, to help tackle the gangs. French police are also expected to have legal backing to intercept boats in shallow waters within weeks.There is also more work being done to shut down the hidden-market economy in the UK, which European allies argue is a major pull factor for economic migrants. There has been a 40% increase in illegal-working raids since the election.The government has also said it will soon publish a white paper on how it is bringing down legal migration levels, with Home Office insiders insisting the plans have been under way since November, rather than being a kneejerk reaction to the rise of Reform.“Our MPs are just going to have to deal with it,” said one government insider. “We promised we’d get to grips with immigration and we’re going to do our damnedest to do that.

What a horrific worldLucy ManganMon 28 Apr 2025 17.00 EDTShareWhat are we going to do with all the bad people? Like, really? What are we going to do with all the people whose stories hurl your mind back to a primitive state of lusting for vengeance, or make you long for a simpler time when the conclusion “They are evil” was considered a sufficient explanation and you could proceed with their punishment and society’s protection?Such are the thoughts that run through one’s mind when confronted with the likes of TheEssexMillionaire Murders. The two-part documentary tells the grimly shocking story of the 2023 murders of Carol and Stephen Baxter. They were found dead in their home in Mersea, Essex, by their daughter Ellena. There were no marks on the bodies, no injuries, no signs of a break-in. Carol had become increasingly ill since they moved there, apparently from Hashimoto’s disease, an autoimmune disorder, and husband Stephen had become her carer. Had it all become too much and they had then made a suicide- or murder-suicide pact? They had seemed a devoted couple and, though it was all mysterious, stranger things have happened: post-mortem and toxicology reports would, hopefully, offer answers.What unfolds from there is astonishing – courtesy of interviews with the investigating officers, who only just manage to maintain the veneer of professional detachment as their recounting of the extraordinary case goes on, and with Ellena, who speaks with the stark honesty of someone just coming out of the first shock of bereavement and still trying to come to terms with the incredible facts.View image in fullscreenDC Kerry Turner, DC Reuben Brame, DI Lydia George and DC Emily Larkin of Essex police who investigated the Baxters’ deathsPhotograph: ITVWe live in such a heavily recorded age that a vast amount of the Baxters’ story can be told using contemporary footage. We watch through the Baxters’ home security camera as Ellena gets out of her car on 9 April two years ago to visit her parents. They don’t answer the door so she goes out of shot to look through their windows. The audio picks up her screams. The bodycam footage of the police who attend shows her being comforted by neighbours and an officer gathering initial accounts from one who was particularly close to the family, Luke D’Wit, who tells them about Carol’s medications and health issues.There are the videos that the vivacious, charismatic Carol filmed of herself when she was well and running her own small business after a career as a maths teacher. And there are the videos from a few years later, recorded by her, and then by Stephen as her faculties decline, under the instruction of Dr Andrea Bowden, an expert offering bespoke treatment for Carol’s condition, advising her by email and texts from the US on the rules that she must follow if she wants to get better.In addition, there are messages between the family members, and between them and D’Wit – who has become like a son to them after starting as an IT consultant for the business – and between Carol and her WhatsApp support group with fellow Hashimoto’s sufferers.What do we do with bad people? With those who move through life seeking opportunities to torture others psychologicallyWhen a letter is found after her death among Carol’s papers that purports to change her will to leave the business to Ellena and D’Wit, the police wonder if they have just found a motive for murder. When the toxicology report reveals that the pair died of overdoses of drugs including fentanyl, Ellena and D’Wit are arrested. There is footage of that, too – Ellena mentally reeling, D’Wit preternaturally calm, chatting in the car to the officers and from his holding cell – and then of their respective interviews with the detectives.It is no spoiler, given her presence in the programme, to say that Ellena is cleared of any involvement in her parents’ death. What emerges around D’Wit is very different and makes you long for the banality of a mere financial motive.What do we do with bad people? With those who move through life seeking opportunities to torture others psychologically, to take advantage of the generous of heart and spirit, to maim the mind, weaken the body and eventually – when Stephen’s suspicions are roused – move on to murder? Who remain perfectly controlled throughout and even find, at least in one detective’s opinion, a way to deliver a last jolt of pain to the family at trial?There are no bells or whistles here – the makers have enough sense and respect to let the story and its sorrows stand alone. But what a world, my friends. What a world.Part 1 of The Essex Millionaire Murders aired on ITV1; part 2 is on 29 April.

Someone introduces themselves at a party and within seconds you’ve forgotten their name. You can’t remember where you parked the car. You’ve put your phone in the fridge. You can’t recall your granddaughter’s name. Your best friend dies and you keep forgetting they’re gone.Is it tiredness, distraction, or is it dementia? Most of us over a certain age will, at least once in our lives, do one of the above and worry we are losing our marbles.Four dementia and ageing experts give their advice about what’s normal, what’s concerning and when to seek medical advice.How much forgetfulness is part of normal ageing?We all get a little slower and many of us become a little more forgetful as we age, says scientia professorKaarin Anstey, a psychologist and director of the University of New South Wales Ageing Futures Institute in Sydney. It also happens even when we’re young and overtired.My life’s a mess. Will turning it into a game make everything better?Read moreOne common complaint is something being “on the tip of the tongue” but you just can’t remember it, she says, such as a person’s name or the name of a movie. Another is temporarily losing something such as a mobile phone or car keys. “That’s what we call normal experience in ageing; having the occasional experience of misplacing something,” she says.It’s also normal to find it harder to do things or that they take longer than they used to.Prof Amy Brodtmann, a neurologist and head of the Cognitive Health Initiative at Monash University in Melbourne, says our processing speed can slow with age, which can be particularly frustrating and alarming for people who are used to functioning at a high level. “I do see a lot of quite high-performing people in clinic who come in and say, ‘I can’t do what I used to do, I start doing six tasks at the same time and then I don’t get to the sixth one,’” Brodtmann says. “That is completely normal.”Should I worry if …I am always misplacing things?“If you have occasionally forgotten where you put your keys, or you wake up in the morning and you find that you’ve left the keys in the front door, that’s not necessarily a concern,” says geriatrician andassociate professor Michael Woodward, honorary medical adviser at Dementia Australia and head of dementia research at Heidelberg Repatriation hospital in Melbourne. “If it’s happening repeatedly, more frequently, or severe lapses like … leaving the stove on all night, leaving the kitchen tap running, things like that, they might be a bit more severe.”I forget a word, accidentally say the wrong one or call someone by someone else’s name?Problems with language can be an early warning sign of dementia, particularly if your speech starts to sound like “word salad”, saysDr Desmond Graham, a geriatrician and chief medical officer at Geriatric Care Australia in Sydney. “If you’re stumbling over your words or you get word-block or word-finding difficulties, that’s what makes me concerned,” Graham says.Woodward says mixing up the names of your children and grandchildren is OK, “But if you’re constantly forgetting the names of three of your four grandchildren, that’s a worry.”View image in fullscreenRepeating the same story within a single conversation can be an early warning sign.Photograph: DMP/Getty ImagesI keep getting lost?“One of the classical features of typical Alzheimer’s disease is people starting to actually get lost,” Brodtmann says. It’s normal to get lost driving somewhere new, but when people repeatedly have trouble navigating to familiar places, that can be a warning sign.“We call that topographic or geographic disorientation, and that is something that’s new because you should have those representations in your head,” she says.I forget important information I was recently told?If something has both valence – it is subjectively, emotionally important – and salience, meaning that we pay it a lot of attention, then forgetting about it can be a warning sign of dementia, Brodtmann says. “If someone’s best friend died two days ago and they knew about that, and you were having a conversation with them and you said to them, ‘That person’s died, when’s the funeral’, and they have no recollection of that actually occurring, that’s really concerning.”I repeat the same story to the same person?Repeating the same story within a single conversation can be an early warning sign, Woodward says. “So even in a single telephone conversation saying, ‘Oh, by the way did I tell you that John across the road has planted a … ’ and then, a few minutes later, ‘By the way, did I tell you that John across the road has planted a … ’ – that’s of concern,” he says.I walk into a room to do something and forget what it was?“That happens to everyone, and that can be more of a lapse of attention,” Anstey says. “People who have ADHD have that experience right across the life course.” It happens when you’re “not focusing on what you’re doing and starting on something, and then your mind switches to the next thing before you finish the first thing”.What else can cause forgetfulness?There are many reasons why otherwise cognitively healthy people might experience memory lapse, Anstey says. “Mothers with young children who’ve been up all night forget where they park their car … or can’t find their car keys, so those lapses of everyday cognition happen.”Some people experience “brain fog” after Covid-19 infection, and forgetfulness or memory issues can also be a side effect of chemotherapy or drugs to help sleep or relieve pain. Chronic stress can also have a negative effect particularly on short-term memory.View image in fullscreenLifestyle changes, such as exercise, can help stop mild cognitive decline from progressing.Photograph: MoMo Productions/Getty ImagesI’ve always been absent-minded. Am I more at risk?Being a forgetful or absent-minded person doesn’t necessarily put you more at risk of dementia, but it can make it harder to pick up in the early stages. “The challenge with mild cognitive impairment as well is that people classically always put mild cognitive impairment down to normal ageing,” Graham says.Brisk walking linked to lower risk of heart rhythm problems, study findsRead moreAt the same time, people who are really high functioning, but are in the early stages of more significant cognitive decline, can also be more challenging to diagnose, Anstey says. “They know they’ve declined and sense something is wrong, but because they’re still performing relatively well on cognitive testing they may not show any objective impairment early on, which means they may not meet clinical criteria and may not be diagnosed as early as someone else,” she says.Where should I turn if I’m concerned?Only around one in 10 people with early warning signs – what’s called mild cognitive impairment – will progress to dementia, Graham says. There are many interventions that can reduce the risk of that progression, such as improved diet and exercise, particularly if it’s picked up early.That’s why all the experts we spoke to recommended seeing a GP or preferably a geriatrician sooner rather than later, especially if friends, family or colleagues also start to notice changes.“Even if people don’t think it’s anything, or they think that they’re worrying about something that is just normal ageing … I strongly encourage them to go see a GP,” Graham says. “Ideally, if they can, get referred to a geriatrician.”Explore more on these topicsHealth & wellbeingAgeingAustralian lifestyleDementiafeaturesShareReuse this content"

On Thursday, those systems mostly restarted but M&S halted all orders on its website – which accounts for just over a third of clothing and homewares sales – amounting to almost £3.8m a day.As Patrick O’Brien, a retail analyst at GlobalData, says, cyber-attacks can have major consequences for businesses. “This is one of the most damaging cyber-attacks on a major UK retailer we have seen, the worst since Carpetright last year, which tipped an already very weak retailer into administration,” he says.M&S is a much stronger and larger business than Carpetright and not likely to be at risk of collapse, but the attack is having a direct impact on sales and as O’Brien says, the longer the disruption goes on, the more likely customers are to take their money elsewhere.M&S cyber-attack: when will orders be back, and is my data at risk?Read moreWhile most of the problems did not start until the later part of the Easter bank holiday, according to M&S, the attack cut off a run of buoyant trading. What M&S says was a separate incident also affected contactless payments in stores on the Saturday before Easter.Before then, sales had jumped almost 9% in the three months to 30 March, according to industry analysts Kantar, well above the wider fashion industry, as it continued to win over shoppers.M&S may derive some comfort from the fact that this is not happening during a peak trading period such as before Easter or Christmas, and Clive Black, M&S’s house broker at Shore Capital, said he expected the retailer to recoup any losses resulting from the attack via insurance.“The financial impact will be a zero sum game,” he says. “I don’t believe there will be enduring damage unless they don’t manage to fix it.”“There will be Mr & Mrs Angry from Tunbridge Wells but most people can see in the past decade that M&S has materially improved as a business and there will be some sympathy. This is not something it brought on itself but a malevolent force.”O’Brien agrees: “Customers are surprisingly forgiving.”Explore more on these topicsMarks & SpencerRetail industryCybercrimeanalysisShareReuse this content"

Especially her closest friends. They know what’s good for them. Sometimes absence is an act of friendship. Intimacy by proxy.Mornings are when Kemi is at her worst. Up at 6.30am, checking her phone for the latest culture war. Six double espressos. Then she’s ready to get out of bed. Anyone who crosses her path gets swatted away. Don’t even think of offering her a granola bar. An hour of bog standard policing to follow. Making sure the right people go to the right toilet. Ready to pick an argument with anyone.So it was a shock to find KemiKaze on the 8.15am sofa slot on Good Morning Britain. Which of her minders had let her loose at that time of day? It was even more of a shock to discover that she was almost charming. Non-combative, even. You wouldn’t go so far as saying Kemi was friendly. She hasn’t had a personality transplant. Her private hell is other people. But she didn’t hit anyone. Didn’t start a fight. Was more or less human.She had taken the job of leader of the Conservative party in the belief she could make a difference. That she was the one who could halt the party’s decline. Nearly six months on and Kemi was nearly out of ideas. Nothing she had tried had worked. Turned out that voters weren’t prepared to forgive the Tories quite so quickly. Their eyes didn’t light up at the sound of toxic arguments. They actually just wanted to feel as if things were getting better. When they weren’t.Now she could sense her time was running out.Robert Jenrickwas positioning himself in the wings. Openly campaigning to replace her. Not even polite enough to be subtle about it. You know what? Let him try. Let’s see if he can come up with any ideas that the country will reject. She had had a go. No one could take “leader of the opposition” off her CV. And in truth, she had never really been up for it. You’d need to be a madwoman to take on a job for which you had been set up to fail.GMB presenter Susanna Reid started off by talking about potential coalitions between the Tories and Reform. How nervous are you about notching up hundreds of losses? Given that Kemi appeared to be nodding off already, it was no surprise that she wasn’t that bothered at all.When everything bad already appears to have happened, you get a bit blase about local election results. She had already priced in the certainty the Tories were going to have a disastrous Thursday. Bring it on. It wasn’t personal. The voters didn’t hate her. Well, not much. They just hated theConservativesa whole lot more.Kemi shrugged as Susanna tried to tease something – anything – out of her. Please, just say something, her eyes begged. It’s how interviews work. She asks the questions and then Kemi gives an answer. Anything would do. Just the structure of a conversation would be a start.“We are fighting every seat,” said KemiKaze eventually. Technically this is true. She just didn’t specify how strongly the Tories would be fighting. Then came the expectation management. Four years ago the Conservatives had been riding high in the polls. Now they were tanking hideously. She tried to correct herself. This wasn’t about the opinion polls – it had just been a coincidence the Tories had done so well in 2021. And it certainly wasn’t about immigration. It was all about who you trusted to run local services. Dream on. If that was the case, no one would be voting Reform.Now it was Ed Balls’s turn. He too wanted to know how Kemi was feeling. Are you OK? Are you enjoying yourself? It was all going a bit Amol Rajan on University Challenge. For a moment, Kemi almost rallied. How do you think I’m feeling? I’m feeling like shit. People told me not to take the job and they were right. The only crumb of comfort was the counterfactual notion that the Tories might have been doing even worse without her.Kemi did spark vaguely to life when asked about the supreme court ruling on biological sex. “I was right all along,” she yelled, punching the air. As far as she was concerned, trans people could use a disabled toilet. And if there wasn’t one anywhere near they could just hang on till they got home.The interview ended with Ed mentioning the J word. Why was she putting up with Jenrick so obviously campaigning against her? Because she didn’t care. He would fail. Just like she had. Good luck to him. Honest Bob was a loyal member of her team. Inasmuch as anyone in her team was loyal. Never mind. It would all be over soon.MeanwhileKeir Starmerwas campaigning in the north-west. Though not in Runcorn where a byelection will be held. Nothing could better show just how desperate the prime minister is to hold on to Runcorn than his absence from it. He knows how unpopular he is. Were he to campaign in the constituency, he would be in danger of losing votes. Best leave the hard graft to people on the ground who can keep their distance from the Labour centre.It’s election week.

Unlike those in cities from Boston to London toTokyo, the longstanding New York map hews fairly closely to the image of the city aboveground.Central Park is clearly depicted, as are the individual bodies of water within it; you can see the shape of each borough and the rivers and ocean framing them. Overlaid across it all is a tangled web of subway lines, daunting to the first-time visitor – especially when it comes to distinguishing between local and express trains.For the first time in nearly 50 years, that is changing. This month, the city’s Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA) revealed a new map – or, perhaps more properly,a new diagram– that lays out the system more geometrically.The outlines of the boroughs are still there, but far more simplified. Central Park has been reduced to a greenish square. The subway lines themselves, meanwhile, are far bolder and clearer, with separate paths shown for each train. The overlapping A, C and E trains, for instance, once shared a single blue line with tiny letters denoting which train stopped where. Now they form a thick blue trio that branches out when the lines separate.View image in fullscreenThe new subway map.Photograph: Marc A Hermann/MTAAccording to the MTA, the new diagram, the first major overhaul since 1979, seeks to simplify the image while offering “the most essential travel information in an easily readable, bright, bold, and orderly manner”. It hearkens back to adivisive predecessor: Massimo Vignelli’s 1972 diagram, known as the Unimark map, which firmly prioritized legibility for subway riders over an accurate representation of the New York landscape. Vignelli is something of a design hero, havinghelped shape the whole lookof the subway system. But many New Yorkers hated his map, and it was gone by 1979, replaced by an early version of the Tauranac/Hertz map – the one you know if you visited the city before 2 April.Still, the Unimark map is far closer to the feel of many other cities’ subway diagrams, which offer virtually no sense of what a city actually looks like. London’s Tube map, designed in the 1930s by Harry Beck – whomVignelli calledthe “father of all contemporary kinds of subway maps” – is known for its beauty and its total irrelevance to reality. As Bill Bryson has pointed out, a touristreading Beck’s mapand trying to get from Bank to Mansion House could ride two lines and six stops – or walk 200ft down the street.View image in fullscreenThe 1972 New York city subway map designed by graphic artist Massimo Vignelli.Photograph: Associated PressSo if these diagrams work perfectly well elsewhere, why were New Yorkers so frustrated with Vignelli’s attempt? According to the writer and mapmaker Jake Berman, the author ofThe Lost Subways of North America: A Cartographic Guide to the Past, Present and What Might Have Been, the answer lies in part in the grid layout of most Manhattan streets.If you want to go from 51st Street and Sixth Avenue to 42nd and Fifth, it’s easy to calculate that you need to go nine blocks downtown and one block east. That creates “a unique challenge for a cartographer trying to illustrateNew York, because everybody knows where everything is”, Berman says.“When you’re designing a transit map, the standard way, as in London or Madrid or Paris, is to distort the geography so that the transit network makes sense and it straightens out the spaghetti of the subway line into something intelligible.” In many cities, the streets are so confusing that it doesn’t matter if the subway diagram doesn’t match. But in New York, “if you show Second Avenue to the east of First Avenue, you’re going to look at the map and say: ‘What is this?’”On top of all that, some disliked the Unimark map’s modern look and its colors. “I showed it to my mom and she said: ‘Why is the water brown?’” Berman says.But Vignelli’s wasn’t the first New York subway map to opt for the diagrammatic approach. In fact, the New York City Transit Authority’s first map, which came out in 1958, did the same, according to Jodi Shapiro, the curator of the New York Transit Museum, a self-sustaining division of the MTA. (Maps existed before then, but they were largely the domain of third-party companies.) The map, Shapiro says, is “always a work in progress”, a “living document”. While it’s been decades since a major change, the existing map was constantly being tweaked. And the new map didn’t suddenly spring to life – it was the product of a decade of work, Shapiro says. “There’s always been two sides of thinking about which is a better map for New York? Is it a diagram, or is it an actual geographic map?”View image in fullscreenPassengers look at the subway map at the Union Square subway station on 23 December 2005, in New York, New York.Photograph: Mary Altaffer/APShe surmises that the designers of the new version sought to pull the best ideas from both versions. Will New Yorkers like it? Shapiro expects it to be divisive. “Old ideas die very, very hard in New York, especially in the transit system,” Shapiro says.Indeed, one of the first passengers to lay eyes on the design gave the New York Times a middling review: “Meh.” But some New York rail fans have been enthusiastic: “I like it. Looks like a map made out of multicolored computer wires,”wrote oneReddit user. “Love that the Vignelli map is back,”wrote another.Athird said: “Vignelli-style diagram is better for understanding how to navigate from one station to another, but worse for understanding where stations are relative to real-world destinations … Maybe that’s okay. People don’t navigate the same way in 2025 that they did in 1979.”Berman echoed that point: the shift may mean New York is ready for the kind of map it dismissed in the 70s. Today, “everyone has Google Maps on their phone so they can adjust once they’ve come above ground,” Berman says. And “on the design front, at least the water is blue and the parks are green.” It might also help that the Vignelli map has achieved a quasi-legendary status, having earned aplace in New York’s Museum of Modern Art.Still, this is New York, so the map is bound to take some getting used to. “New Yorkers will complain about anything. It’s the municipal sport,” Berman says.Shapiro agrees. “New Yorkers are kind of not cool with change at the outset – for the first couple of days, everybody is up in arms,” whether the change is to subway maps or Nathan’s french fries. But in the end, “does it help people get to where they want to go? If it does that job, then it’s a success, no matter what you think of the aesthetics.”Explore more on these topicsNew YorkDesignCity transportMapsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The idea of touching one, picking one up, I find very off-putting.”In October 2021 he was in Santa Fe, New Mexico, on the set of his sixth feature, the western Rust, when a gun being held by the film’s star,Alec Baldwin, was discharged accidentally during rehearsals. The weapon should have been loaded with blanks but a live round had found its way into the chamber. The movie’s Ukrainian cinematographer Halyna Hutchins was fatally wounded. Souza was hit in the shoulder by the same bullet that killed her.I didn’t watch the Baldwins’ reality show. I was too busy hitting myself in the face with a frying pan that nightDid he think he might die? “I don’t remember what was going through my head. One of the stranger aspects is that it felt like I was lying there for five minutes. Apparently, it was half an hour.” Hutchins was taken away by helicopter, Souza in an ambulance. “I knew I could breathe but I didn’t know what to expect until I got to the hospital.”In the aftermath, there was blame-slinging, multiple criminal cases and an official report that described the film’s producers as indifferent to gun safety. A settlement was paid by Baldwin to Hutchins’ family. Her widower Matthew Hutchins confirmed that all parties “believe Halyna’s death was a terrible accident”.View image in fullscreen‘I was a mess’ … director Joel Souza.Photograph: Czarek Sokołowski/APAt the trial last summer, a charge of involuntary manslaughter against Baldwin was dismissed when it emerged that the prosecution had mishandled evidence. But the charge stuck in the case of the film’s prop armourer Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, who is serving an 18-month prison sentence. Dave Halls, assistant director on Rust, accepted a plea bargain and was convicted of negligent use of a firearm.Even before Baldwin walked free, something unexpected had happened: 18 months after Hutchins’ death, the film resumed shooting. “The family wanted it completed,” explains Souza. “I’d been repelled by the thought of going back, but now it started to appeal. And I couldn’t live with the idea of someone else doing it.”During the first round of filming in 2021, there were disagreements with Baldwin over the nature of his character. One of Souza’s stipulations for returning was that everyone on set had to fall in line with his vision. “It’s not that I’m standing there with my foot on anybody’s neck,” he says. “But there were fights I needed not to have. That was the only way I could get through this.”And so he found himself back on the set of Rust, directing the actor who had shot him in the shoulder. “I was a mess going in and a mess coming out. The crew carried me through. My family carried me through. Emotionally, I was all over the map.”And physically? “Sometimes it’s fine. Sometimes it catches on fire. The physical therapist at the time said, ‘We’re going to get you back to 70% range of motion.’ I looked shocked. They were like, ‘You’re almost 50. Don’t kid yourself you had 100% to start with.’” For the first and only time in our long conversation, he allows himself a smile.Two and a half years on from the accident, Rust is about to be released. It’s a solid piece of work, gorgeously photographed by Hutchins and Bianca Cline, the latter shooting the 50% or so of scenes that hadn’t been completed, as well as the ones that needed to be reshot as some of the original actors were no longer available.Souza had insisted from the start on a female cinematographer, which is how he met Hutchins. “The agencies throw male candidates at you, but I know there are a lot of women coming out of the American Film Institute. Then somebody told me, ‘Women can’t shoot westerns.’ And I thought, ‘Fuck you. I’m going to stick that up your ass andonlylook at women.’”After the accident, word got around that Rust had been some tawdry enterprise all along. “I heard people say, ‘Oh, it’s this straight-to-video geezer-teaser piece-of-crap.’ And it wasn’t. Did people think someone as talented as Halyna would waste her time on that?” With its themes of guilt and atonement, Rust is more like a kid brother to Clint Eastwood’s Unforgiven. Baldwin gives a troubled performance as grizzled outlaw Harland Rust – and actually it is possible to watch the movie without seeing tragedy in every frame.View image in fullscreenTop billing … Halyna Hutchins on the set of Rust.Photograph: Felipe OrozcoNot that there aren’t moments to make one wince. Souza knew from the outset that he would not include the scene that Baldwin was rehearsing when the fatal shot was fired, but there is only so much that could be expunged without destroying the film’s essence. Although it is no surprise that a western should contain guns and shootouts, some of the echoes in Rust are uncanny. The entire plot hinges, for instance, on an accidental shooting: this is how the orphaned teenager Lucas, played by Patrick Scott McDermott, ends up in prison. Later, when Rust busts him out, there is much brooding over a rifle that has been handed down through the generations. “It’s ruined the life of almost anyone it’s ever come across,” the kid says.Souza sighs at this. “The movie is about what it’s about: the consequences of violence. There’s a real anti-gun aspect to it.”There’s still this feeling in the film industry that it could never happen to themHe may have been able to save Rust but he had no control over what Baldwin did next. The actor attracted derision earlier this year for his ill-timed reality TV show, which showed him and his family soldiering on in extreme luxury.This paper calledThe Baldwins “unnecessary” and “distasteful”. Souza didn’t watch it. “I think I was busy hitting myself in the face with a frying pan that night,” he says.Last summer, he said of Baldwin: “We’re not friends. We’re not enemies. There’s no relationship.” Today, he uses some of the same language when I ask about Gutierrez-Reed, the jailed prop armourer. “There is no relationship,” he shrugs. “I think we might have had a couple of conversations first time around. She seemed nice enough. I just feel terrible for everybody. There can be no joy taken in someone going to jail.”Inevitably, he still goes over that October day in his head. “You think about the chain of events that started that morning. Bad decision after bad decision was made.” As the film’s writer-director, is there anything he wishes he could do over? “Talk about the butterfly effect,” he says. “I wish I never wrote the damn movie.”View image in fullscreenInvestigators seal off the prop cart after the on-set accident.Photograph: Santa Fe County Sheriff’s Office/AFP/Getty ImagesBut he did. And now it’s finally out there, with the addition of some significant nods to Hutchins. She is second-billed after him in the end credits: unheard of for a cinematographer, and likely a contravention of guild rules. “Let some son of a bitch come say a word about that,” Souza says, “and I’ll fight him in the street!” So far, no one has.The film is also dedicated to Hutchins, and features her name in the credits in Ukrainian as well as in English. “I wanted to include that for her mother,” says Souza. The dedication is accompanied by a line that became a mantra for Hutchins after setting up every shot: “How can we make it better?”Souza says: “She was asking, ‘How can we improve this shot?’ But I found it to be even more profound than that. If you apply ‘How can we make it better?’ to every aspect of life, one small act at a time, then maybe this place can finally live up to its potential and its purpose.” In the context of Rust, the question takes on a promise of healing: an attempt to draw something positive from the horror of what happened.Unfortunately, there are signs that the accident has done little to change the industry. “You’ll talk to people who have been on other sets and they say it’s on their minds,” says Souza. “But there’s also this feeling that it could never happen to them. They say, ‘Sometimes a hurricane lands where it lands.’”Last year he met a veteran cinematographer who told him about a film set in Los Angeles where live ammo was recently discovered. “It had made its way from the truck and through the initial check and they only caught it at the absolute last second. He said this was a major studio shoot. He told me, ‘People aren’t changing. They all feel like you guys were just unlucky.’”Rust is released in the US on 2 May. A UK release is yet to be confirmed.Explore more on these topicsFilmRust film set shootingAlec BaldwinWesternsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

They’ll be ready to tackle the26 miles and 385 yards– and take a daunting step into the unknown. Or more like 50,000 steps.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.I remember my first marathon in Paris, in 2009. It’s nervy; you’ve suffered your way through the odd 20-mile training run, but what lies beyond that remains a mystery. Will I hit the wall? Will my body cope? What if I pee myself? So many questions, so few guarantees. The only certainty: even if you’replanning to do some jeffing, at some point it’s going to hurt.Adrift in that sea of uncertainty, our instinct to control kicks in. We turn to the one thing in our power: running kit. Cue endless hours of fussing and second-guessing yourself over your choice of race-day gear. What I call “kit pratting”.From socks to sunglasses, it’s undoubtedly important to find what works for you and assemble a race-day suit of armour. But, as a novice, it’s easy to overcomplicate things and become the marathon incarnation of an end-of-world prepper, trying to be ready for all eventualities, envisaging Armageddon at mile 24.I’m here to tell you to relax. It’s all going to be OK. This April in London was my 60th marathon and, since that first fretful plod around the streets of Paris, I’ve learned that simplicity is the way to go when it comes to marathon kit.Less is definitely moreView image in fullscreenFor beginners, comfort trumps speed when it comes to shoes.Photograph: caronwatson/Getty ImagesLess kit means fewer potential malfunctions. For example, a hydration vest offers the security of water on tap, but adds weight and increases your risk of chafing. There’s plenty of water on the course, so can you do without it?You can see what else I recommend in myguide to running kit for marathon first-timers. If, though, I had to pick only a handful of mission-critical items,running shoes, running socks, undies and lube would top the list. This may sound more like a naughty weekend than a 42-kilometre slog through the urban sprawl, but hear me out.For beginners, comfort trumps speed when it comes to shoes. Be honest with yourself: will those minimalcarbon race shoesreally be a better option than a reliable workhorse to cushion you through three to six hours on your feet?You’ll also be thankful for a good pair of running socks that stay dry, don’t bunch or induce blisters. Use the ones you wore on your long training runs if they worked. After all, happy feet = happy runner.We also need to talk about your soft bits. Nothing derails a race strategy like painful chafing.

So I borrowed a pen and paper, sat down and started writing’Interviews byHenry YatesMon 28 Apr 2025 09.38 EDTLast modified on Mon 28 Apr 2025 12.57 EDTShareMark Knopfler, guitar/vocals/writerI was in an appliance shop in New York and there was a big bonehead in there delivering gear. All the TVs were tuned to MTV and I overheard this guy sounding off about the rock stars on the screens. He had an audience of one – the junior at the store – and some of his lines were just too good to be true.Things like: “That little motherfucker’s got his own jet airplane!” And: “He’s banging on the bongos like a chimpanzee!” And: “That ain’t working!” That was just the way he spoke – and in that New York accent too. The bells were going off in my head but I didn’t have a pen with me, so I borrowed one, got a bit of paper and I actually sat down in the window display area of the store and started writing out the lines to Money for Nothing as he said them.We recorded on Montserrat and I said: 'Wouldn’t it be great if Sting could sing?' And someone said: 'He’s on the beach!'The guitar lick is just a stomp, a two-fingered boogie. It comes from the clawhammer style and it’s got its own rhythm. It was just fun to do. But there were a whole bunch of fortunate incidents that collided with each other to create the song. For instance, I’d seen the Police on the MTV channel saying the phrase: “I want my MTV.” But they also had a song called Don’t Stand So Close to Me, so I put “I want my MTV” to that melody and included it at the start.While we were recording the Brothers in Arms album at Air Studios on Montserrat, I remember thinking: “Wouldn’t it be great if I could ask Sting to sing that line?” We were on this tiny speck in the middle of the ocean but suddenly someone said: “Sting’s here on holiday! He’s on the beach!” So he came up to the studio and when he walked in, the first thing he said was: “What’s wrong?” I said: “What do you mean?” And he said: “Nobody’s fighting …” [unlike in the Police].View image in fullscreenThe Money for Nothing sleeve artwork.Photograph: AlamyBrothers in Arms was huge. So many people wanted to see the band live. After we played Live Aid at Wembley Stadium, we ran across the car park to Wembley Arena where we were playing that night. In fact, one of the reasons why it felt like I had to scale things back was going into catering and not recognising the crew. That’s when I realised the size of it.John Illsley, bassWe’d already had four successful albums, so the expectations for Brothers in Arms were pretty high. Thankfully Mark’s writing was sharp as a tack. At that point, we’d convene in a mews house in west London, just with guitars, an acoustic bass and a keyboard, and run through material Mark had been working on.The Money for Nothing chords and lyrics were already there – and obviously there was Mark’s riff, which was pretty extraordinary. It’s funny: when other guitarists try that riff, they play all the right notes but don’t get the feel. We took our time, and it went from being aMark Knopflersong to a Dire Straits song. I played the bass in a simple way, happily sitting on the chords, putting down that engine room.Its title is ironic, because we’d been working solidly for years to get to that point. But everybody viewed us from the outside. Like: “Oh, look at them, that ain’t working, that’s just money for nothing – and they get the chicks thrown in for free.” But it was a bit like Picasso, when he’d do a quick drawing for someone and people would say: “That only took you 10 seconds.” And he’d say: “No, it took me 40 years.”View image in fullscreen‘We called it a day’ … the band with John Illsley, left.Photograph: Ilpo Musto/ShutterstockBrothers in Arms was the first record we’d made with Guy Fletcher, who was a very technical musician. He knew how to work these modern keyboards, while Alan Clark was a wonderful piano player. The two of them created that Money for Nothing intro, and Terry Williams played the most explosive drum solo I’ve ever heard. Then the riff comes in. The guitar tone you hear on the record happened by accident: a microphone got knocked to the floor in front of the speaker and it changed the sound completely.Money for Nothing wasNo 1 in Americawhile Brothers in Arms wasNo 1 on the US album chartat the same time. We really enjoyed that success, but the fame … not so much. After the tour, there was a definite feeling we had to put this to bed. We reconvened for On Every Street in 1991 and that tour was physically and mentally exhausting. Mark had definitely had enough. For everybody’s sanity – but mostly his – we called it a day. But I honestly still enjoy playing Money for Nothing as much now as I did then. A good song is like a good picture – it never fades.Dire Straits’ Brothers in Arms (40th Anniversary Edition) is released on 16 May on LP, CD and Blu-Ray.

You come out of a stubby 1930s entrance hall that must have been cute once, right on to a dual carriageway. There’s a hotel on the other side of the road, and a tourist will most likely approach you, asking how she’s supposed to cross, and your answer will be just a sub-verbal collapse into nothingness. There is no obvious way to cross the road. This place was built for cars, and if you’re not a car, you’re stuck in a tube station now. There is actually an underpass, but that’s no excuse for dystopian urban planning.I was there helping the Stop Trump Coalition make a video before theUS president’s state visit, whenever that might be, and they were there to seeTesla Takedown, which is not as antagonistic as it sounds, just a score of people, one dressed as a shark for some reason, holding signs that said: “Honk if you hate billionaires.” Tesla drivers were honking as they drove into the showroom.

An ambulance put its siren on. Was this a movement building? “The feedback mechanism of a honk is quite ephemeral, isn’t it?” said an anthropologist who had declined to be interviewed. But hah, he shouldn’t have kept talking to me.It was the smallest protest I’d ever seen, unless you count the Prettiest Staffy in Lewisham beauty pageant, organised by someone to low-key protest against the vilification of staffordshire bull terriers.

Just as anti-liberal powers outside the west are becoming stronger than ever, the assault on everything we stand for has been joined by the United States. Against this massed onslaught of anti-liberal nationalists we need a determined fightback of liberal internationalists.Canada’s election this weekcan contribute a strong mounted brigade.A core insight of liberalism is that, if people are to live together well in conditions of freedom, power always needs to be dispersed, cross-examined and controlled. Faced with the raw, bullying assertion of might, whether from Washington, Moscow or Beijing, we now have to create countervailing concentrations of power. In the long history of liberalism, a free press, the law, labour unions, a business community kept separate from political power, NGOs, truth-seeking institutions such as universities, civil resistance, multilateral organisations and international alliances have all served – alongside multiparty politics and regular free and fair elections – to constrain themen who would be kings.In rallying everyone who believes in equal individual liberty to this fight, we liberals have a problem of our own making. Policies associated in many people’s minds with liberalism over the last 40 years have themselves fed the reservoirs of popular discontent from whichnationalist populistscontinue to draw support. Neoliberalism, hypercharged through a globalised financialised capitalism, has led to levels of inequality not seen for a hundred years. An identity politics intended to remedy the historic disadvantages of selected minorities has left many other members of our societies – especially white, male, working and middle class – feeling themselves culturally as well as economically neglected. Both these approaches reneged on liberalism’s central promise, lucidly summarised by the philosopher Ronald Dworkin as “equal respect and concern” for all.Neoliberalism has also turned the world’s most powerful democracy into something very close to oligarchy. The separation of private wealth and public power – a precious and fragile innovation of modern liberal democracy – has been reversed. Insatiable plutocrats such as Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerbergare now supportersof Donald Trump’s political power, while he promotes his own and his rich pals’ economic interests. With the help of the media and platforms the plutocrats control, Trump persuades many ordinary Americans that their suffering is entirely due to foreigners (immigrants, China), while in reality it is more likely to be the fault of people such as Musk, Bezos and Zuckerberg.So we have to fight simultaneously on two fronts: with the enemies of liberalism and the problems created by liberalism itself. Unity will be strength. If we each try to negotiate separately with the bullies, be they in Washington, Moscow or Beijing, they will pick us off one by one.These coalitions of counter-power will be composed of states, but also of civil society actors and active citizens. At least half the population of the United States is with us. Electoral authoritarian states such as Turkey and Hungary also have lots of would-be-free citizens. The world’s largest example of applied liberal internationalism, the 27-country European Union, will be crucial to the fightback. So will major individual democracies including Britain, Canada, Japan and Australia.We need to do many things at once. Promoting free trade against Trumpian beggar-thy-neighbour protectionism is an obvious starting point. It’s also easier said than done, since mutually beneficial trading arrangements take time to craft. Yet there are some accessible immediate wins. A trade agreement between the EU and the Mercosur group of Latin American states only awaits ratification by all relevant parties. Britain and the EU should be more ambitious at their upcoming summit on 19 May. The EU doesn’t need anyone else’s involvement for it to create a single digital space and unified capital markets, nor to build up European defence industries, which would also be a neo-Keynesian economic stimulus.The monopolistic platforms and mega-wealth of the American oligarchs are a danger to all other countries. If the EU were prepared to use its regulatory superpower, coordinated with the efforts of other liberal democracies, we could do more to curb them. But regulation and taxation alone are not enough.Whether in Europe,Canada, Australia or Japan, our entire digital infrastructure is effectively American. Imagine one day your iPhone and iPad stopped working, along with your cloud provider, Google, Amazon, Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Twitter (AKA X-itter). What would be left? TikTok! “And Bluesky”, you may add, referencing the liberal social platform of choice. But that too is American. This is not only about infrastructure. It’s about how we create the digital public sphere essential for the future of liberal democracy.Civil society initiatives can also help. Why, for example, haven’t we already seen a major statement of solidarity withembattled US universitiesfrom universities across the liberal world?So can consumer protests. The impact of a largely spontaneous boycott of Tesla cars is pushing Musk to return to his business activity, cutting the leisure time he can spend on vandalising his country’s administrative state. Canadians now have the BuyBeaver app on their phones, sothey can avoid US-made goods. (I hope they boycott Russian ones too.)It’s also a matter of fighting style. Anti-liberal nationalists use the bludgeon, we the rapier. When they go low, we go high. When they go ape, we stay cool. When they lie through their teeth, we stand by the facts.In foreign policy, the most urgent challenge is to save Ukraine, which Trump isthrowing under the bus. The fact that he is pressing the Ukrainians to abandon even their legal claim to Crimea being part of Ukrainian sovereign territory shows how supporting Ukraine is now essential to defending fundamental principles of liberal international order.What emerges after this hurricane will not be the same as before. It will be transformed both by us learning from our own mistakes, so as to build back better, and by the revolutionary impact of Trump. A liberal democratic constellation that is not fundamentally secured by the US “liberal leviathan”, in the Princeton scholar John Ikenberry’s striking phrase, will be something very different from what we knew between 1945 and 2025.Even the geography will change. Canada, for example, which once seemed – in the nicest possible way – somewhat peripheral to world affairs, comfortably tucked up there between a friendly America and a frozen Arctic, now suddenly looks like a frontline state. One of the world’s most liberal countries is, beside Ukraine, one of the most directly threatened by Trump’s anti-liberal assault. And the thawing Arctic is a major new theatre of international competition. Fortunately,it looks as if Canadais going to have a government that is not just Liberal in name but also combatively liberal in nature.A quarter-century ago, when the United States was attacked by Islamist terrorists on 11 September 2001, the editor of Le Monde wrote a famous banner headline: “We are all Americans!” Today, friends of liberty the world over should say: “We are all Canadians!”Timothy Garton Ash is a historian, political writer and Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsUS foreign policyOpinionCanadaUS politicsEuropeTrump administrationcommentShareReuse this content"

Being a “low-IQ individual” is a standard insult in the president’s repertoire, and being “high-IQ” is an equally standard form of praise for those on the tech right. Yet in the drive for US supremacy in artificial intelligence – signalled by the $500bn (£375bn)Stargate project announcementin the White House and an executive order tointegrateAI into public education, beginning in kindergarten – there is a hidden irony. If their vision for our economic future is realised, IQ in the sense that they value will lose its meaning.IQ testing arose at a time when the US and other industrialised nations were worried about the health of their populations. Recruitment campaigns for the Boer war in the UK, and then the first world war elsewhere, showed male populations that were unhealthier than their fathers’ generation. Industrial work seemed to be triggering what looked like a process of degeneration, with a fearful endpoint in the subterranean Morlocks of HG Wells’s classic novella, The Time Machine. Intelligence tests were a way to salvage the diamonds from the rough and find a new officer class – and later a new elite – to guide mass society from the slough of despond into a braver future.When manufacturing still ruled in the US, IQ was valued as a way of measuring educational outcomes, but arguably it was not until the breakthrough of the information economy in the 1980s and 90s that knowledge workers became indisputably the vanguard of future prosperity. It is no coincidence that IQ talk surged in the 1990s, first through Charles Murray and Richard Herrnstein’s infamous book, The Bell Curve, which suggested there were long-term and insurmountable gaps in IQ between racial groups, and second, more subtly through gifted and talented search programmes in the US that found kids and plucked them from public schools into supercharged summer programmes for the bright.One such person was Curtis Yarvin, the middle-aged software engineer and amateur political theorist who hasdrawnattentionfor his techno-monarchistphilosophyand whose work has beenpositively citedby the US vice-president, JD Vance. As a youngster, Yarvin was part of Julian Stanley’s Center for Talented Youth. From the early 2000s to the present, he has been a consistent advocate for the importance of IQ as a measure of human worth. In the late 2000s, as an exponent of what came to be called the Dark Enlightenment, or “neo-reaction”, he suggested IQ tests could be used to disqualify voters in post-apartheid South Africa.Yarvin’s IQ fetishism was an organic outgrowth of the intellectual subculture of Silicon Valley. People who manipulated symbols and wrote code all day not surprisingly put special stock into the “general intelligence” measured by IQ, which gauged the proximity of minds to computers defined by logic, memory and processing speed.IQ fetishism had a history in the valley; one of the pioneers of the need to take eugenic measures to increase IQ was William Shockley, the inventor of the transistor (the building block of computer chips), who proposed that people with an IQ below the average of 100 should be given$1,000 per IQ pointto sterilise themselves. In 2014, the American tech billionaire Peter Thielsaidthe problem with the Republican party was that too many of its leaders were “lower IQ” compared with those in the Democratic party. IQ was also a common focus of discussion on the popular blog Slate Star Codex and elsewhere in the so-called “rationalist” community.All of this would have remained a quirky symptom of San Francisco Bay Area chatboards were it not for the recent alliance between the world of the tech right and the governing party in Washington DC. The idea that intelligence is hardwired and resistant to early intervention or improvement through state programmes – that IQ is meaningful and real – brings us closer to what Murray and Herrnstein were advocating for in The Bell Curve in the 1990s, what they called “living with inequality”.The US Department of Education was set up in 1980 on a premise opposite to that of The Bell Curve. It worked on the belief that early interventions are crucial for brain development and that measuring outcomes was necessary to fine-tune interventions so that educational testing could produce more even results across the US. This department is in the process of being dismantled by Elon Musk’s “department of government efficiency”, with the former World Wrestling Entertainment chief executive Linda McMahon promising to complete the task. Musk, like Trump, frequently refers to IQ as if it is a meaningful and important number. If you believe it is hardwired, then you too would want to destroy the Department of Education and stop trying to create standardised outcomes.People have cast around for ways to characterise the ideology that links the west coast of tech entrepreneurs and founders to the north-east and midwest of tycoons and conservatives around the Maga coalition. One way to see it is as a return to nature, a flight to a belief in implacable truths around intelligence, gender and race in the face of a changing world.Yet here’s the rub. That same coalition has bet the future of the US economy on breakthrough developments in artificial intelligence. To date, generative AI is primarily a means of automating away many of the very white-collar jobs that had previously been the heart of the knowledge economy. ChatGPT, its cheerleaders claim, can code better than a Stanford computer science graduate. It can make slides, take minutes and draft talking points quicker than any product of an elite liberal arts college. It can discover protein structures faster than any top hire from MIT. The argument in favour of paying attention to IQ was that, unfair or not, it was a ticket on to the escalator of upward mobility and meritocracy associated with jobs in finance, tech, advertising and even public service or higher education. If those jobs are whittled down to a nub, then on its own terms, the point of caring about IQ vanishes as well.As Musk has said himself, “we are all extremely dumb” compared with the “digital super intelligence” that he is helping to build through initiatives such as his model at xAI, whichrecently boughtthe social media platform X. The Silicon Valley venture capitalist Marc Andreessen wrote once that software was eating the world. If their predictions are true, it will eat the right’s precious IQ too.Quinn Slobodian’s latest book is Hayek’s Bastards: Race, Gold, IQ, and the Capitalism of the Far RightDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The qualification, of course, is thatthe likely 180p-a-share offer from DoorDash of the USstacks up poorly against the 390p at which Deliveroo listed in 2021.The moral of the numbers, though, is surely only that the flotation, or IPO market in early 2021 was infected by Covid-19 silliness. Almost everything was listed at over-inflated prices in a weird period when fund managers seemed to have lost the ability to say no to smooth-talking investment bank promoters.Deliveroo shares surge after £2.7bn DoorDash takeover moveRead moreDeliveroo’s“floperoo”, as the debut was dubbed, has turned out better, relatively speaking, than those of Made.com, whichentered administrationlittle more than a year after its £775m arrival, and Dr Martens, whichhas issued five profit warningsand is currently 85% below its £3.7bn listing price. Or, from late-2020, THG, the online beauty and protein shakes group, is even further adrift of its starting price.So, given that the old yardsticks are useless, the questions forDeliverootoday are, first, whether it makes sense to sell now and, if it does, whether it can whip up a competitive auction.On timing, there’s a fair argument that yes, this is the moment to do a deal. A consolidation game among food apps has gone global and Deliveroo is clearly destined for the role of prey rather than predator. It is far smaller than the likes of South African-owned Prosus (acquirer of Just Eat) or Meituan, out of China, or DoorDash.The danger in trying to stick to the independent life is that you eventually get out-muscled by rivals with deeper pockets. Deliveroo is number two in the UK and in France. Those are valuable positions but also hard to improve upon. If they are worth more to a buyer, it is rational to talk terms.As for the chances of a bidding war, it feels unlikely. In the shareholders’ dreams, Amazon, a 13% owner of Deliveroo, would emerge as saviour and blow DoorDash out of the water. The script is not impossible, but also far from straightforward when you remember that the Competition and Markets Authority spluttered over Amazon’s initial stake-building. Even in its new government-approved “pro-growth” guise, the watchdog might demand an inquiry into Amazonian overreach in home delivery.By contrast, an exit for cash via DoorDash has the virtue of simplicity. The US firm, which doesn’t currently operate in the UK, is the obvious fit in the global jostling.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The arrest, a highly publicized and dramatic move from the Trump administration, seemed designed to elicit fear among judges, government bureaucrats and ordinary Americans that any effort to slow, impede or merely not facilitate the administration’s mass kidnapping and deportation efforts will lead to swift, forceful and disproportionate punishment by Donald Trump allies. Her arrest may be the opening salvo of a broader Trump assault on judges.Even if you believe the FBI’s allegations,their accountof Dugan’s alleged misconduct is trivial and flimsy, wholly undeserving of the administration’s sadistically disproportionate response. The FBI claims that earlier this month, on 17 April, when an undocumented man was in Dugan’s Milwaukee courtroom charged with misdemeanor battery, she learned that Ice agents were waiting in a public hallway to arrest him. Later, in her courtroom, when she saw the defendant moving toward a main exit, she told the man, “Wait, come with me,” and directed him towards a side door instead. (He was captured by Ice shortly thereafter.) The FBI arrested her in her courtroom and has indicted her on two federal felony charges: obstruction and “concealing an individual”.The presence of Ice agents looking to abduct, detain and deport various undocumented people has long been a problem in local courthouses, keeping municipalities from interacting officially with their residents and slowing the pace of court business as undocumented people have become reluctant to show up at courthouse buildings, be it to face criminal charges, as the man in Dugan’s case was doing; to tend to civil matters; or to report crimes or pursue restraining orders against abusers. As a result, many local judges and administrators have criticized Ice’s operation policies, alleging that the agency’s aggressive tactics to enforce federal immigration law have obstructed their own ability to enforce local law. This is a distinct issue from the legality of Trump administration’simmigrationcrackdown tactics, which have also been challenged by a number of judges at the state and local level. The justice departmenthas reportedly encouraged federal prosecutorsto press charges against state and local officials who oppose the administration’s immigration policies.Donald Trump, beware – this is what a global liberal fightback looks like  | Timothy Garton AshRead moreAt the Milwaukee courthouse where Dugan works, Ice agents had already madetwo high-profile arrestsof undocumented persons there to conduct official business, actions that sent a chilling effect through the local community. (The defendant in question in Dugan’s court that day was there on a domestic violence charge; because Ice decided to appear there to arrest him on civil immigration charges instead, the proceedings had to be abruptly halted. The victims, who were present in the courtroom, did not get their chance to see justice served.) When she learned of the presence of Ice agents outside her courtroom door, the FBI alleges, Judge Dugan asked the Ice agents to leave, and pointed out that they did not have the correct warrants. She also allegedly called the situation “absurd”.The absurdity was only beginning. After capturing Dugan’s defendant, theTrump administrationevidently sought to make an example of Dugan, and concocted the trumped-up felony charges in order to criminalize her objection to their presence in her courthouse. After orchestrating her arrest, the FBI’s embattled chief, Kash Patel, tweeted gloatingly about Dugan’s capture; then, he quickly deleted the post, only to put it up again later. The FBI seems to have procedurally expedited the charges against her, having her indictment issued by a magistrate judge rather than a grand jury, and arresting Dugan rather than giving her the opportunity to turn herself in. They seem to have been going for maximum drama. For her part, Dugan – a well-known progressive in Milwaukee legal circles who spent much of her career working as a public-interest legal aid attorney – said nothing at her arraignment on Friday. Her attorney told the press, “Judge Dugan wholeheartedly rejects and protests her arrest,” adding: “It was not made in the interest of public safety.”Indeed it was not. Instead, Dugan’s arrest was made in the interest of shoring up the Trump administration’s depictions of itself as lawless, fearsome and impervious to constitutional checks on its own power. It was made in the interest of intimidating the administration’s critics and opponents. And it was made in the interest of silencing dissent.The Trump administration has been rapidly accumulating political prisoners. It began with immigrants who voiced opposition to Israel’s genocide in Gaza: Mahmoud Khalil and Rümeysa Öztürk, the graduate students who had their legal status revoked in retaliation for their pro-Palestinian opinions and who were kidnapped by the Ice secret police and shipped off to faraway prisons without process, are political prisoners. Dugan’s, too, is a political prosecution: what is at stake is not so much the law that that meager little comment – “Wait, come with me” – supposedly broke. Instead, it is that Dugan opposes the Trump mass deportation project, and she voiced that opposition in public. Her arrest is an expansion of the Trump regime’s determination into who can be made a political prisoner: with Dugan, that designation extends, in public fashion, to citizens, and even to judges. You should expect that it can expand to you.Dugan’s example is meant to frighten Americans into submission. But I think it might be more likely that she inspires us to subversion. Legality and morality are different things, and what Dugan allegedly did, whether or not it was technically legal, was supremely moral, and not a little bit brave: she refused to cooperate with a secret police force that was there to violate her courtroom, disappear her defendant, and interfere with her own distribution of justice. Doing the morally right thing – opposing Ice and mass deportations with our actions, in practical terms – will require courage from more and more of us, and a greater and greater willingness to face consequences for it.Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsTrump administrationOpinionUS immigrationUS politicsDonald TrumpLaw (US)MilwaukeeWisconsincommentShareReuse this content"

Called Respect at Work, thereview into the culturethat incubated Jimmy Savile was published in 2013.Since then, theHuw Edwards scandal– along with allegations about other stars includingGregg Wallace(which he has said were “not all true”) –has led to another BBC reviewinto its own culture. Given it has exactly the same name and was written by the same consultancy, it seems fair to ask: what exactly has changed?Then, as now,BBCmanagement promised to “tackle issues more quickly and to greater effect”. Both reports also made a series of recommendations, all enthusiastically praised by senior management.The headline newsdenying that its culture was toxic, while suggesting several new codes of conduct, prompted one insider to quip that it was all very “Nothing to see here! Fixed!”The fact that the BBC led its flagship lunchtime bulletin with its own review rather than theblackout chaos in Europedid not help the sense of self-congratulation.Fixing workplace cultures, especially in an industry where competition for work is high and job security low, is not easy. A younger generation perhaps more willing to blow the whistle on bad behaviour is also working in an industry under even greater financial pressure.But, as culture minister Lisa Nandy said in welcoming the report, the public “expect[s] the very highest standards” from the BBC.In the latest review, there was a special mention for the “avoidance of consequences in the treatment of what used to be called ‘talent’ – ‘on-air’ or ‘on-screen’ presenters”, the promotion of a “call it out” culture and a new “respond team” to help restore trust.It is perhaps the last that is the most important, for the BBC has lost the trust of many of those who work there. For these people, scandal-hit stars are the tip of an iceberg that contains huge discrepancies in pay and conditions, and increasing job insecurity.Insiders suggest that faith in management acting on the new promises is low. “We’ve had reviews in the past,” said one long-serving member of staff. “Sensible recommendations have been made, but they’ve not been acted upon.”The BBC is largely full of good people trying to do the best they can in a job they love. The management team also want to bring about change. The fact that this so often results in lengthy repetitive reviews would not matter if there was the sense that real change, not just in terms of new HR policies but an actual difference in attitudes and behaviour, happened.BBC still has figures who can make life unbearable for colleagues, says chairRead moreThere are signs of hope. Samir Shah, a former journalist and widely respected BBC chair,issued a warning to the powerful individuals– on and off screen – who continue to abuse that power to make life for their colleagues “unbearable”.“If you are a person who is prepared to abuse power or punch down or behave badly, there is no place for you at the BBC,” he said. The director general, Tim Davie, said the report marked “an important moment for the BBC and the wider industry”.Change takes a while. But time is running out for victims.There was talk of a line in the sand being drawn on Monday. Let’s hope such good intentions don’t get washed away.Jane Martinson is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But he is just as easily swayed by the elevator doormanMon 28 Apr 2025 07.24 EDTLast modified on Mon 28 Apr 2025 12.03 EDTShareThe most recent diplomatic effort to find a way to stop Russia’s invasion ofUkrainetook place at the most unlikely of events: the funeral of Pope Francis. The image of Presidents Zelenskyy and Trump leaning toward each other, under Carlo Maratta’s late-17th-century painting, The Baptism of Christ, rekindled hopes that the US might, at last, hear Kyiv out. Would this unexpected setting make Trump’s compassion, so frequently expressed for the loss of human life, real? And could it lead to a better strategy for ending this criminal and brutal war?The goal of Kyiv and the coalition of the willing – a group of 31 nations that back Ukraine in its fight against Russia – is to distance Trump from what has become a dangerous rapprochement between the Washington and Moscow. But this will be an uphill battle –Europeand Kyiv are trying to fight their way to Trump’s ear just when the US is backing Russia’s position.The most recent blow has been Trump’s willingness to recognise the annexation of Crimea and to explicitly veto Ukraine’s membership of Nato. The US’sseven-point planto end the war, presented to Kyiv and its allies in Paris last week, came alongside secretary of state Marco Rubio’s promise to abandon the talks and focus on other global issues if progress wasn’t made quickly. And yet, the US has made no movement toward guaranteeing implementation of a deal or providing deterrence against Russia having another go.Hope can lift the spirit, but it’s not a good strategy. Trump’s second term has torpedoed the world order, in a manner that is especially dangerous for Ukraine and the rest of Europe. Three factors make the diplomatic efforts to defend Europe and achieve a good outcome in Ukraine precarious.Trump says he thinks Zelenskyy is ready to give up Crimea despite previous commentsRead moreFirst, the disturbing alignment in worldview between the White House and the Kremlin. Both Trump and Putin believe the world is a superpowers’ playground, where the powerful do what they choose, and the smaller do what they must. Power is expressed as coercion and military might. Their geopolitical agendas can be achieved at the expense of other nations and territories, be they Ukraine or Greenland, inviolation of the UN charter.Trump has already validated Putin’s fabricated narrative that the war was provoked by the west and Ukraine is a culprit. In opposition to the free world, it has voted with Russia, North Korea and Belarus three times on various UN resolutions concerning the war.In March, the US Department of Justice pulled out of the international body investigating the Russian crime of aggression in Ukraine.Second, Trump’s erratic decision-making makes it hard for Ukraine’s European allies to work on a coordinated plan of their own. The feeling is that Trump will pursue not what is good for peace and stability, but whatever the last person he spoke to told him. One former business associaterecallshis fear of strategies being upset by the last thing Trump would hear from the doorman operating an elevator.It is positive that Zelenskyy and other large European state leaders, Keir Starmer and Emmanuel Macron, were able to speak with Trump in the Vatican. Their main message was likely “do not trust Putin when he says he is interested in peace, while he keeps waging war”. In recent weeks Ukraine’s top generalconfirmedthat a new Russian offensive near Kharkiv and Sumy had begun. Ukraine has insisted on a total, unconditional ceasefire for any serious talks to begin.Russia claims it is ‘ready’ for Ukraine talks but demands recognition of occupied territories – Europe liveRead moreAnd it seems that Vatican diplomacy had at least some temporary effect. On Saturday, Trumppublicly doubtedPutin’s intentions and threatened Russia with secondary sanctions if there is no deal. The last time he mentioned sanctioning Russiawas in January, but no action followed.But what if Trump’s envoy, Steve Witkoff, just back from his fourth visit to Moscow, produces the “doorman effect” and persuades Trump to continue his policy of appeasement?Russia is trying to lure the USwith business and geopolitical deals. The most personal project is the 150-storey Trump Tower in the centre of Moscow. The Kremlin has managed to have some of its most outrageous narratives voiced in the White House. It may be just a matter of time before Trump agrees to lift all US sanctions on Russia in order to do business together – and push Europe to follow suit.This brings us to the third and final reason to distrust Trumpian diplomacy: the American president loves to exercise power for the sake of it, not to engage in policymaking with clear strategic outcomes. By sidelining Europe and Ukraine and engaging in direct talks withRussia, Trump is showing his might. He believes Europe cannot defend itself against Russia without the US at the moment. This gives him power. And he also believes Ukraine depends on US intelligence and military aid, especially Patriot missiles for air defence. Being at the high table with Putin, signing a ceasefire, is also a show of power, regardless of whether the deal lasts and brings peace and justice.With such an unreliable leader in the White House, Europe simply cannot count on the US to have its back and help defend Ukraine. It is dangerous to hope that it can win the tug of war for Trump’s favour over Russia. While the talks continue, Europe must prepare for its standoff with Russia alone. Those talks may buy time, but they will not replace the urgent need for credible investment in defence to counter Russia.Orysia Lutsevych is deputy director of the Russia and Eurasia programme and head of the Ukraine forum at Chatham HouseExplore more on these topicsUkraineOpinionDonald TrumpVolodymyr ZelenskyyRussiaVladimir PutinEuropecommentShareReuse this content"

A more proportional, progressive politics must be ready to replace itMon 28 Apr 2025 13.30 EDTLast modified on Mon 28 Apr 2025 13.45 EDTShareThis week’s local elections in England find the two great parties of the 20th century locked in slow‑motioncollapse, as a surging populist right,resurgent liberalsand a fragmented progressive left scramble for survival. Labour may have won last year’s general election, but it ishaemorrhagingenthusiasm. The Conservatives aredebatingwhether their best chance lies in negotiating with Nigel Farage, who is feeding on their weakness. English politics isn’t shaking so much as crumbling, too busy fighting itself to notice.The polls could yet be wrong, but that looks unlikely. The narrative may be set by a crucial byelection inRuncorn and Helsby, where Reform UK is riding voter anger and is the favourite to overturn Labour’s 14,700 majority. Even a close result would be small comfort for the governing party. The gamble of Labour’s election guru,Morgan McSweeney, was to chase a thin sliver of the party’s Reform-minded voters. But this risks alienating the party’s progressive base, while failing to win over those already lost.Labour’s woes, though, will be overshadowed by those of the Conservatives. They look set to lose hundreds of councillors on Thursday – squeezed by Reform from the right and the Lib Dems from the left – with consequences for their control of the16 contestedcounty and unitary councils they currently run. The last time these seats were contested, the Conservatives were riding high in the polls – not muchconsolationnow. Panic is setting into Tory ranks, as MPs confront not just heavy defeat but existential collapse in a party paralysed by publicargumentsover its future.A new political settlement may emerge before the next general election in 2029. The Conservatives could by then find themselves negotiating a second “coupon election”, recalling the1918 pactwhere candidates from different parties fought under a shared banner simply to prevent mutual annihilation. The comparison feels apt. The polling expert Sir John Curtice warns that British politics faces its biggest challenge in acentury.The logical response would be a shift toward proportional representation – and to recognise that no single party can now easily claim majority support. Yet the opposite is happening: the move to first-past-the-post in mayoral elections, pushed through byBoris Johnson’s governmentand meekly accepted by Labour, will now magnify the distortions of an already broken system. Progressives, who might have thrived under the oldsupplementary votesystem for mayors, will instead pay a heavy price. In newly contested mayoralties like Lincolnshire and Hull and East Yorkshire, where Reform’s vote last July oftentopped20%, first-past-the-post all but clears the path to victory for Mr Farage’s party.Persuasion UK, a polling outfit, is correct in cautioning that Labour risks focusing too much on the populist right. Only 11% of Labour’s 2024 voters are open to backing Reform, but many more Labour voters would support the Greens (29%) or the Lib Dems (41%). If the party loses theWest of England mayoraltyto the Greens – or wins by a whisker – it bears out that warning. Labour gains most when voters see it as the only alternative to Mr Farage’s brand of Trumpian politics. Labour ought to back electoral reform. But it should also moderate its language on asylum and immigration, spend big on public services, dodge culture wars – and make every fight a choice between it and Reform.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But during a recentinterviewwith this newspaper, Henna Virkkunen, the European Union’s most senior official on digital policy, was in bullish mood. “We are very committed to our rules when it comes to the digital world,” said Ms Virkkunen, who is the EU vice-president responsible for tech sovereignty. “We want to make sure that our digital environment … is fair and it’s safe and it’s also democratic.”Last week, words were followed by deeds. In the first sanctions handed down since the establishment of the EU’s Digital Markets Act, the European CommissionfinedApple €500m and Meta €200m, after finding them guilty of unfair business practices that exploited their entrenched online “gatekeeper” position. Apple, for example, was judged to have unfairly restricted developers from distributing apps outside its own App Store, where it takes a cut from sales.Tough action or tokenism? It is safe to say these fines will not keep either company’s accountants up at night. Apple’srevenuelast year was €344bn. There are also indications that, in other areas, Brussels may be seeking to dial down tensions with the US tech giants as it seeks to avoid a full-on trade war with Washington.A separateinvestigationinto X under the auspices of the Digital Services Act – which deals with content moderation – last summer found it in preliminary breach of EU rules, following Mr Musk’s takeover in 2022. No fine has yet resulted. Meanwhile there are growing fears that EU regulations on artificial intelligence, intended to lessen the risk of disinformation and political manipulation, are in danger of being watered down underpressurefrom the Trump administration.The current volatility of transatlantic relations is such that a degree of cautious restraint is understandable. But US bullying of Brussels over its regulation of big tech on behalf of EU citizens must be robustly resisted. Mr Trump’s senior adviser for trade and manufacturing, Peter Navarro, hasmischaracterisedEuropean digital regulation as a non-tariff barrier and form of “lawfare” against American companies. The reality is more mundane: US market dominance means its tech giants will inevitably be the most affected by efforts to govern a space that is now part of the architecture of everyday life.That task, vital to maintaining a healthy public sphere, should be kept distinct from fraught trade negotiations with the White House. Easier said than done perhaps, given Mr Trump’s all-embracing mercantilism. But EU politicians (and British ones) must not be intimidated into an ill-judged deregulatory path with potentially damaging implications for democracy.Last week’s fines might have been small beer financially but they at least represented a necessary statement of intent. Alongside its investigation into X, the commission has inquiries ongoing into TikTok and Meta, also relating to content moderation. MEPs are nowcallingfor those too to be pushed to a conclusion.This may be the acid test. The US vice-president, JD Vance, has made it clear that the White House intends to act as the political wing of US big tech,comparingEuropean attempts to combat online disinformation and illegal content to Soviet-era censorship. Ms Verkkunen should stick to her guns, and ignore the flak flying from Washington.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

For Freeman, it comes with the introduction of ATMs to Tuvalu; for me, it’s the self-checkout tills of the Co-op around the corner. I used to chat to Brenda. I can’t do it now, and something dies inside me. Let’s determinedly start a queue at a vacant till, on and on, until someone, with a heave of impatient sighs, gives in.Alison LeonardHebden Bridge, West Yorkshire.Until I read Hilary Freeman’s article I thought I was alone in my crusade against this creeping supermarket menace. When asked: “Wouldn’t you prefer to use the self‑checkout?” I answer: “No thanks, I don’t work here.”Jobs are at risk as more self-service tills are introduced and supermarkets look to increase their profits. What will they be asking us to do next? Stack the shelves and sweep the floors? Just say no.Anthony BlaneNottinghamUnlike Hilary Freeman, I like self-checkouts and I find the notion that we older people are somehow desperate for human contact with supermarket staff very offensive. I want the minimum time in the supermarket so I can get out and interact with my real friends. If I want to talk in a shop, I’ll do it in an independent shop at a time when there are no queues.Clifford ChallengerSowerby Bridge, West YorkshireHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Your editorial (24 April) notes that as the policies of these parties move further right, some traditional Conservative voters will shift their allegiance away. Yet these voters are not going to the Labour party, as its leadership follows rightwards. A litany of government policies must seem as abhorrent to “old school” Conservatives as they do to traditional Labour values.Instead, there is steady growth in support for parties that are broadly in the soft left, socially and environmentally aware space: Liberal Democrats, Greens, the Scottish National party and Plaid Cymru. These four parties, albeit each with their own distinctive policy stance or geographic focus, now have a combined voting-preference share larger than that of Labour, the Conservatives or Reform. This can be seen in the three most recent nationwideopinion polls– More in Common: 26%; YouGov: 30%; Find Out Now: 30%.This trend, little reported on – an exception being Gaby Hinsliff (We obsess over the angry young men going Reform. But what of the anxious young women going Green?, 25 April) – of younger, more educated women’s despairing shift to the Green party can surely only broaden and deepen. For society is fragmenting as living standards fall, not least in response to climate breakdown, even while governments worldwide ignore this along withtheir electorates’ own viewson global heating.It should not only be the right-of-centre parties talking of electoral pacts to gain power and make a difference to our lives, but also parties to the left of this government. Otherwise, a future Nigel Farage-led government, incorporating the remains of the Conservative party, seems only too likely.Neil BrownOban, Argyll and ButeYour editorial assesses the threat posed by Reform to theConservativesin the local elections. Equally concerning is the threat Reform also poses to Labour in the forthcoming Runcorn byelection.Labour’s first few months in government have done little to stem the flow of disillusioned voters turning to Reform, with its seductive and simplistic solutions to complex problems. Keir Starmer knows that the self-imposed fiscal constraints belong to another economic era that has been swept away by Donald Trump’s unravelling of global market orthodoxies.If people are to see real change in public services and their economic wellbeing, the fiscal shackles must come off. With the Tory party failing to offer an effective alternative, creating real change in voters’ lives is the only solution to stop Nigel Farage emerging as the victor in future elections.Peter RiddleWirksworth, DerbyshireI am 67 and after a lifetime of voting Labour, I voted Green in the last election. I don’t know who to vote for now that Labour has ceased to be a party of the left. I believe in social justice and I get the impression that many in this country would like the same. I don’t agree with the current appetite for pitching groups of people against each other to stoke culture wars.If young men feel angry with their situation, perhaps we should be seeing what injustices they face before insulting them. And if young women are turning to theGreen party, maybe Labour needs to remind itself of the principles on which it was founded.Janice HillTaverham, NorfolkHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

It is Arsenal’s third appearance in the last four of Europe’s elite competition, after the victory against Villarreal in 2005-06 and the defeat by Manchester United in 2008-09.Luis Enrique urges PSG to ‘rewrite history’ against Arsenal in Champions LeagueRead moreArsenal were beaten byBarcelona in the 2005-06 finaland Arteta wants to harness the collective yearning for a first Champions League triumph, not to mention the connection he has built between the team and the fans. It underpinned the electric atmosphere at the Emirates Stadium for the 3-0 quarter-final first-legwin against Real Madrid, which set Arsenal up to progress5-1 on aggregate.“I tell them [the supporters], and I’m not exaggerating here: ‘Guys, bring your boots, bring your shorts, bring your T-shirts and let’s play every ball together,’” Arteta said. “We want to do something special. The place has to be something special, something that we haven’t seen. I really hope that everybody that comes to the Emirates and is watching and following us, brings that energy with them.“You feel it [the lack of aChampions Leaguetitle]. We have, fortunately, a lot of people that have worked in the club for many, many years and they’ve never been in this position [to win it]. So that tells you how unique and beautiful it is. We need to earn the right to be in that final and everything is going to start tomorrow. So yeah, we are making history. It’s a beautiful story right now but we want much more. We have to take the opportunity and make it happen.”Arteta refused to dwell on any negativity, unlike his PSG counterpart, Luis Enrique, who complained about his team’s treatment by the French media. PSG, who are in the Champions League semi-finals for a fourth time in six seasons, are also chasing a first triumph in the competition.Arteta is emboldened not only by how his team took Madrid apart butPSG’s struggles at Aston Villain the quarter-final, second-leg when theylost 3-2and only just progressed 5-4 on aggregate. Then, there was the manner of Arsenal’s 2-0 home win against PSG in the second round of ties in this season’s league phase. That night, it was Arsenal’s greater physicality, as much as anything else, that stood out.“You learn a lot from every game,” Arteta said. “Going to the Bernabéu is probably the biggest test that you can have as a European team. That brings confidence and experience to a team that most of us … we never had before.“I take a lot of things from the game we played here [against PSG]. It was very important for us because at the time, they were one of the best teams in Europe. To put yourself into that category, to that level and say: ‘Actually, we can compete and we can beat them.’ It was good preparation for what is coming right now.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Should the RFU host Chelsea at Twickenham, it would be a lucrative move for the union, which last November announced record losses and is struggling to break even.No green light: RFU threatens to leave Twickenham over Beyoncé spatRead moreAsked if the RFU’s licence would allow for Twickenham to stage Chelsea fixtures, Sweeney said: “It would allow it to happen. There have been conversations previously about possible Premiership [sic] clubs coming here. Richmond council, Richmond borough is more concerned about that. I just think in terms of impact on local residents, numbers of fans and so on they’re a little bit more sensitive. It may depend on which club it is. It would be a big financial number, I know Richmond borough would definitely have a conversation about that though.”The RFU is planning a £660m redevelopment of Twickenham, assuming a move to Milton Keynes is off the table. Sweeney said last month that it would be “a very difficult call” to stay at Twickenham if Richmond council did not grant a licence to host more concerts and mentioned Milton Keynes and Birmingham as possible destinations.The RFU is permitted to host three a year and only two on consecutive nights with a limited capacity of 55,000. The union says Twickenham, which has a capacity of 82,000, is empty for 340 days a year with Sweeney previously claiming that, due to the restrictions, the RFU missed out onstaging Beyoncé concerts. As a result the RFU is lobbying Richmond council for 15 events a year at a capacity of 75,000 and expects an answer by September.“We’re making really good progress with Richmond,” Sweeney said. “The conversations with them have been positive, it’s a cooperative process. They see the value that we bring to the area and they understand why we need to have more non-rugby events when you compare it to Tottenham, Wembley, the O2, they can see why we need those non-rugby events to make the thing viable.“We’ve always said our preference was to remain here. Not just for cultural reasons and the history. Hospitality and ticketing are 50% of our revenue and from a geographical point of view this is a really important part of the country to be in. There was a lot of investigation into what the different options are and we came out saying our preference would be to remain here.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Nine times this season in the league, Arsenal have led in games that they have failed to win. On 13 occasions, Liverpool have improved their result in the second half (that is, turned a draw into a win, or a defeat into a draw or a win). It has not been a thrilling conclusion –they’ve wrapped the title upbefore the end of April with four games to spare and have looked probable champions for at least three months – but at least they had their day of celebration of Anfield.Premier League and FA Cup semis: 10 talking points from the weekendRead moreAnd because it was Tottenham, after the early blip of Dominic Solanke’s goal, there was a grand procession, a carnival of largely pressure-free attacking football, five goals including one for Mohamed Salah, a fitting way to round off what has been an excellent season for him personally. Liverpool lost the first leg of their Carabao Cup semi-final 1-0 to Spurs, but they have scored 15 against them in their other games this season. That in itself is telling of one of Liverpool’s great strengths. They may not press quite as aggressively and extravagantly as they did under Jürgen Klopp, but they press effectively nonetheless; Tottenham, who have spent most of the season almost pathologically playing out from the back despite having very little capacity to do so successful, are almost the perfect victims for them.Historically, this triumph matters because Liverpoolmove level with Manchester Unitedon 20 English league titles; Arsenal are seven behind them in third. If your tiebreaker is how often you have been second, United remain the most successful side in English history; if it’s total trophies won, it’s Liverpool. Such arguments, though, are perhaps best left to the darker corners of fan media. (20 league titles, compared with other leading leagues, is a relatively small tally – Real Madrid have 36, Juventus 36, Bayern 33 – as useful an indicator as any of how successful English football was for a long time in resisting a super-club elite).1:34Liverpool fans ecstatic after winning Premier League in Arne Slot's first season at club – videoMore interesting, perhaps, is that while United’s titles have come under just three managers, Liverpool’s have come under 10 (although that tally does include Matt McQueen, who took over from David Ashworth three months before the 1922-23 title was won). No other side has triumphed under so many; their success has been, if not exactly consistent since they claimed their first championship in 1900-01, then at least better spread than most. The 30 years they had to wait between their last title under Kenny Dalglish in 1989-90 and the Klopp title in 2019-20 represents their longest drought. English football may have remained equitable longer than most, but there has rarely been an age when Liverpool have not been challengers.How this title comes to be viewed probably depends on what happens next. On the one hand, very few managers have ever been handed a squad in quite such a good condition as the one Klopppassed on to Arne Slot, and yet at the same time there has been a growing awareness as the season has gone on that Liverpool’s squad needs strengthening in as many as five or six positions. Those are not contradictory statements, and to an extent the need for new blood is a result of Liverpool signing only one senior player last summer, but they do explain the slightly ambivalent feeling many seem to have towards this side. Is it the last great triumph of the Klopp era, with Slot as a latter-day Matt McQueen? Or is he more of a Bob Paisley, building on the great legacy of his predecessor?Either way, it has been a hugely impressive achievement. Nobody can claim the title race has been particularly exciting, but that is not to denigrate Liverpool. They have been very good and none of their rivals have been, and the result has been a largely uneventful march to the title. There was perhaps a slight wobble in recent weeks as fatigue began to bite and focus slip, but nobody else looked remotely equipped to take advantage.Had the title been sealed by Arsenal losing to Crystal Palace on Wednesday that would have been a damp squib but, in the end, it was won gloriously, on a sunny afternoon ofred smoke and raucousness, with a rampant display against a compliant Spurs.It was neither tense nor dramatic, but Liverpool have been by far the best side in thePremier Leaguethis season and that’s all that really matters.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It was originally built as part of a complex to house a 1924 trade fair. Early photographs show it to have been surrounded by fields, emphasising just how far it was from central London (it may only be 20 minutes now on the underground, but on a matchday, rammed in with tens of thousands of others, those can feel like very long minutes). Even the endlessly romanticised Twin Towers, built to recall the designs of Edwin Lutyens in New Delhi, actually housed a generator and a storeroom for flags.Wembley needed events, and the FA needed a venue for the Cup final; a deal was soon reached, and on 28 April 1923 Bolton beat West Ham 2-0 in the firstFA Cupfinal at Wembley. The game is most famous, though, for the scenes of PC George Scorey and his horse Billy clearing crowds well in excess of the 127,000 capacity off the pitch. So was born the legend of the White Horse Final, although actually Billy was mid-grey, appearing white in the famous photograph because it was such a murky day it had to be overexposed.This is an extract from Soccer with Jonathan Wilson, a weekly look from the Guardian US at the game in Europe and beyond.Subscribe for free here.Have a question for Jonathan?

During the final change of ends of her fourth-round match against the Ukrainian qualifier Yulia Starodubtseva, as she served for a comfortable victory, she learned of the power outage that had ravaged Spain, Portugal and many nearby countries, ultimately forcing play to be postponed in Madrid.As matches across the tournament grounds had already come to a halt, the two players were told that they could play out the subsequent game, but there was a catch: the live electronic line‑calling system was no longer functioning and there were no line umpires to call upon. They would have to play as if they were juniors again, calling their own lines with only the umpire there to intervene. Naturally, Andreeva began to feel the pressure.Alex de Minaur sounds warning with ruthless victory at Madrid OpenRead more“It was 15-40 on my serve and I was like: ‘Oh, Mirra. Just please, please do everything in your power to just take this game and finish this match,’” she said, laughing. “I knew that if it would go to 5-5, probably we would have to wait. Probably I would not be here yet and I would just be waiting and we would just see what we would do.”From double break point down, Andreeva pulled herself together and closed out the match. A few metres away on the neighbouring stadium court, her next opponent was also one of the fortunate players:Coco Gauffhad been in the middle of her post‑match interview after a dominant win when the power shut down. Gauff noted she had actually requested to be scheduled as the second match on‑court; for once, she was thankful to the WTA supervisers for not honouring that request.“So far, the toughest thing has been not been able to shower after my match. There’s no running water so I just had to take baby wipes and wipe myself, spray some perfume and call it a day,” Gauff said an hour after her match. “I don’t even think we’ll be able to go back to the hotel as the traffic lights are out. So it’s just crazy how much we depend on electricity. It’s really insane. It puts that in perspective and also makes me think about the humans that lived before electricity and how impressive that is.”1:24Major power outage causes chaos in Spain and Portugal – video reportOther players were not quite as fortunate. Grigor Dimitrov, the 15th seed, held a match point against Britain’s Jacob Fearnley at 6-4, 5-2 before serving for the match a game later. By 5-4, the second set back on serve, both players were walking off the court. An hour later, Dimitrov could be found sitting down alone in the sun in a quiet outdoor spot players use to warm up, smiling to himself at such an surreal turn of events.“At this point this is only a situation that you can just laugh at if I was on-court because it’s probably not going to happen ever again,” Gauff said. “You can always remember the day the power went out at the Madrid Open.”As much of Madrid came to a standstill, that chaos was reflected inside the Caja Mágica. Unlike many other tournament sites, the Madrid Open grounds are mostly indoors, below ground level and there is minimal natural light off the court. It meant that much of the grounds were plunged in total darkness. In the communal fan areas, spectators stood shoulder to shoulder, packed like sardines, relying solely on the lights from their phones.View image in fullscreenBulgaria’s Grigor Dimitrov had his match with Britain’s Jacob Fearnley interrupted.Photograph: Thomas Coex/AFP/Getty ImagesThe players themselves had things slightly better. Shortly after the outage, workers swept in with candles, with the players’ restaurant and lounge eventually illuminated by dozens of candles. Every hour, the player warm-up area seemed to take on a completely different function. Shortly after the power cut, a number of players due on-court had been warming up in total darkness. An hour later, the room was filled with players simply lying on the floor, on the phone and talking with others. Eventually, as they admitted defeat, numerous massage tables appeared and the players ended their days with physiotherapy.“I was in the gym and it’s super dark, everyone is using the phones with flashlights, but it’s also kind of fun because everyone is talking to each other and the atmosphere is a little more friendly,” Andreeva said.It soon became clear that there would be no more play on this unforgettable day. As players scrambled to secure a lift home, the line at the transport desk extended almost as long as the Wimbledon queue. Their requests were recorded with pen and paper. With traffic lights ceasing to function in the city, a three-hour journey awaited for those who secured a car. Many opted for the one‑ to two‑hour walk. Once they reached home, this time they would not be able to distract themselves by playing video games, watching TV series or doomscrolling on social media. Not everyone seemed to mind.“If you take my phone away, I’m completely fine spending time without it,” said Andreeva, who turns 18 on Tuesday. “The only thing I need in my phone right now is a flashlight.”Explore more on these topicsTennisCoco GauffnewsShareReuse this content"

If, and it remains quite a big if, he really is considering sacking Farke, the club’s chairman – who, perhaps significantly pulled out of a planned pre-match television interview at the last minute – must surely be having second thoughts after this.Leeds chairman flying to UK for talks with Daniel Farke over manager’s futureRead moreWin at Plymouth on Saturday and Farke’s formidably impressive Leeds will finish the season on 100 points and, due to their superior goal difference, clinch the Championship title. All kaleidoscopic passing and movement, they simply steamrolleredBristol Cityinto submission and the visiting manager, Liam Manning, can only hope that a defeat that could have been considerably heavier does not exert too much psychological damage at a vital moment.Although City are well placed to finish in the top six, they may still need to beat Preston at Ashton Gate on Saturday to secure a playoff semi-final against Sheffield United or, more probably, Sunderland. Manning’s players did not have a shot of any description until the 75th minute here.Given Farke’s achievement insecuring a top-two placelast week despite losing three of his best players in a £140m fire sale last summer, reports that he could be about to be sacked seem absurd. Although the manager is due to meet with Marathe this week to “discuss the future”, club sources claim it is all part of a routine end of season review and nothing out of the ordinary.Whatever the precise truth – given that the stories have not emerged from thin air it seems someone, somewhere clearly has an agenda –the club’s owners, the San Francisco-based 49ers Enterprises, are surely misguided if they really believe they can get a better manager? Do they not appreciate just how good Farke is?Interestingly, Angus Kinnear, the outgoing Everton-bound Leeds chief executive penned an ode to the German in Monday’s match programme. “I want to congratulate Daniel on an almost immaculate season,” he wrote. “This club needs a leader with broad shoulders, strong principles and unshakeable belief if it is to be successful. I don’t believe we could have a better leader.”Farke himself remained characteristically poised before kick-off, telling a television interviewer: “It’s not my topic … I just recommend you don’t believe everything you read in a newspaper.”View image in fullscreenLargie Ramazani fires home Leeds’ fourth goal in stoppage time.Photograph: Robbie Jay Barratt/AMA/Getty ImagesAfterwards, still soaked in the champagne his players had sprayed over him at the final whistle, he proved similarly diplomatic. “Right now it’s just about celebrating this special day,” said Farke. “I’m not worried about myself, I’m very proud of what we’ve achieved. I signed a long term contract here and the next step is to establish this side in the Premier League.”Earlier, dressed in his trademark black parka, Farke took his place in the home dugout on an unusually warm late April evening, the ground turned into a sea of twirling yellow scarves as the stadium rocked to a raucously rousing rendition of the club anthem “Marching on Together”.Five years ago when Leeds were last promoted to the Premier League, the Covid pandemic dictated that locals were denied their party. They certainly made up for it here and a City team penned into their own half and struggling to string two passes together proved perfectly obliging guests.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

City mark zonally but that system failed here.O’Leary initially kept them in the game, with the best of several fine saves denying Solomon. Leeds though monopolised possession and doubled their lead when Wilfried Gnonto ran onto Piroe’s superb through ball and expertly lifted his shot over the advancing O’Leary.By way of emphasising that 30 points separate these sides, substitute Largie Ramazani scored the third with his first touch after meeting a ball from Junior Firpo as perfectly calibrated as Leeds performance.When Ramazani controlled Ilia Gruev’s through pass and whipped a stoppage-time fourth past O’Leary Elland Road offered Farke a standing ovation.

Brecel won the sprint to the dressing room as he summoned a break of 71 to see off the 2016 finalist 13-4, and he was swiftly followed by O’Sullivan, who rifled in a break of 95 to complete his victory over Pang by the same score.Having barely been challenged to get out of second gear by his outclassed opponent, O’Sullivan, who came to Sheffield having not played acompetitive match since January, remained predictably downbeat about his performance.Rating his form as “probably two out of 10”, O’Sullivan, who will face another Chinese opponent, Si Jiahui, in the last eight, said: “I wasn’t bothered about getting it over quickly – I need all the table time I can get. I think I’ve dragged them (my opponents) down to a poorer level. I think they expected me to play better and were maybe shocked that I didn’t, but I don’t think Si will fall into that trap, and that’s what makes him dangerous.”Si, a shock semi-finalist on hisCrucible debut two years ago, survived a late scare to see off Ben Woollaston 13-10 and confirm his place in the quarters.Asked about his chances of winning a record eighth Crucible crown, O’Sullivan said: “I’d have to play a lot better. I’d have to start potting a few long ones, pinning them to the back rail a bit more. It needs a bit more improving in those areas really.”Brecel’s own victory was shaped by a stunning first session on Saturday, for which he had jetted in on a private jet from Belgium with four hours to spare, and proceeded to compile two centuries and three more breaks over 50 as he racked up a virtually unassailable 7-1 lead.View image in fullscreenLuca Brecel needed only one frame in the evening session to reach the last eight.Photograph: Danny Lawson/PA“I don’t like to hang around too long,” said Brecel, who had hired the jet with the help of his friend, the Arsenal and Belgium winger Leonardo Trossard, but neglected to reveal its cost. “I always try to get here as late as possible. Even today I came in 15 minutes before the game. That has always been my way, and as long as it works, that’s good.”Brecel, who will face Judd Trump in the last eight, arrived at the Championships in negligible form but believes he stands a chance of repeating hisstunning run to the title in 2023.“I’m not sure if I’m playing as good as then but I’m definitely not so worried about winning the title,” he said. “Two years ago it felt like a golden chance, and now I feel like I can get back there and do it again, so it’s not that much pressure.”Earlier, Trump held off a spirited fightback from Shaun Murphy, who recovered from 12-6 down to reel off four consecutive breaks over 70 and reduce the deficit to 12-10, to reach the quarter-finals. Murphy had a chance to close further but a missed red to the corner let in Trump for a break of 58 which effectively secured a hard-fought 13-10 win.“Shaun was in a world of his own for them four or five frames,” Trump told the BBC. “I was a little bit worried but I just had to back myself in that last frame to put a nice stroke on that first red and get in. By the time it’s got to 12-10, you’re probably starting to think the worst. The way he was potting the balls as well … Shaun when he gets the support around him absolutely loves it.”Explore more on these topicsWorld Snooker ChampionshipRonnie O'SullivanJudd TrumpSnookernewsShareReuse this content"

There were shouts of joy as the weight of what they had just achieved dawned on the players, havingreached a Champions League finalfor the first time since the club won it in 2007.The team’s leader, the normally stoic Kim Little had tears in her eyes. She was soon joined by Lia Wälti who came over to her midfield colleague and wrapped her in a long embrace, a quiet moment of triumph in the mayhem.Slegers ‘so proud’ as Arsenal book WCL final place after stunning comebackRead moreIt seemed the perfect way to celebrate the Arsenal captain, a player who has served the club for 15 seasons (in two stints) and has built her career on her understated brilliance. Little is not a vocal leader; instead, she commands the respect of those around her by letting her football do the talking.At 34 years old and edging slightly towards the end of her career, there is still no doubt Little remains one of the talents of her generation, one who perhaps deserves to be celebrated more frequently.She is the heartbeat of Renée Slegers’s side, a steady presence in the centre of the pitch who has adapted her game over the years to suit the needs of her team. Other players attract more headlines, but the former Scotland international holds the pieces of the puzzle together, quietly dictating the tempo.Against Lyon, she produced a performance for the ages, controlling the middle of the park alongside the effervescent Mariona Caldentey as they nullified the threat from the eight-times European champions. It was a display that earned her player of the match and one that reminded everyone she still has so much to give.“The first and only person I wanted to see was Kim,” said a visibly emotional Leah Williamson. “Kim Little is an unbelievable footballer who goes under the radar all the time.View image in fullscreenArsenal’s Kim Little in action with Lyon’s Lindsey Heaps.Photograph: Manon Cruz/Reuters“Unfortunately, the international stage didn’t provide her with any of these incredible opportunities but she’s a player worthy of seven or eight Champions League titles. I’m very proud the team did that for her today.”Her manager was equally eager to celebrate a player who, when fit, is one of the first names on the teamsheet. You can only imagine how much of a help Little’s presence has been to Slegers since she put in temporary charge last October and thenofficially appointed managerin January.“It was such a special moment for Kim,” the Arsenal manager said. “She has been a part of the club for so long. If you see how she invests and how much she works … all the players see it and feel it.

The holders are chasing theirthird successive Champions League titleand in their8-2 demolition of Chelseaarguably looked even better than ever. The burgeoning partnership between Little and Caldentey will be key if Arsenal are to be successful.Quick GuideWCL success boosts status of English clubsShowThe runners-up in the Women's Super League next season will get a direct qualification spot in the main \"League phase\" of the 2026-27 Women's Champions League, in addition to the WSL champions, owing to English clubs' strong performances in the WCL.Arsenal's run to the final this season, combined with Chelsea reaching the semi-finals for a third consecutive campaign and Manchester City's run to this season's quarter-final, have all helped to boost the English league's coefficient in Uefa's points-based system, which assesses performances over the past five seasons. The WSL previously has only had one automatic spot in the main stage of the competition, for the domestic champions.England's rise up to second place in the coefficient ranking, from fourth, will also mean that the WSL's third-placed side can enter the final round of qualifying, rather than entering in the earlier rounds, which will still be the case in August 2025 when the third-placed WSL side from this side – currently set to be Manchester United – will need to progress through multiple rounds of qualifying to reach the main league phase. From 2026, just one two-legged tie would stand in their way. No English club has won European women's football's top prize since Arsenal in 2007.Tom GarryWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Caldentey has been a revelation for them since signing from the Spanish champions in the summer, adopting a deeper role while continuing to influence in front of goal. They will need to be at their very best when faced with the threats of Aitana Bonmatí, Patri Guijarro and Alexia Putellas in order to control the central areas and attempt to stop Barcelona playing through the lines.Little will guide her team on the biggest stage in European football with the same unassuming level-headedness she has displayed for years. In Lisbon, she will equal the club record for Champions League appearances held by Emma Byrne. She will not want the fuss but it is an accolade worth noting whatever the outcome. Predictably, however, it will be her teammates who will lead the charge in that respect rather than Little herself.Explore more on these topicsArsenal WomenWomen's Champions LeagueWomen's footballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Ministers need to change these ridiculous rules if they want to stand any chance of meeting their own targets for woodland creation.”The England woodland creation offer (EWCO) is a government scheme run by the Forestry Commission that offers grants to landowners and farmers in England as an incentive to plant and grow more trees. The scheme has supported only 501 hectares (1,238 acres) of natural regeneration since it began in May 2021, compared with 8,642 hectares of new woods created by tree planting.Ecologists have argued that naturally regenerated woods are better for wildlife than planted woods because they contain a more diverse range of tree species and ages, and are better adapted to soil conditions and local climate.The government introduced an option for “natural colonisation” – a term used interchangeably with natural regeneration – in the EWCO grant scheme in 2021, which provided funding for landowners and farmers to fence off areas to protect trees from grazing with livestock and allow them to self-seed.EWCO rules restrict funding by requiring natural regeneration to land within 75 metres of an existing tree; however, studies show that woodland birds carry acorns between 1km and 6km (0.6 to 3.7 miles) from their mother oaks. Campaigners have suggested that this conflict may be a key reason for the low commission of natural regeneration grants compared with funds given out for tree planting.“Trees are perfectly capable of self-seeding: after all, they’ve been doing so for millions of years,” said Shrubsole. “Whilst tree planting certainly has its place, we could have far richer, more natural forests if only we properly supported farmers and landowners to let trees naturally regenerate.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Whilst we recognise the benefits natural colonisation can bring, land managers are best placed to decide what woodland creation measures are most appropriate for their site.”Explore more on these topicsTrees and forestsRewildingEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

Temperatures of 25-28C are likely across parts of Germany, France and southern Britain, especially later in the week, with high pressure bringing dry and sunny conditions.Far higher temperatures are expected acrossPakistanand parts of north-west India. An ongoing heatwave will nudge temperatures to 7C above normal until the end of the month across several regions including Punjab, Islamabad and Kashmir. A peak of 48-49C is likely across parts of the Sindh region, and the authorities have issued public warnings urging people to take precautionary measures against the extreme heat.A change in weather is predicted in Pakistan at the beginning of May, bringing some relief to those suffering from the heatwave. Moist air from the Arabian Sea is likely to raise humidity levels, triggering thunderstorms and heavy rainfall, with lightning, hail, dust storms and strong winds likely to create hazardous conditions.Meanwhile, severe storms could affect parts of the US early this week, particularly the upper midwest. Strong winds, tornadoes and large hail have been reported in recent days in areas including Texas and Colorado. The threat of severe weather will continue over the coming days and spread north-eastwards.As warm, moisture-laden air surges north across the Great Plains and into the midwest, it will interact with colder air to produce unstable atmospheric conditions. This is likely to trigger severe thunderstorms and an increasing chance of tornadoes.Damaging winds, heavy rain and large hail are also likely, with flash flooding possible in the stormiest areas. The storm risk will spread into the north-east before easing midweek.Explore more on these topicsEnvironmentWeather trackerWashington DCPakistanEuropeSouth and central AsiaExtreme heatanalysisShareReuse this content"

There will be a refreshed code of conduct, specific guidance for on-air presenters and updated employment and freelance contracts “to set out clear expectations around behaviour”.It follows high-profile cases of alleged bullying and inappropriate behaviour. At the time the report was commissioned, the BBC was also hit with allegations from the actor Amanda Abbington of bullying on Strictly Come Dancing. In November, the presenterGregg Wallaceannounced he wouldstep away from his role on MasterChefafter the BBC received complaints about alleged misconduct.The review found there were some staff who believed there were a minority of people at the BBC – on and off-air – who were in effect allowed to behave unacceptably.“Even though they are small in number, their behaviour creates large ripples which negatively impact the BBC’s culture and external reputation,” the report concluded.It is the latest attempt by the BBC to reform internal culture after a watershed report in 2013 that followed the Jimmy Savile scandal. Ever since, BBC bosses have talked of having a “zero-tolerance” approach to bad behaviour. Insiders have said internal processes had already improved significantly over the last decade.As a result of the review, carried out by the consultancy Change Associates, the BBC will alter how concerns and cases are managed, try to identify issues sooner and conduct and add wide-ranging training development and support for staff.Tim Davie, the BBC’s director general, said: “The action we are taking today is designed to change the experience of what it is to be at the BBC for everyone and to ensure the values we all sign up to when we arrive here – the values that, for most of us, are what made us want to come to the BBC in the first place – are lived and championed by the whole organisation each and every day.”BBC bosses will be hoping the findings will allow it to move on from some recent high-profile cases. Wallace was the subject of several allegations, including from the presenter Kirsty Wark, who was a CelebrityMasterChefcontestant in 2011 and alleged thatWallace told “sexualised” jokes during filming.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It was accused of missing opportunities to act sooner. The inquiry had been triggered by a 2022 Guardian and BBC News joint investigation into the DJ’s behaviour.Westwood denied all the allegations, with a spokesperson saying they were “completely false”.Last summer, theMatch of the Dayand the One Show presenter Jermaine Jenas was sacked by the BBC over allegations he sent unsolicited messages to a female colleague.Philippa Childs, the head of the Bectu union, welcomed the BBC’s acceptance of the review’s recommendations. “Repeated and historical scandals involving senior talent at the BBC exposed an organisation in need of a full rethink of its culture,” she said.“We hope this report serves as that moment. The commitment to draw a line in the sand must not be an empty promise. BBC staff and freelancers, and the wider public, need demonstrable evidence that the BBC is fully committed to improving how it handles reports of inappropriate behaviour, and we will be holding the BBC to account to ensure if follows through on implementing the report’s recommendations.”Explore more on these topicsBBCSamir ShahBullyingnewsShareReuse this content"

On Sunday, however, the union announced that nominations would reopen until 26 May, and specified that non-members such as Butler would be eligible to be nominated. Wrack will serve as acting general secretary in the interim.Betsan Criddle KC, representing Butler and Lockyer, told Mr Justice Goose sitting in the high court: “The union has given the applicants what they were seeking by way of relief and a consent order has now been agreed. The application is withdrawn, and there is an agreement in respect of costs.”An embarrassing high court showdown was averted after NASUWT branches were informed over the weekend that the union’s national executive had received further legal advice over flaws that had excluded other candidates from the race.Robert Lewis, a partner at Mishcon de Reya, which represented the two claimants, said: “Today’s agreement to reopen the nomination process underscores the importance of trade unions following their own rulebooks in conducting free and fair elections.”He wcontinued: “From a legal standpoint, this case is unique. We are not aware of any previous precedent for a union being forced to withdraw the appointment of a general secretary on legal grounds.“The case demonstrates that members and prospective candidates can, and should, hold unions to account if they believe key democratic principles have been overlooked.”Many grassroots members expressed concern about the appointment of Wrack, a non-teacher, which came shortly after he had been defeated in his attempt to be re-elected as the FBU’s general secretary, a post he had held for 20 years.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It is a shame that this matter was not resolved before legal proceedings were issued.“So much time, and valuable union funds, have been wasted because of a failure to follow what was clearly stated in the union’s rules. This is a significant moment for our union, and I look forward to fully participating in a transparent process that ensures every member’s voice is heard.”In a statement on Sunday, the NASUWT said: “The national executive recognise that the local associations and individuals who have raised concerns about the process have done so in good faith and the union now have responded to those concerns by extending the period for nomination as outlined above.”Explore more on these topicsTeachingTrade unionsnewsShareReuse this content"

It also made the presenter the target of some extraordinary online hate from those who accused him of persecuting motorists.After years ofdocumenting clashes and close shaves on the road, Vine has announced he is ending his sharing of footage, saying the fallout they generated had become too hard to bear. “I’m stopping my cycling videos,” he announced. “The trolling just got too bad. They have had well over 100m views but in the end the anger they generate has genuinely upset me.”He said a “regular theme” had been an apparent desire by some online attackers to see him “crushed under a truck”, something he described as a “very real danger” to commuting cyclists.‘It’s not a political thing’: Jeremy Vine on cycle safety – and that helmet camRead moreVine accompanied his announcement with posts he had received from angry critics. One stated he was “beyond hated” and asked him to upload another video “if it’s you getting run down and hospitalised”. Another said they hoped the next motorist he confronted “kicks your traitor head in”. A third said: “It may be terrible but I hope he falls under the wheels of five cars that reverse and make sure the job’s done.”The BBC Radio 2 andChannel 5host said his aim had been to make drivers think about the dangers of trying to navigate a busy city on a bike. He admitted he could get a “little cross when a driver has, say, pulled out without looking”, but said he had only ever uploaded the videos to highlight the dangers involved.View image in fullscreenJeremy Vine’s cycling videos have had more than 100m views on social media.Photograph: Jeremy VineVine said his decision to stop the recordings followed the theft of his bike last week – an incident also captured on camera and posted online. “Do I want to get a replacement and go back into the trolling-furnace? As I say, it just got too hot,” he said. “A new cycle video would make my phone physically heat up in my pocket. There are at least two death threats against me currently being investigated by police.“I enjoy debates but not abuse. It’s strange that getting interested in road safety can actually endanger a person. I see other cyclists facing the same and wonder how they deal with it. So when I get my new bike I’ll stay vigilant but won’t share my adventures.”Vine’s latest and perhaps last video appears to show a taxi dropping off a passenger directly into a cycle lane – a move that prompted Vine to ring his bell in warning, only for the driver to honk his horn back at him. Some of his latest videos featured AI-generated imagery and songs, including one that riffed on a driver telling him he was “drifting to the middle” of a lane.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, she was found guilty of the offences by a jury at Swansea crown court.The girl, who cannot be named, will be eligible for release on licence after serving half of the sentence but the judge, Paul Thomas KC, told her she could be recalled to custody if she behaved badly again once freed.The jury heard how on 24 April last year, the girl told Elias: “I’m going to kill you. I’m going to fucking kill you,” and started to stab her. At one point, the girl dropped the blade but she picked it up and attacked Hopkin.The girl moved away and allegedly called out to a female pupil: “I’m going to fucking kill you.” She ran towards her, pointing the blade at her, and stabbed her.Hopkin sustained leg, chest, shoulder and neck injuries. Elias was wounded in the arm and hand. The pupil who was attacked sustained an arm injury.After the stabbing,the teenager told police officers:“That’s one way to be a celebrity,” adding: “I’m pretty sure this is going to be on the news, so more eyes are going to be looking at me.”The judge told the girl: “You tried to kill three people, two teachers and another pupil. You came to school that day planning to do that as far as Mrs Elias was concerned. You hated her.Referring to the remark in which she said the attack would make her famous, he said: “I believe what you did that day you did above all for attention, attention which perhaps you haven’t had from others in your life in the past in the way that you would have wanted. I think in a weird way you enjoyed the reaction and publicity.”He added: “I don’t think you are genuinely sorry. I don’t think you really care much if at all about [what the three victims] suffered.”Thomas said the girl had made a “serious threat” to someone while being held in custody after the attacks and accepted she would pose a “potential risk” when she was finally released. He said: “A lot depends on how you change and mature and that can’t be predicted at the moment.”The blade the girl used in the attempted murders was her father’s, and used for fishing.In her victim impact statement, Elias said: “I will never forget the moment I saw the tip of the blade. That image is etched into my mind; it returns often, especially when I’m alone. It’s a moment that replays itself over and over.”Addressing her attacker, she said: “Your motive was clear: you intended to murder me. You didn’t manage to finish what you started … You have put me and my family and the entire school through hell.”Elias told the teenager she hoped she could find a way forward and “make something good out of this dark chapter”. She said: “If you make the right choices there are opportunities for you – please take them.”Hopkin also addressed the girl directly, telling her: “You have been with me every single day since 24 April last year. You have filled my thoughts every day since.” She added: “I worry about your future. I don’t want you punished for ever. I hope you find a way forward.”Hopkin said the attack had been “the worst experience of my life” but added she was glad she had been there to protect Elias and stopped the girl becoming a murderer. She said: “I will always be proud of what I did.” Hopkin said the thought of returning to teaching filled her with dread.Caroline Rees KC, defending, said the girl had difficulty expressing emotions but had expressed remorse. She said she was a “very complicated” child who had suffered “significant adversity” and had “slipped through the net”. But Rees said: “She is so young there is a possibility for change.”Explore more on these topicsWalesKnife crimeCrimenewsShareReuse this content"

Kill your local MP.”Katie Amess, whose father, David Amess, wasmurdered by an Islamic State fanaticin his Southend West constituency in 2021, said she was “gobsmacked at the stupidity of somebody or a group of people being in the public eye and saying such dangerous, violent rhetoric”.She said the band’s alleged comments were deeply upsetting for her and her family.“It is just beyond belief that human beings would speak like that in this day and age and it is extremely dangerous,” Amess toldBBC News NI’s Good Morning Ulster programme.Amess said there were “absolute nutters” who could be incentivised by the alleged comments, and the band should apologise to her and “every other person that has been offended by this”.View image in fullscreenKatie Amess, right (with her mother, Julia Amess), said she was prepared to meet the band and have a conversation with them.Photograph: PA Images/AlamyDowning Street described Kneecap’s alleged comments as “completely unacceptable”. Keir Starmer’s official spokesperson said on Monday: “We do not think individuals expressing those views should be receiving government funding.”The Metropolitan police force said its counter-terrorism internet referral unit was also assessing a second video from another gig that seemed to show a Kneecap member shouting “up Hamas, up Hezbollah” at a performance at the O2 Forum Kentish Town in November 2024, and a Hezbollah flag being displayed.Both Hamas and Hezbollah are banned in the UK and it is a crime to express support for them.Kemi Badenoch, the Conservative party leader, has since called for police to prosecute the group. “Kneecap’s glorification of terrorism and anti-British hatred has no place in our society,” she posted on X. “After the murder of Sir David Amess, this demands prosecution.”Badenoch blocked a government grant to the group while she was business secretary. Last year Kneecapwon a discrimination challengeover the decision to refuse them a £14,250 funding award, after the UK government conceded it was “unlawful”.Amess said she was prepared to meet the band and have a conversation with them. “I’m sure deep down they are nice people. Hopefully they just made a mistake and are going to apologise for it.”On Monday, Ireland’s taoiseach, Micheál Martin, was asked to comment on calls from some of the band’s critics for its members to be denied a new US visa. He said it would “benefit the entire conversation if Kneecap were to clarify really urgently their position in respect of Hezbollah [and] Hamas, and also their very clear denunciation of any violence or threat of violence against public representatives”.Earlier this month, the former X Factor judge Sharon Osbourne called for Kneecap’s US work visasto be revokedafter they displayed messages about the war in Gaza during their set at Coachella festival.After Coachella, Kneecap – Liam Óg Ó Hannaidh, Naoise Ó Cairealláin and JJ Ó Dochartaigh –hit backat criticisms, saying: “Statements aren’t aggressive. Murdering 20,000 children is though.”Their manager, Daniel Lambert, said the band had received death threats after Coachella, which were “too severe to get into”.Explore more on these topicsKneecapBelfastNorthern IrelandUK security and counter-terrorismCounter-terrorism policyKemi BadenochHouse of CommonsnewsShareReuse this content"

M&S did not confirm the number of items affected but said it had worked with Ocado and its suppliers “to minimise any disruption to the small proportion of the range delivered through our network to Ocado”.The disruption caused by the hack – and uncertainty over when it will end – has wiped more than £500m off the stock market value of M&S in the past week as experts said it had clearly suffered a cyber-attack on a huge scale.Vodafone whistleblowers warned executives about plight of high street store staffRead moreThe company has apologised to shoppers for the “inconvenience” caused by the attack, which will hit its online clothing and homeware sales amounting to almost £3.8m a day on average.On Monday, the retailer told 200 agency staff at its main distribution centre for its clothing and homewares at Castle Donington in Leicestershire to stay at home as orders on M&S.com remained on hold for the fourth day in a row, as first reported bySky News.Shoppers are still able to browse online and shop in M&S’s physical stores using cash or cards, but some difficulties continue in stores with gift cards not currently being accepted. Returning goods is only possible at tills in clothing and homeware stores or via post. Food stores are not currently able to accept returns.However, the company said shoppers did not need to take any action – suggesting no customer data had been accessed.M&S has hired cybersecurity experts to help investigate and manage the problem and said it was taking actions to further protect the network to ensure it could continue serving shoppers.It has limited access to its systems via its virtual private network for staff working from home to try to stop the spread of the attack, the Sunday Times reported.Clothing suppliers told the Guardian they had not been asked to pause deliveries as yet but feared this could be the case if online orders were paused for another week or more.“If it is not resolved by the end of this week it is going to become an issue,” one said.He said the difficulties came at a time that “sales are going exceptionally well in stores and things are looking fantastic”. May was likely to be a “huge month” for some clothing products given the burst of warm weather, which has kickstarted demand for summer gear and before the wedding and school proms season.The retail website closure came after several days of problems in stores where contactless payments and the collection of online orders were hit from Monday.Contactless paymentswere restarted late on Thursday.A separate technical problem on the Saturday of the busy Easter weekend affected only contactless payments.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Those expecting to pick up online orders in stores this week that had been placed before Wednesday were told to wait for a “ready to collect” notification email before heading to a store. It admitted to additional difficulties for those who had ordered party food, including wedding cakes, with some orders cancelled while notification emails were not always working even if orders were arriving in stores.Security experts warned shoppers to watch out for scammers capitalising on the high-profile incident.Kate Calvert, an analyst at Investec, said the longer it took for online sales to resume, the worse the hit would be for M&S. “There will be a short-term profit impact without a doubt,” she said.M&S said in January that ithad rung up strong sales over the Christmas period. It is due to publish full-year results on 21 May.Explore more on these topicsMarks & SpencerOcadoRetail industryCybercrimenewsShareReuse this content"

The Royal College of Nursing (RCN) has also warned it will not accept pay awards taking resources from the frontline.However, the Guardian understands that the Treasury has said it will categorically not fund the pay rises by borrowing, meaning that additional pay increases must come from cuts to other budgets.Government sources indicated there was a precedent for the government to accept the recommendations from the pay review bodies – but no final decision has been made.One source said: “Unlike like previous governments, we are not going to go and get more money from markets to pay for these things.”In the Department of Health and Social Care in particular, there is resignation that the pay rise should be funded and feeling among senior ministers that allowing any further strikes would be hugely damaging politically, to recruitment effortsand bringing down waiting lists. “Wes [Streeting, the health secretary,] got a generous settlement in the autumn,” one departmental source said.Two pay review bodies, one for teachers and one for NHS staff, are understood to have recommended higher pay awards than the 2.8% budgeted for by the government. The Times reported it would be about 4% for teachers and about 3% for NHS staff.Keir Starmer said he hoped the government could work with NHS staff to find an agreeable solution to avoid strike action. Asked about the possibility of strikes, he said: “I don’t want to see strike action, I don’t think anybody wants to see strike action.“And certainly here we are in a healthcare environment with all the staff working really hard. The last thing they want to do is to go into dispute again. We solved disputes, we are working with the NHS. It’s because of the way that we are working with the NHS that we are able to bring waiting lists down and make other announcements today.”“What I think we are proving here – what I hope we are proving – is if you work with the NHS staff, you get better results than the last government, which just went into battle with them. So, we have got our doctors and nurses on the frontline, not the picket line, and I think everybody appreciates that’s a much better way of doing business.”Graph showing real terms pay cuts for nurses, teachers and all public sector workers.The government’s initial budget in December was strongly criticised by unions. The British Medical Association had said that it was “pay erosion” for medical staff and Unison called it “barely above the cost of living”.As one of her first acts as chancellor, RachelReeves accepted the pay review body’s recommendation for a 5.5% increaseacross all public sector professions, stressing at the time that there was “cost to not settling – a cost of further industrial action, a cost in terms of the challenge that we face in recruiting retaining doctors and nurses and teachers as well”.Stephen Kinnock, the care minister, confirmed on Monday the government had received the recommendations. “We’re all about putting more money into the pockets of working people, but we do also have to ensure that we are balancing the books, and we’ve got to work in terms of public sector pay within fiscal constraints,” he said.“So, of course, we will give these recommendations careful consideration. But I would, of course, also urge our colleagues in the trade union movement to engage constructively with us and recognise the reality of the financial position.”A Treasury spokesperson said: “As is part of the usual process we are considering recommendations from the independent pay review bodies and will respond in due course.“Last year, this government accepted the independent pay review bodies’ recommendations in full, providing the first meaningful real terms pay rises for years.”Both Unison and the RCN have said they are consulting members about possible ballots for industrial action.Jo Galbraith-Marten, the RCN’s director of legal, employment and member relations, said: “This level of award will do little to turn things around. We need direct negotiations with the government, not a pay review body process from a bygone era. Any pay award must be fully funded, taking resources away from frontline services is unfair on staff and bad for patients.”Helga Pile, Unison’s head of health, said: “With so much at stake ministers need to show they value the workforce.”Daniel Kebede, the general secretary of the NEU, said the consequences of not funding a pay award were clear. “The recruitment and retention crisis will worsen, and children’s education will suffer. If the pay award for 2025-26 is not fully funded, then schools will have to make cuts which no parent, no teacher and no school leader wants to see,” he said.“The government must end the uncertainty, release the report in full, and make clear their intentions. No one wants to take strike action but of course as a trade union we do stand ready to act industrially if we need to.”Explore more on these topicsPublic sector payNHSTeachingRachel ReevesEnglandEconomic policynewsShareReuse this content"

Although it is illegal to create or share a sexually explicit image of a child, the technology enabling them remains legal, the report noted.“Children have told me they are frightened by the very idea of this technology even being available, let alone used. They fear that anyone – a stranger, a classmate, or even a friend – could use a smartphone as a way of manipulating them by creating a naked image using these bespoke apps,” the commissioner, Dame Rachel de Souza, said.“The online world is revolutionary and quickly evolving, but there is no positive reason for these particular apps to exist. They have no place in our society. Tools using deepfake technology to create naked images of children should not be legal and I’m calling on the government to take decisive action to ban them, instead of allowing them to go unchecked with extreme real-world consequences.”De Souza urged the government to introduce an AI bill that would require developers of GenAI tools to address the risks their products pose, and to roll out effective systems to remove sexually explicit deepfake images of children. This should be underpinned by policymaking that recognises deepfake sexual abuse as a form of violence against women and girls, she suggested.In the meantime, the report urges Ofcom to ensure that age verification on nudification apps is properly enforced and that social media platforms prevent sexually explicit deepfake tools being promoted to children, in line with the Online Safety Act.The report cited a 2025 survey by Girlguiding, which found that 26% of respondents aged 13 to 18 had seen a sexually explicit deepfake image of a celebrity, a friend, a teacher, or themselves.Many AI tools appear to only work on female bodies, which the report warned is fuelling a growing culture of misogyny.One 18-year-old girl told the commissioner: “The narrative of Andrew Tate and influencers like that … backed by a quite violent and becoming more influential porn industry is making it seem that AI is something that you can use so that you can always pressure people into going out with you or doing sexual acts with you.”The report noted that there is a link between deepfake abuse and suicidal ideation and PTSD, for example in the case of Mia Janin, who died by suicide in March 2021.De Souza wrote in the report that the new technology “confronts children with concepts they cannot yet understand”, and is changing “at such scale and speed that it can be overwhelming to try and get a grip on the danger they present”.Lawyers told the Guardian that they were seeing this reflected in an increase in cases of teenage boys getting arrested for sexual offences because they did not understand the consequences of what they were doing, for example experimenting with deepfakes, being in a WhatsApp chat where explicit images are circulating, or looking up porn featuring children their own age.Danielle Reece-Greenhalgh, a partner at the law firm Corker Binning who specialises in sexual offences and possession of indecent images, said the law was “trying to keep up with the explosion in accessible deepfake technology”, which was already posing “a huge problem for law enforcement trying to identify and protect victims of abuse”.She noted that app bans were “likely to stir up debate around internet freedoms”, and could have a “disproportionate impact on young men” who were playing around with AI software unaware of the consequences.Reece-Greenhalgh said that although the criminal justice system tried to take a “commonsense view and avoid criminalising young people for crimes that resemble normal teenage behaviour … that might previously have happened behind a bike shed”, arrests could be traumatic experiences and have consequences at school or in the community, as well as longer-term repercussions such as needing to be declared on an Esta form to enter the US or showing up on an advanced DBS check.Matt Hardcastle, a partner at Kingsley Napley, said there was a “minefield for young people online” around accessing unlawful sexual and violent content. He said many parents were unaware how easy it was for children to “access things that take them into a dark place quickly”, for example nudification apps.“They’re looking at it through the eyes of a child. They’re not able to see that what they’re doing is potentially illegal, as well as quite harmful to you and other people as well,” he said. “Children’s brains are still developing. They have a completely different approach to risk-taking.”Marcus Johnstone, a criminal solicitor specialising in sexual offences, said he was working with an “ever-increasing number of young people” who were drawn into these crimes. “Often parents had no idea what was going on. They’re usually young men, very rarely young females, locked away in their bedrooms and their parents think they’re gaming,” he said. “These offences didn’t exist before the internet, now most sex crimes are committed online. It’s created a forum for children to become criminals.”A government spokesperson said:“Creating, possessing or distributing child sexual abuse material, including AI-generated images, is abhorrent and illegal. Under the Online Safety Act platforms of all sizes now have to remove this kind of content, or they could face significant fines.“The UK is the first country in the world to introduce further AI child sexual abuse offences, making it illegal to possess, create or distribute AI tools designed to generate heinous child sexual abuse material.”In the UK, the NSPCC offers support to children on 0800 1111, and adults concerned about a child on 0808 800 5000.

Prevention of harassment – which makes that a legal duty for employers – is the second most popular policy after the ban on fire-and-rehire.View image in fullscreenPaul Nowak, the general secretary of the TUC, which commissioned the polling, said the employment rights bill is a ‘vote winner’.Photograph: Sean Smith/The GuardianThe reforms in the bill – which will come to the House of Lords on Tuesday – are also popular with Labour voters who have moved towards the Green party or independent MPs, increasing favourability by 11 points.Peter McLeod, who ran polling for Labour in opposition, conducted the polling with his firm Hold Sway. He said: “There’s a huge number of voters out there that still know little to nothing about this legislation. The good news for the government is that as people learn about the employment rights bill, their views toward the government get more positive.”Those polled were shown arguments in favour of the bill – including that protections were tipping the balance back towards workers – but also arguments against the changes, such as treating business as a “cash cow” and Farage’s argument that it would “ban banter”.“It’s important to note that this was a balanced exercise,” McLeod said. “To simulate the actual debate around the bill, we showed tough arguments against it as well as the changes that it will bring in and the arguments in favour. After that robust debate, favourability to the government goes up.“When we isolate the views of those crucial swing voters who picked the Tories in 2019 and Labour in 2024, we find a similar positive shift in the government’s reputation. This goes for 2024 Labour voters who would now vote Reform and Green as well.”The bill has been the subject of intensive lobbying from business groups and criticism in the national media, and linked to low growth forecasts. Critics have suggested the increased protection for workers is an additional burden for businesses who have also seen national insurance for employees increase.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The recent operations and document confirm a Februaryreportfrom Reuters, that theTrump administrationhas directed Ice to track down and deport this group.Trump officials deport two-year-old US citizen and mother of one-year-old girlRead moreMeanwhile, in Donald Trump’s second term, legal services provided to unaccompanied minors have been slashed and funds are not flowing despitecourt intervention. And the federal agency monitoring unaccompanied immigrant children has begun sharing sensitive data with Ice.The Ice document shows “ it’s not just about checking in on kids, making sure that they can account for them and that they’re not being exploited”, said Michelle Méndez, the director of legal resources and training for the National Immigration Project. “It shows they have other goals, and the goals are criminalization of the kid or criminalization of the sponsor. It’s backdoor family separation.”In addition to verifying that the children are not trafficked or exploited, the Ice document shows officials are also gathering intelligence to see whether the children are a “flight risk” or a “threat to public safety” or whether they are viable to be deported. Immigration experts and attorneys say such “fact finding” operations by Ice to track unaccompanied minors are still in their early stages.“It’s enforcement. It’s in the name of saying that they’re pursuing children’s welfare. They seem to be actually trying to conduct an enforcement operation,” said Shaina Aber, the executive director of the Acacia Center for Justice. “It seems very clear that what they are actually doing is gathering intelligence on the family.”For advocates, one of the most troubling aspects, as stated in the document, is that Ice officials will target children with alleged “gang or terrorist ties/activities”. In recent months, the Trump administration hasbeen engagingin arrests, expulsions and deportations of immigrants – mostly Salvadorians and Venezuelans – accused of having links to gangs deemed to be terrorist organizations. The administration has used flimsy evidence to justify many of the expulsions and deportations under the controversial, rarely used1798 Alien Enemies Act, or AEA, leading to ashowdownbetween the administration and the judiciary anda threatto the rule of law.“As long as the government has some nebulous allegation, they know an immigration judge will likely order the person removed,” Méndez said.Earlier this month, Ice officials visited a 16-year-old girl in Washington state for a “welfare check”. During the visit, which was firstreportedby the Spokesman-Review, the frightened girl messaged and called Samuel Smith, the director of immigrant legal aid at Manzanita House, the organization that is representing the girl in her immigration case.“Both the text messages sent and the tone of communication when talking on the phone, was of a child who was incredibly scared,” Smith said. “She had no idea what was going on and was worried that her life would be flipped upside down.”The Washington Postreportedthis month that other federal agencies have also been conducting welfare checks and reporting information to Ice.“I can appreciate the publicly stated goal, but I don’t necessarily believe it,” Smith said.According to the Ice document and a federal law enforcement source with knowledge of the operations, two offices within Ice are conducting the unaccompanied immigrant children operations: enforcement and removal operations (ERO) and homeland security investigations (HSI). The former, ERO, runs Ice’s deportation system while HSI runs mostly international criminal investigations into drug smuggling, human trafficking and fraud, but they are increasingly working together in this administration.According to the Ice document, officials from ERO and HSI will coordinate “on pursuing UAC”, which stands for “unaccompanied alien children”, while ERO will verifiy that “immigration enforcement action is taken”, if necessary.“ERO officers should remember they are to enforce final orders of removal, where possible, and HSI will pursue criminal options for UAC who have committed crimes,” the document says.Becky Wolozin, a senior attorney at the National Center for Youth Law, finds it “difficult to reconcile the alleged well-meaning intention of these visits with the reality of the terror and trauma they have caused for children and families across the country”.“Given the intent articulated in this memo, families have well-founded fear surrounding these visits,” Wolozin added.Unaccompanied immigrant children who reach the US border are apprehended by Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and then placed in custody of the office of refugee resettlement (ORR), under the department of Health and Human Services (HHS), while their immigration case proceeds. ORR will place children in shelters and later, if there is a sponsor available, children are placed under a sponsor’s care. Typically, sponsors are the children’s relatives in the US; at times, they are unrelated adults. The sponsors complete an assessment process and undergo a background check, according to areportfrom the Congressional Research Service.For years, ORR has operated independently of DHS, in an attempt to address the immigration of children in a humane manner, rather than through law enforcement.Unaccompanied minors then go through lengthy proceedings and in the meantime enroll in school.Some children released to ORR sponsors have been found to have been trafficked and exploited.“There are instances of trafficking in the United States,” Smith said. “But it’s the exception, not the rule here. The vast majority are in placements that are supportive, in a good place for them to be able to live.”For years, Trump allies have pushed the narrative that unaccompanied immigrant children have been trafficked, placing blame on the Biden administration. They have pointed to a DHS inspector generalreportthat found that Ice was not able to adequately track unaccompanied minors under their care. Experts point to a bureaucratic paperwork backlog by Ice, saying most of those children are safe, with relatives or sponsors.“The previous administration allowed many of these children who came across the border unaccompanied to be placed with sponsors who were actually smugglers and sex traffickers,” the DHS assistant secretary, Tricia McLaughlin, said in a statement. “Unlike the previous administration, President Trump and Secretary [Kristi] Noem take the responsibility to protect children seriously and will continue to work with federal law enforcement to reunite children with their families.”Since the Trump administration returned to office, HHS hascut legal servicesfor unaccompanied children. There is currently a legal fight at play, in an attempt to restore legal resources for unaccompanied minors who are attempting to stay in the US.As deportations ramp up, immigrants increasingly fear Ice check-ins: ‘All bets are off’Read moreDuring the first Trump administration, ORR began to share data with Ice regarding immigrant children and their sponsors. Similarly at that time,immigration officials arrested170 undocumented immigrants who tried to become sponsors for children in government custody.Although the Biden administration stopped the data-sharing practice, the new Trump White House has again begun the process of information sharing between agencies. A new Trump-era change now also allows for ORR toshare the legal statusof children’s sponsors with Ice, sparking fears that the information will be used to arrest and deport undocumented sponsors.ORR did not respond to a request for comment.“I worry about the trauma the kids are going through. There is a climate of fear for immigrants in this country right now,” Aber said. “The amount of trauma that this administration seems willing to put kids through is really upsetting.”The new acting director of ORR is Angie Salazar, a former Ice agent under HSI. Salazar took over the role in March after the prior acting director of ORR, another Ice official, wasoustedfrom the role.Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationChildrenTrump administrationUS domestic policyUS politicsDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

There should be a bloodbath inPakistanto teach them a lesson.”Since 25 tourists and one local guide were killed by militants last Tuesday afternoon, as they strolled peacefully through Kashmir’s verdant Baisaran valley, much of the Indian public has been baying for vengeance. It was the deadliest attack on civilians in more than two decades in India’s restive region of Kashmir. The gruesome details of the attack from survivors – that the gunmen singled out the Hindu men and ruthlessly shot them – sent shock waves of horror across the Hindu-majority country.How has India reacted to attack in Kashmir and why are tensions in region so high?Read morePressure onNarendra Modiand his Hindu nationalist government to mount a military response has continued to grow. The prime minister promised to “identify, track and punish every terrorist and their backer”.For many in India, that means only one thing: direct military action against their neighbour Pakistan, which for decades has been accused of backing and bankrolling the violent separatist insurgency in Indian-administered Kashmir as it claims the territory fully as its own. The Modi government has said Pakistan has “linkages” to last week’s attack and two of the militants allegedly responsible are Pakistani.The attack was initially claimed by a little-known insurgent group, the Kashmir Resistance Front – which India believes to be a proxy for the Pakistan-backed Lashkar-e-Taiba terror group – though it later issued a denial. In an attempt to ward off military retaliation Pakistan can ill afford as it struggles with an economic and security crisis, the country’s prime minister, Shehbaz Sharif, promised a “neutral, transparent probe” into the incident.So far, actions taken by the Modi government have included suspending the Indus waters treaty, which for six decades had been a critical water-sharing agreement for Pakistan and provides 80% of water for its agriculture. Pakistani diplomats have been summoned and expelled and visas for Pakistanis suspended. Even several Pakistani YouTube channels have been banned, including those run by former cricketers.But for many on the streets of Delhi’s busy Lajpat Nagar market, this was simply not strong enough, as the attack stoked decades-old, deep-rooted anti-Pakistan sentiment. Singh said: “Pakistan is the root of the problem, and our military should go all out to teach them a lesson. Unless we break their back, these heinous acts will continue to occur. Our prime minister has our full support; our military has our full support.”View image in fullscreenNarendra Modi has vowed to ‘identify, track and punish every terrorist and their backer’.Photograph: Press Information Bureau/ReutersIndia and Pakistan have gone to war four times since independence in 1947. The last time India took military action against Pakistan was in 2019, though that had disputed results, leading to the downing of an Indian jet.Among diplomats in Delhi, the widespread feeling was that India was preparing imminently for some form of contained military action in retaliation, which would nonetheless try to avoid escalating into a fully fledged war between the two nuclear-armed countries.Sanjiv Mehra, a retail businessman, echoed the call for a military assault on Pakistan. He said: “There must be a military strike, not only on the people who carried out this attack, but also those who are training them in Pakistan. Our government must show confidence. Death should be avenged by death.”Across India, the attack has stoked and emboldened anti-Muslim sentiment, already rife in a country that has become increasingly polarised down religious lines under the last decade of the Hindu nationalist Modi government. Over the past week, calls for boycotts of Muslims and Kashmiris have become commonplace, particularly by hardline rightwing groups accused of persecuting Muslims, which have largely been given a free rein by Modi’s Bharatiya Janata party (BJP).Vishnu Gupta, the president of prominent hardline group Hindu Sena, said: “The attack in Kashmir was an attack on Hindus, and we will respond in kind – not only against Kashmiris but against every Muslim in India if the government does not take action. There should be a complete boycott of Kashmir by tourists to teach them a lesson.“This is not merely a terrorist act but an Islamic terrorist act. If the government does not take action against the militants and their sympathisers, there will come a day when Hindus will react just as brutally against Muslims across India.”Kashmir attack sparks fear of fresh conflict between India and PakistanRead moreThis has manifested in direct attacks and violence towards Kashmiri Muslims. Students and security guards have been attacked and run out of their hostels and their jobs, and Kashmiris across the country have returned home, fearing for their safety.A Kashmiri engineering student in Punjab college, who spoke anonymously for his protection, described how he had stayed hidden in his apartment for two days after the attack, hearing that Kashmiris were being targeted, but eventually had to leave to buy groceries.He said: “First I was abused by the shopkeeper, who refused to sell to me and threatened me that I will be killed if I do not leave immediately. Later a group of men confronted me and thrashed me with sticks, punched and kicked me. They were abusing Kashmiris and threatened that I will be killed if I do not go back to Kashmir. Then my landlord asked me to vacate the apartment.”Disputed region of KashmirKashmir, in the foothills of the Himalayas, has been disputed since Pakistan came into being in 1947. Both India and Pakistan claim it in full, but each controls a section of the territory, separated by one of the world’s most heavily militarised borders: the “line of control” based on a ceasefire border established after the 1947-48 war. China controls another part in the east.India and Pakistan have gone to war two times over Kashmir, most recently in 1999.As a search for the four gunmen responsible has continued, Kashmir – which has a long history of human rights abuses inflicted at the hands of the state – has faced a draconian crackdown, with more than 1,500 people rounded up by police over the past week. Government forces have been using explosives to unilaterally demolish houses in Kashmir of those alleged to be linked to militants, an increasingly common tactic under the BJP nicknamed “bulldozer justice”.Many surrounding houses in these densely populated areas have been partially destroyed in the blasts. Fareeda Banu, whose home was damaged by the demolitions, said: “The soldiers arrived late at night and ordered everyone in the neighbourhood to gather in two houses on the outskirts.“Then they told us to cover our ears. Seconds later, a huge blast shook everything violently. Our children screamed in horror. Why are we being punished for something we had no role in?”In the aftermath of the attack, local people in Kashmir held a candlelit vigil calling for peace and condemning the attack. The region’s top elected official, Omar Abdullah, said: “The people of Kashmir have come out openly against terrorism and the murder of innocent people.” He called on the central government not to take actions that would “alienate people”.Abdullah said: “Punish the guilty, show them no mercy but don’t let innocent people become collateral damage.”Explore more on these topicsKashmirIndiaPakistanSouth and central AsiaNarendra ModifeaturesShareReuse this content"

We believe that the world believes that there is no reason to wait for May 8. And the ceasefire should be not for a few days only to resume the killing afterward.”Zelenskyy called for a “full and unconditional ceasefire for at least 30 days” to provide “a basis for real diplomacy”.“If Russia truly wants peace, it must cease fire immediately. Why wait until May 8th? If the fire can be ceased now and since any date for 30 days – so it is real, not just for a parade,” the country’s foreign secretary, Andrii Sybiha,added on social media.“Ukraine is ready to support a lasting, durable, and full ceasefire. And this is what we are constantly proposing, for at least 30 days,” he added.The White House said Donald Trump wanted to see “a permanent ceasefire” and that the US president was becoming “increasingly frustrated” with the leaders of both Russia and Ukraine.Putin, in his statement, also said he was ready to engage constructively with international partners to address the “root causes” of the conflict.For Russia, that terminology serves as code for some of its more hardline aims in a broader settlement – including preventing Ukraine from joining Nato, limiting the size of its military, and having a say over Ukraine’s domestic politics.If respected by both sides, the May ceasefire would mark the first full ceasefire since the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine more than three years ago.However, the temporary nature of the truce suggests that US efforts to broker a broader peace deal remain elusive.Russia has previously rejected a US proposal for an immediate and full 30-day halt in the fighting by imposing far-reaching conditions. Ukraine accepted it, Zelenskyy has said.Kyiv and Moscow had previously agreed to a partial Easter ceasefire, though each side accused the other of violating it. Since then, Russia has continued pounding Ukrainian cities, killing scores of civilians across the country.The announcement of the ceasefire came as the Kremlin and Pyongyangconfirmed for the first time that North Korean troops had been deployedto fight against Ukraine, following months of official silence on the widely reported deployment.Ukraine reacted with scepticism to Putin’s latest ceasefire offer and pointed out that Russia announced a similar truce over the Easter period only to massively violate it.Commentators suggested the offer was a move to avoid the embarrassing spectacle of Ukrainian long-range drones disrupting the Kremlin’s Victory Day parade on Red Square and embarrassing Russia’s president in front of international leaders in Moscow.They added that the unilateral move was clearly directed at the White House. It follows Trump’s one-on-one meeting with Zelenskyy on Friday in Rome at the pope’s funeral – hailed by both sides as “constructive”.In reality, Russia intended to continue its war, Ukraine has suggested.Anton Gerashchenko, a Ukrainian blogger and former interior ministry adviser, noted that Russiabroke its own Easter ceasefire more than 3,000 times, according to Zelenskyy.During the 30-hour period, the Russian army stopped its long-range missile attacks on Ukrainian cities. But it continued drone and artillery attacks across the frontline and even carried out infantry ground assaults, Ukrainian brigades confirmed.Russian engineering units also used the lull to repair broken crossings and to carrying out de-mining, in preparation for further offensives, they said. There was speculation on Monday that the Kremlin would begin a large-scale offensive after the Victory Day truce ended.Ukraine agreed in March to a US proposal for a 30-day ceasefire. Russia did not. Zelenskyy has called on the US and other partners to put pressure on Moscow, in order to bring about a “full and comprehensive ceasefire”.Posting on social media, the Ukrainian journalist Svitlana Morenets predicted: “Putin announcing another short-term ceasefire means only one thing: there will be no peace deal in the coming weeks. And no truce on the frontline either. Putin is just putting on a show to calm Trump down. He also needs to stop Ukrainian drones from ruining his Victory parade.”At the same time as Russia’s announcement was made on Monday, air raid sirens rang out in several parts of Ukraine, warning of strikes in the east and central Cherkasy region.In recent weeks, Russia has carried out a series of bloody missile strikes. They include an attack on Sumy – the deadliest this year –in which 35 people were killed.Last Thursday, another 12 people died in Kyiv, aftera wave of drones and ballistic missiles struck the Ukrainian capital.Putin’s ceasefire announcement comes amid mounting US frustration with Russia over its continued attacks on Ukraine.Trump urged Russia on Sunday to stop its attacks in Ukraine while his top diplomatsaid the US might walk awayfrom peace efforts if it did not see progress.“I was very disappointed that missiles were [launched] by Russia,” Trump told reporters as he travelled back to the White House. “I want [Putin] to stop shooting, sit down and sign a deal.”Although Trump has repeatedly claimed he was close to ending the war, now in its fourth year, his efforts to broker a peace between Russia and Ukraine have so far yielded little result, stalled by Moscow’s hardline demands.In a series of interviews with foreign media, Russia’s top diplomat, Sergei Lavrov, hinted that Moscow continued to maintain maximalist demands – conditions that both Ukraine and the US have repeatedly pushed back against.In an interview published with the Brazilian outlet O Globo, Lavrov said that Moscow insisted on the international recognition of its hold over Crimea, as well as the entirety of Ukraine’s Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions, as a condition for peace negotiations.Speaking to CBS a day earlier, Lavrov also pushed against future western military support for Ukraine.On 9 May, known as Victory Day, Russians celebrate the 1945 end of what they call the “Great Patriotic War”. The Victory Day parade traditionally features heavy weaponry and is intended as a display of Russian military strength, reinforcing a narrative of resilience and national pride.Explore more on these topicsRussiaEuropeUkraineSecond world warnewsShareReuse this content"

The US military had no immediate comment.The US has been conducting near-daily strikes against the Houthis since 15 March in an operation known as “Rough Rider”, seeking to end the threat it poses to vessels in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden.The Houthis started targeting Israeli and western vessels in the Red Sea in October 2023, in what they describe as solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza. The latest Houthi attack, on Saturday, targeted Israel’s Nevatim airbase with a Palestine-2 hypersonic ballistic missile. The missile was shot down by Israeli defences.View image in fullscreenRescuers transport the bodies of victims pulled from the rubble of a building hit in the strikes on Saada.Photograph: AFP/Getty ImagesGraphic footage aired by the Houthis’ al-Masirah satellite news channel in the aftermath of the strike on Sunday night showed what appeared to be dead bodies and others wounded at the detention centre.Yemen has long been a key transit country for people from Africa – mainly from Ethiopia and Somalia – trying to reach Saudi Arabia and Oman. One estimate claims there are more than 300,000 migrants across Yemen, a country devastated by a 10-year civil war. The Houthis allegedly make tens of thousands of dollars a week smuggling people over the border.Monday’s strike recalled a similar attack by a Saudi-led coalition battling the Houthis in 2022 on the same compound, which caused a collapse, killing 66 detainees and wounding 113 others, a UN report later said. The Houthis shot dead 16 detainees who fled after the strike and wounded another 50, the UN said. The Saudi-led coalition sought to justify the strike by saying the Houthis built and launched drones there, but the UN said it was known to be a detention facility.The US military has shifted tactics since the arrival of the Trump administration,which declared the Houthis as a foreign terrorist organisationin January. Since mid-March the US has mounted a much more sustained bombardment that is aimed at not only knocking out Houthi missile sites but also its political leadership, including Abdelmalek al-Houthi, the Houthi leader since 2004.In a statement early on Monday before news of the latest strike broke, US Central command said: “To preserve operational security, we have intentionally limited disclosing details of our ongoing or future operations. We are very deliberate in our operational approach, but will not reveal specifics about what we’ve done or what we will do.”View image in fullscreenA screengrab taken from a video released by the Houthi-run al-Masirah TV shows paramedics at the scene of the airstrike.Photograph: Houthis Al-Masirsah Tv/Handout/EPAIn March, Donald Trump claimed that the Houthis – the last militant group in Iran’s self-described “axis of resistance” that is capable of regularly attacking Israel – had been “decimated” by US strikes. But he also warned: “Stop shooting at US ships, and we will stop shooting at you. Otherwise, we have only just begun, and the real pain is yet to come, for both the Houthis and their sponsors in Iran.”The effectiveness of the US strikes is disputed and the Houthis in the past have shown an ability to withstand a bombardment by Saudi Arabian jets supplemented by British guidance.The UK has also been more involved in the latest US military operations than any other European country. The bulk of the US strikes have been launched from USS Harry S Truman in the Red Sea, but additional strikes were carried out by USAF B-2 bombers operating from Diego Garcia, the UK base in the Indian Ocean leased to the US.More than 750 strikes have been authorised since the decision in mid-March to raise the level of bombardment.View image in fullscreenPeople assess the damage after strikes in Saada attributed by the Houthi rebels to the US.Photograph: Mohammed Huwais/AFP/Getty ImagesThe Houthis for their part claim to have downed seven US Reaper drones in less than six weeks at a cost of more than $200m to the Pentagon.The value of the US attacks on the Houthi leadership is disputed, with some claiming the movement would not be disrupted if its leader was assassinated. The Houthis are Zaydi Shia, a branch that believes that leadership should be limited to descendants of the prophet Muhammad and that leaders must fulfil specific criteria, including being recognised religious scholars.Writing recently in the Yemen Review, Maysaa Shuja Al-Deen, a senior researcher at Sana’a Center for Strategic Studies, argued: “Without a respected local Zaydi authority figure capable of mediating or guiding the transition, the dispute would likely remain unresolved without external intervention. In this situation, Iran’s role would be key. Its political and military backing for one of the rival factions could prove decisive in shaping the group’s future direction.”Explore more on these topicsYemenHouthisUS foreign policyMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

A warrant was also obtained for the leader of Hamas’s military wing but was withdrawn after he was confirmed dead.The recent order imposing constraints on Khan comes amid tensions between the prosecutor and ICC judges over his handling of the Palestine investigation and several other cases in which he publicly announced his decision to seek warrants, a move that departed from his predecessor’s more discreet approach.Khan has in recent months said he has applied for, but not yet obtained,arrest warrants for Myanmar’s military leader, as well as theTaliban’s supreme leader and Afghanistan’s chief justice. He also indicated at a UN meeting he would seek warrants for peopleaccused of atrocities in Sudan’s West Darfur region.The flurry of announcements came as Khan faced the prospect of US economic sanctions against him – whichmaterialised in February– and in the wake ofsexual misconduct allegations against himby a member of his staff. Khan has denied the allegations, which external investigators are now examining.According to court officials with knowledge of internal discussions, the publicity generated by Khan’s statements has frustrated ICC judges and staff within the prosecutor’s office due to concerns his actions have departed from routine practice and placed pressure on the judges considering the applications.In their secret order in the Palestine case, the judges have blocked publicity that even alludes to the filing of applications for arrest warrants, and ordered Khan to refrain from disclosing any forthcoming requests unless he receives their permission.A separate panel of ICC judges had issued a similar order in at least one other case, three sources said, in an apparent sign of a wider crackdown on Khan’s approach.A spokesperson for the prosecutor said they “cannot confirm or deny the existence or content of any judicial decision which has not been made public by the court”.They said the prosecutor acted in accordance with the court’s legal framework and an arrest warrant application was “the outcome of an extensive, independent and impartial investigation in a situation under the court’s jurisdiction”.The strategy of going publicThe process for applying for ICC arrest warrants often occurs in closed proceedings. This can be to protect the integrity of investigations, ensure the safety of witnesses and victims, and improve the chances of locating and apprehending suspects.However, the prosecutor has significant autonomy and is able to publicise arrest warrant applications if, for example, it could have a deterrent effect on continuing alleged crimes and does not hinder arrest opportunities.Khan’s predecessor Fatou Bensouda revealed the existence of an arrest warrant only after it was approved by judges. The court’s first chief prosecutor, Luis Moreno Ocampo, publicly announced his intention to file applications on three occasions during his nine-year term.The international criminal court should prosecute Syria’s Assad | Kenneth RothRead moreOnce approved, an arrest warrant confirms there are “reasonable grounds to believe” the accused individual has committed a crime within the ICC’s jurisdiction, and establishes a legal mechanism to bring the accused to the court, which is based in The Hague, to stand trial.Khan first publicly announced an arrest warrant application in 2022, less than a year into his term, for suspects accused of crimes in Georgia. He repeated the strategy last year, when he revealed requests for warrants in the court’s Palestine investigation for Israeli and Hamas leaders in a dramaticvideo statementandinterview with CNN.The prosecutor’s decision to publicise the first round of arrest warrants in the Palestine case was opposed by some of Khan’s most senior staff, according to sources with knowledge of the investigation. The move, they said, placed the three judges overseeing the case under unprecedented public pressure.The panel of judges, whichapproved the warrants in November, appear to have now prevented Khan from following a similar approach when he files new arrest warrant applications in the case. Court sources said they expected the warrants to focus on alleged crimes in the West Bank.Bensouda launched the ICC’s Palestine caseas a formal criminal investigationin 2021. Khan inherited the inquiry and accelerated it after the Hamas-led 7 October attacks and Israel’s ensuing bombardment of Gaza.The investigation intensified in May 2024 with Khan’s decision to seek warrants for senior Israeli and Hamas officials, but it has continued to examine a range of other alleged crimes, both in the Gaza offensive and in theWest Bank, where there has been an intensification of Israeli settler violence and deadly military operations.The court did not respond to requests for comment.Do you have information about this story?

Trust in our democracy is damaged like never before in our country’s postwar history.”Merz,a former banker, said that Johann Wadephul, a conservative MP who has long advised Merz on foreign policy, would become the new foreign minister.Wadephul has been a supporter of military backing forUkraineand recently told the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ) newspaper the war in Ukraine “is not about a few square kilometres in Ukraine but rather the fundamental question of whether we will allow a classic war of conquest in Europe”.Merz said that despite domestic misgivings about Germany’s role in Ukraine, with some calling for a halt to weapons deliveries, there were “no ifs or buts” about its continued support. Vladimir Putin’s invasion, he said, was nothing less than a battle “against the entire political order of the European continent”.Germany, he stressed, would remain “on the side of this attacked country and therefore on the side of all people inEuropewho are committed to democracy and the rule of law … to freedom and an open society.”His statement came hours after Boris Pistorius, a social democrat who is widely expected to continue in the role as defence minister, said Donald Trump’s peace deal proposals were “akin to a capitulation”.Pistorius and Wadephul are expected to work closely together in a newly formed national security council to represent Germany on the European and international stage.In a nod to Trump but without naming him, Merz said on Monday: “We have come to the realisation that we can no longer be certain of the transatlantic relationship in the spirit of freedom and the rules-based order.”Merz and his government are due to be sworn into parliament on 6 May, ending six months of political gridlock. His conservative CDU/CSU alliance agreed a deal to coalesce with the Social Democrats (SPD) after winning a federal election on 23 February, in which the far-right populist Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) came second.The results of a poll of the SPD’s 365,000 members approving the deal is expected on Wednesday. Only once they have given the green light will the SPD announce its cabinet ministers, said the party’s co-leader Lars Klingbeil.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He would do so, he said, by tackling “irregular” immigration that had “got out of hand” over the past decade, an allusion to his predecessor Angela Merkel’s so-called open-door policy during which about 1 million refugees came to Germany.Among his surprise appointments is that of Karsten Wildberger, the chief executive of Ceconomy, the parent company of the German electronic retailers Saturn and Mediamarkt, who will head a new ministry for digitalisation and modernisation of the state.He will, in part, be responsible for deciding how a special multibillion euro fund – controversially passed by the outgoing government to boost Germany’s ailing infrastructure and its shrinking economy, as well as strengthening its defence forces – is to be spent.Explore more on these topicsGermanyEuropeFriedrich MerzUkrainenewsShareReuse this content"

Amnesty noted a climate of scapegoating migrants under Trump.Photograph: GettySacha Deshmukh,Amnesty InternationalUK’s chief executive, described the US president’s swift and deliberate targeting of international institutions designed to make the world safer and fairer as “terrifying”.“You look forward to the end of this decade and wonder whether the basic frameworks and underpinnings of not just human rights but international law will still be standing. You probably haven’t been able to say that since 1935,” he said.Amnesty’s report also documents how mass arbitrary arrests, enforced disappearances and lethal force are becoming increasingly widespread tools of repression.InBangladesh, “shoot-on-sight”orders duringstudent protestsled to hundreds of deaths;Mozambique’s disputed electionssimilarly sparked a deadly crackdown; and Turkey also imposeddraconian bans on demonstrations.The report also identified global inaction as an area of concern, particularly in relation toSudan’s ruinous civil war.

The report attempts to put a number to Musk’s many conflicts of interest through his work with his so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge), warning that he may seek to use his influence to avoid legal liability.The report, which waspublished on Mondayby Democratic members of the Senate homeland security committee’s permanent subcommittee on investigations, looked at 65 actual or potential actions against Musk across 11 separate agencies. Investigators calculated the financial liabilities Musk and his companies, such as Tesla, SpaceX and Neuralink, may face in 45 of those actions.US senator introduces conflict of interest bill aimed at Elon MuskRead moreSince Donald Trump won re-election last year and Musk took on the role of de facto head ofDogein January, ethics watchdogs and Democratic officials have warned that the Tesla CEO could use his power to oust regulators and quash investigations into his companies. In the role, Musk, the richest man in the world, holds sway over agencies that regulate or contract with his companies. The subcommittee report outlines the extent of Musk’s liabilities, which include potentially facing $1.19bn in fines to Tesla alone over allegations it made false or misleading statements about its autopilot and self-driving features.Although the report gives a total estimated amount, it also states that the $2bn-plus figure does not include how much Musk could avoid from investigations that the Trump administration declines to launch. It also excludes the potential contracts, such ascommunications dealswith his Starlink satellite internet service, that Musk’s companies could gain because of his role in the administration.“While the $2.37 billion figure represents a credible, conservative estimate, it drastically understates the true benefit Mr Musk may gain from legal risk avoidance alone as a result of his position in government,” the report states.TheTrump administrationhas downplayed concerns over Musk’s conflicts of interest in recent months, with the White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, stating in early February that he would “excuse himself” if there was any issue. Democrats havepressed the administration for answerson how Musk is addressing these conflicts, while also seeking to put theincreasingly unpopular billionaireat the forefront of their attacks against the Trump administration. The Democratic senator Jeanne Shaheen introduced a bill earlier this month targeting Musk that would prohibit awarding government contracts to companies owned by special government employees.“Despite numerous requests from members of Congress, the Trump Administration has failed to provide any relevant documents or information, the authorities relied upon for these actions, or an explanation of how Mr Musk is navigating the conflicts they inherently pose,” the report states.Musk’s conflicts span multiple agencies, including the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) which oversees SpaceX rocket launches and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), which has multiple open investigations into Tesla’s operations. In February, Dogefired workersat the NHTSA that were experts in self-driving car technology.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The subcommittee’s report issues a series of demands to Trump, executive departments and regulatory agencies to take stronger oversight action against Musk, including allowing for independent audits of major contracts given to Musk-affiliated companies.“No one individual, no matter how prominent or wealthy, is above the law,” the report states in its conclusion. “Anything less than decisive, immediate, and collective action risks America becoming a bystander to the surrender to modern oligarchy.”Explore more on these topicsElon MuskUS politicsDogeTrump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

As screenwriter, he is also known for The Bourne Legacy and Kong: Skull Island. Most recently, he has also written multiple episodes of the acclaimed Star Wars series Andor.The original show ran from 1984 to 1990 and starred Don Johnson and Philip M Thomas as leads. It was executive-produced by Michael Mann who later relaunched it on the big screen with Colin Farrell and Jamie Foxx.‘I wish I’d never written that damn movie’: Rust director Joel Souza on finishing his film after the fatal on-set shootingRead moreThe 2006 film made $164m worldwide from a $135m budget and initial mixed reviews soon turned into a stronger re-appreciation in the subsequent years. “It is operatic and grandiose – but gripping and exhilarating in a way no other film-maker could manage,” the Guardian’s Peter Bradshawwrote.Farrell later spoke negatively about the film in an interview with Total Film. “I didn’t like it so much – I thought it was style over substance and I accept a good bit of the responsibility,” he said. “It was never going to be Lethal Weapon, but I think we missed an opportunity to have a friendship that also had some elements of fun.”Kosinski made his feature film debut with 2010’s Tron: Legacy and went on to direct the sci-fi adventure Oblivion and firefighter drama Only the Brave before making the smash hit Top Gun sequel which made $1.4bn worldwide.This summer sees the release of his Brad Pitt-starring action drama F1 and he was also recently attached to a UFO conspiracy thriller which he is set to make for Apple.Explore more on these topicsFilmUS televisionCrime filmsTelevisionnewsShareReuse this content"

In that moment – an innocent, critical, life-changing moment – that tiny but monumental slip of the mind would change the course of my life for ever.”The actor describes how he believed Fries would be crushed between his snowcat and a truck was parked 10 feet away, and so leapt towards the controls in an attempt to hit the “stop” button, shouting “Not today, motherfucker” as he jumped.Instead, Renner lost his footing and was propelled on to the ice in front of the truck, “where my head hit the ground hard and instantly gashed open”.Renner continued: “There came terrible crunching sounds as 14,000lb of galvanised steel machinery slowly, inexorably, monotonously, ground over my body. It was a horrifying soundtrack.View image in fullscreenA horrifying soundtrack … Renner recovering in hospital.Photograph: Jeremy Renner InstagramRenner suffered 38 broken bones in the accident, as well as a collapsed lung and his liver was pierced by one of his broken ribs. The actor said he remained conscious throughout: “I knew that my skull was split like a watermelon, my brain pulverised like meat.”He describes in detail the pain of every one of the snowcat’s wheels and tracks passing over him and feeling his bones give way. “Skull, jaw, cheekbones, molars; fibula, tibia, lungs, eye sockets, cranium, pelvis, ulna, legs, arms, skin; crack, snap, crack, squeeze, crack. More sounds: a ringing in the ears, as if a gun had unloaded next to my head. A sting of bright white in my eyes – I was blinded by a coruscating lightning, a lightning that signals the break of my orbital bone, causing my left eyeball to violently burst out of my skull.”Fries administered first aid until emergency responders arrived and airlifted Renner to hospital. He spent two weeks there and had multiple surgeries. On his first day at home, Renner described how he headed “straight for my bar. I stood up out of my wheelchair, still on shattered legs, and poured myself a huge glass of red wine.”The actor has since regained much of his physical function, appeared in the TV show Echo and shot Wake Up Dead Man, the third Knives Out movie.His memoir is published on 29 April, and writing it was, he toldPeople, a cathartic experience.“I don’t not talk about it,” he said. “It’s part of my life every day, and it’s always a wonderful reminder of the strength of the human spirit and how fragile the body is and how badass it is at recovery.”My Next Breath by Jeremy Renner (Simon & Schuster Ltd, £22).

But can she possibly make it – and who are the scarred newbies?Graeme VirtueMon 28 Apr 2025 17.10 EDTLast modified on Mon 28 Apr 2025 17.11 EDTShareThis article contains spoilers for theThe Last of Usseason two. Please do not read unless you have seen episodes one to three.Despite growing up amid a fungal apocalypse that she alone may have the ability to undo, Ellie (Bella Ramsey) is a typical teenager in one key regard: constant sarcastic backchat. We’ve seen the unfiltered 19-year-old dish it out to friends and authority figures alike, rarely thinking twice before saying whatever is on her mind. Which makes it all the more affecting when she spends so much of this episode in pained silence, grieving for the surrogate father she helplessly watched get killed at the end oflast week’s relentless emotional wringer.With that upsetting death still very raw it might seem premature to ask who could replace Joel (Pedro Pascal), a character so central to the success ofThe Last of Us. But by the end of this episode, Ellie has claimed his revolver, ditched her beloved Converse in favour of Joel-like boots and taken charge on a two-man horse where five years ago she used to ride pillion behind him. Is she consciously trying to emulate Joel, or does she just feel compelled to leave the relative safety of Jackson Hole to avenge him? Let’s unpack what got her and Dina (Isabela Merced) on the road to Seattle.Picking up the piecesView image in fullscreenTending to his brother’s body … Gabriel Luna as Tommy.Photograph: HBO/2025 Home Box Office, Inc.After a moving scene of Tommy (Gabriel Luna) tending to his brother’s body in a makeshift morgue – and an anguished scream from Ellie as she flashes back to Joel’s murder by Abby (Kaitlyn Dever) – the action jumps to three months later. The town has been in mourning and rebuilding, but Ellie has remained in hospital throughout. Sceptical therapist Gail (Catherine O’Hara) has to sign off on her getting discharged, but after some verbal jousting she is free to return home.There she sees a shrine of flowers and tributes to Joel on their white picket fence. Inside, Ellie tentatively moves through the echoey rooms as she grapples with his absence. The sight, and smell, of Joel’s jacket and flannel shirts finally triggers the tears – although the arrival of Dina cuts that catharsis short.Dina has brought homemade cookies and some vital intel: she knows more about Joel’s killers than she has been letting on. A distinctive wolf patch suggests they are members of the Washington Liberation Front (WLF) based in Seattle. She also caught some of their names before getting knocked out: Manny, Owen, Nora and, crucially, “the girl with the braid” whose image is burned into Ellie’s memory. Her name is Abby. “Abby,” repeats Ellie, putting that name at the top of a mental kill list.A new faction?We know the shattered world ofThe Last of Usis full of trigger-happy militias and scary hordes of chittering infected. But we’ve never seen a bunch of bald whistlers armed with hammers before. A brief cutaway scene introduces us to this spiritual sect in rough cloaks advancing through a forest, as a man with a distinctive facial scar discusses the group’s philosophy with a young girl. Are they father and daughter? Or a found family like Joel and Ellie? The holy speechifying is a little opaque – something to do with a late prophet who passed down survival techniques – but it all goes out the window when a warning whistle confirms an imminent threat. Apparently the “wolves” are on the hunt, and these poor guys are the hunted.The town council decidesView image in fullscreenPutting it to a vote … the town council meeting.Photograph: HBO/2025 Home Box Office, Inc.Now she has a name and a location, Ellie is determined to pursue Joel’s killer. But if she wants resources and backup to accompany her to Seattle, she must raise the issue at a town meeting, where it will be put to a council vote. Perhaps surprisingly she has taken the advice offered by her sparring partner Jesse (Young Mazino) and prepared a written statement rather than just angrily arguing for bloody vengeance. The way she frames it, the pursuit of Joel’s killers is about seeking justice rather than exacting retribution. While it is intriguing to see Ellie operate in political mode rather than on instinct, it doesn’t do her any good: the motion to “find the people who killed Joel and execute them” is opposed by eight votes to three (I’d hazard that Tommy, Jesse and maybe even Tommy’s wife Maria were in favour). Time for plan B.Back in the saddleView image in fullscreen‘Travel light but smart’ … Isabela Merced as Dina and Bella Ramsey as Ella.Photograph: Warner Bros DiscoveryHaving scraped together meagre supplies, Ellie is all set to head out unsanctioned and alone under the cover of darkness. But Dina insists on coming along, and has already mapped out a workable route and how best to “travel light but smart”. As they are about to leave Jackson Hole, they are helped by town elder Seth (Robert John Burke). The gruff barman has had quite the arc, from being homophobic to Ellie in episode one of season two to offering his bullish support at the town meeting. Now he insists she takes his scoped rifle and extra provisions from his emergency stash.After a sombre stop at Joel’s graveside, Ellie and Dina set course north-west on what seems to be a mostly uneventful journey, although one night under canvas they playfully discusstheir dancefloor kiss at the New Year’s Eve shindig. On the outskirts of Seattle they stumble across the aftermath of what seems to be a one-sided massacre (we recognise the religious whistlers from earlier, particularly the little girl). The scene is grisly enough to make Dina throw up.Then Seattle is in sight, even if its skyline looks in rather worse shape than the old Frasier logo. Our heroes remain confident that Abby and her WLF accomplices will be easy to find. They amuse themselves by swapping badass lines from Joel’s beloved trashy action movie franchise Curtis and Viper. What Ellie and Dina don’t see is Abby’s friend Manny (Danny Ramirez) on watch atop the Space Needle, gazing down at a rolling column of WLF tactical vehicles and what looks like a formidable armed force. It’ll take more than quips to take this lot down.Notes and observationsEllie silently leaving coffee beans on Joel’s grave harks back to their opposing views on drinking the stuff in season one (back then, Ellie described the smell of coffee as “burnt shit”).Director Peter Hoar was previously responsible forseason one’s powerful but devastating episode three. Also on his recent CV:the opener of the current season of Doctor Whoand the imminent Ruby Sunday-centric episode Lucky Day.Shoutout to “Boring Scott” (as actor Haig Sutherland is credited), the guy at the town meeting who just wanted to educate everyone about the potential long-term benefits of corn production and turkey farming.Even with Dina’s optimised route, the ride from Jackson, Wyoming, to the outskirts of Seattle, Washington, is more than 850 miles. That seems like a hard shift for poor Shimmer the horse, especially with two passengers weighed down with hardtack, bear spray and an abundance of ammo.Next week? Looks like it’s time to meetJeffrey Wright’s intense-looking WLF leader Isaac.What did you think? How much did you miss the presence of Joel? Does it feel good to be back on the road again?

As such, they’ve both logged their time in superhero movies of recent vintage (though Robbie’s turn as Harley Quinn is probably better-known than whatever Sweeney found herself doing in Madame Web). It feels notable, then, that in recent weeks they’ve both been connected to multiple projects based on video games. Robbie’s Lucky Chap plans to produce a movie based onThe Sims; Sweeney, meanwhile, will produceOutRun, based on a 30-year-old arcade game, and has also signed to star in a movie based on the more recent hit gameSplit Fiction. Score a bunch of points for the gamers. Is the dawn of gamer cinema finally here?Minecraft mania: how millions of rowdy kids saved the box officeRead moreRegardless of this Hot Lady defection, superhero movies and other comics-based properties will probably stick around for years to come. Marvel still kicks off the summer movie season this week with Thunderbolts, and the MCU series in particular has probably reached (and touched) too many people to go the way of Transformers movies quite yet. Still: games are providing major competition as far as Hollywood’s favorite IP. While Marvel and DC movies have flopped left and right in the past two years, that same period has seen the release of the top three videogame-based movies of all time. That list includes A Minecraft Movie, which is stillraking in moneyeven after the Chicken Jockey riots have quieted.As with superhero cinema before its 2000s-era boom, video games provided the source material for plenty of movies over the course of several hit-or-miss decades, with an emphasis on miss: the first try at adapting Super Mario Bros into film was crushed by the summer of Jurassic Park (and its own frenetic weirdness); an attempted Tomb Raider franchise only lasted two movies (one big hit and one expensive flop); and plenty of shoot-em-up games like Doom were shot down. Adding insult to injury, many of the most popular game-related or game-imitative movies, like Wreck-It Ralph or Free Guy, weren’t based on actual games at all. Meanwhile, actual game-based hits often seemed to use those titles as a brand-name foot in the door, not depending much on their storytelling or lore; Paul WS Anderson, for example, imposed his emerging style and fixations on the six-movie Resident Evil cycle like a much lower-rent version of Tim Burton reshaping Batman to fit his own sensibilities.View image in fullscreenA still from The Super Mario Bros Movie.Photograph: Nintendo/© 2022 Nintendo and Universal StudiosThat’s not the case with the new crop of game movies. AMinecraftMovie has plenty of bits that obviously share a film-maker with Napoleon Dynamite, to be sure, but for the most part, these recent hits based on Minecraft, Super Mario Bros, Sonic the Hedgehog, and Five Nights at Freddy’s have been aimed at a crowd of super-young and dedicated fans (and, with the older games like Mario and Sonic, their nostalgic parents), sometimes to the point of not much resembling real movies to older audiences. Just as superhero movies belatedly reflected comic books’ transition to an audience that was older than their kid-stuff reputation, these new movies offer proof of just how culturally dominant video games actually are, especially for millennials, zoomers and emerging gen alpha kids. And compared with comics, which in their traditional newsstand-style form peaked well over half a century ago and have experienced major ups and downs since, the game industry hasn’t spent as much time teetering on the edge of oblivion. If it has taken a while for games to step into the Hollywood spotlight, well, decades also passed between big hit movies starring Superman, Batman and Spider-Man.This doesn’t mean that game movies are now automatic blockbusters; just ask the recent releaseUntil Dawn, adapted from a horror survival game (although, to be fair, the bar for a smaller-budget horror movie based on a less kid-friendly game is much lower). None of those aforementioned Robbie or Sweeney projects have the legacy or automatic kid appeal of Minecraft, Mario or Sonic. Minecraft and Mario in particular are part of the cultural fabric in ways that Hollywood seemed to, perhaps, collectively disbelieve. At best, they may not be great at telling the difference between a lasting cultural legacy and a fad.That’s because as much as executives can be chastised for mindless trend-chasing, they’re often enormously cautious about anything that’s genuinely new. Even the seemingly unlikely B-team that Marvel used to support its first push toward the Avengers initiative – Iron Man and Thor were hardly Spider-Man, Wolverine or the Fantastic Four – had decades of publishing history behind it. For an older executive, Minecraft might have looked like a flash in the pan; despite its relatively robust history, Chris Hemsworth has been playing Thor longer than the game has existed. As with the post-Batman slate of movies inspired by pulp superheroes of the ’30s and ’40s, rather than comics of the ’70s and ’80s, there will doubtless be movies based on games that no one under the age of 30 has actually spent much time playing. Hence Sweeney and Michael Bay getting a deal to make a movie out of OutRun, a car-racing game from 1986 that doesn’t exactly feature Mario-and-Luigi-level icons. (It would be lucky to boast a Wario.)View image in fullscreenTika Sumpter, James Marsden and Sonic in Sonic the Hedgehog.Photograph: Photo Credit: Courtesy Paramount Pictures and Sega of America/PR Handout undefinedArtistically, though, these smaller games could still prove to hold a major advantage; no one has made a great movie out of a game as beloved as Mario or Sonic, and despite their success and fan love, many recent attempts still barely clear “good”. In other words, there is still room to experiment before the process hardens into formula. While superhero comics have narrowed in their on-screen interpretations, adapting games might be a sidelong way of embracing a more diverse slate of genres. The upcomingLegend of Zelda moviecould bring back Lord of the Rings-style fantasy, while whatever the movie of The Sims is, it probably won’t be an action-adventure extravaganza. Then again, there’s always the danger that attempting to honor sometimes-janky source material will simply result in movies that feel as if they have been backwards-engineered by people who don’t actually know anything about movies.Five Nights at Freddy’s, for example, plays less like the unlocking of a cultural phenomenon, or even a competent genre movie, and more like a horror movie translated into another language, then re-translated back with such haste that everything about it feels off.Regardless, there is more where that came from;the sequel to Five Nights at Freddy’sis on its way, as are more Sonic, Mario and Minecraft movies. Surely someone (probably Nintendo) will try to forge a Marvel-style cinematic universe. The truly lingering question about the state of game-based movies is whether they bring a younger generation back to the big screen in greater numbers, or turn the moviegoing experience into a large-scale simulation – a bonus level to occasionally play through before returning home to their consoles.Explore more on these topicsFilmGamesMinecraftfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It felt like more. The first fully narrative feature by Britain’s best-loved TV sketch troupe is among the most fondly, frequently and recognisably referenced comedies in all cinema; the film’s best scenes are hard to separate from various everyday quotations or pub impressions thereof. Some comedy is made not so much to stand as individual art than to be absorbed into our collective comic language, and so it is with Monty Python, their best work a stew of endlessly imitable idioms and accents, to be relished with or without context.Monty Python’s The Meaning of Life at 40: timeless sketch comedy brillianceRead moreIn all truth, I remembered laughing atMonty Pythonand the Holy Grail more vividly than I remembered exactly what I was laughing at. For this I must blame my late father, whose laughter – loud and barking, often a beat ahead of lines already known and eagerly anticipated – I perhaps recall more vividly than my own. The film was one of a jumbled canon of comedies that, over the course of my childhood, he eagerly presented to my brother and me as apices of the form, with hit-and-miss results. (Paper Moon? Wholly shared joy. Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines? He chuckled alone.) Monty Python and the Holy Grail was among the hits: some giggling fits are too giddy not to catch on.Watching it a second time, on my own, I probably caught a good deal more of the jokes that were drowned out in my childhood, while others that I did remember – notably the famous running debate about the airspeed of a laden swallow – were more dementedly extended and involved than I might have guessed. The real surprise of this return visit, however, was the remarkable strike rate of the gags. I had expected a scattershot affair of lunatic highs and groan-worthy lows, as tends to be the pattern of sketch comedy, but the film’s antic wit is sustained better than its knowingly slipshod narrative and flashes of avant-garde style might suggest. Formally and structurally, the film may have been a chaotically experimental venture for much of the Python team – not least first-time feature directorsTerry Gilliamand Terry Jones – but minute-to-minute jokes? No uncertainty there.It could all have gone terribly wrong, of course. By 1973, when Monty Python and the Holy Grail was conceived, the team’s BBC show Monty Python’s Flying Circus was three series in and well on its way to a curious kind of status somewhere between cult and national treasure. It was popular enough to have already prompted a 1971 film spinoff that was little more than a greatest-hits compilation. Recreating numerous sketches from the show and stringing them together in an attempt to engage the elusive American market, And Now for Something Completely Different was something of a redundant curio – funny, certainly, but hardly cinematic. If the group were to have a big-screen career, they had to think beyond the short-form work they had already mastered. They had to tell a story. Sort of.Arthurian legend had enjoyed a pop culture revival ripe for spoofing: the chintzy Broadway tunes of Lerner and Loewe’s Camelot were still ringing in audiences’ ears by the early 70s, while TH White’s popular tetralogy The Once and Future King had been given the Disney treatment in The Sword in the Stone a decade prior. Reimagining King Arthur – played with wonderfully queer bluster and defensiveness by the late Graham Chapman – and his Knights of the Round Table as an alternately brutal and ineffectual band of dolts, Gilliam and Jones’s film dismantled the macho romanticism of the Matter of Britain in one fell swoop, with a simple running gag that also handily got around the lack of animal-wrangling budget: no horses and just a limp-wristed, lolloping gait and two clopping coconut halves to underline their absence.What is a knight without a steed? About as powerful as a king without a court, both of which apply to poor, hamstrung Arthur here, as he trudges vainly across England in search of who-knows-exactly-what, earning only the contempt of his sceptical, mud-stained subjects (“Just because some watery tart threw a sword at you,” one mutters) and mysteriously invading French adversaries along the way. It’s a healthily republican rejoinder to reams of awed Arthurian lore, sneaking some startlingly pithy class commentary in amid the loopy japing. “I didn’t vote for you,” says one unimpressed countryman to our horseless hero. “You don’t vote for kings,” Arthur counters, as if that answer raises no further questions.Marty at 70: the underdog best-picture winner remains hard to resistRead moreBut if sentimental historical myth-making comes in for a skewering here, so does the drab, earthy severity of the folk-horror wave in 1970s British cinema: extremities of violence and eroticism are here rendered ridiculous, even benign. Gilliam and Jones’s film may be a wilfully shaggy affair, delighting in its absurd logical leaps and blunt narrative dead ends, but it’s consistent in its undermining of rigid British storytelling traditions – not just with the gleefully vulgar anachronisms of the Carry On films, but with its own kind of gonzo political integrity.Half a century on, the film is palpably a product of its era – visible in its own stylings and those of the contemporary works it responds to – but the Python sensibility remains so strangely, dizzilysui generisthat it can’t really date all that much either. The team had more ambitious, polished films in their future: Life of Brian still carries an exhilaratingly subversive punch, while The Meaning of Life returned to the fragmented sketch format with a greater sense of perverse philosophical inquiry. Gilliam’s own flair for baroque lunacy, meanwhile, would reach artsier highs and grisly lows in his ensuing directorial career. But Monty Python and the Holy Grail remains a pure comic peak for him and the collective alike: a film made to be recited by heart, hilarious even as second-hand evocation, and still possessed of pleasures and surprises that generations of cultists haven’t yet spoiled.This article was amended on 28 April 2025 to correct the picture caption which had misnamedMichael Palinas Eric Idle.Explore more on these topicsComedy filmsMonty PythonComedyTerry GilliamEric IdleJohn CleeseMichael PalinfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Now, “excitement and energy around new and adventurous fiction is around female authors – and this is only right as a timely corrective”.“This new breed of young female authors, spearheaded by Sally Rooney et al, ushered in a renaissance for literary fiction by women, giving rise to a situation where stories by new male authors are often overlooked, with a perception that the male voice is problematic,” he said.These “overlooked narratives” might address fatherhood, masculinity, working class male experiences, sex, relationships, and “negotiating the 21st century as a man” – “precisely the narratives” that Conduit hopes to publish.Cook said conversations about toxic masculinity after the second election of Donald Trump and the popular Netflix series Adolescence means that the “subject of what young men read has become critically important”.How women conquered the world of fictionRead moreScott Preston, whose book The Borrowed Hills was shortlisted for this year’s Sunday Times young writers’ award, said “the question of why boys don’t read, and then become men who don’t read, is a big topic right now, what with the next generation of them simmering with rage online, but it’s a question I’ve been hearing for a long time.“The topics and themes that appeal to men, particularly working-class men, can sometimes be dismissed as unserious or unevolved. A book press willing to tackle that is a good start but the hard part will be cobbling together an audience out of readers who have become neglected.”The press is actively looking for a book to launch with, “preferably a debut novel by a male UK novelist under 35”, with submissions open throughout the month of May. It will aim to publish three novels, short story collections or memoirs a year beginning in spring 2026.It “can’t be over-stressed” that Conduit Books “doesn’t seek an adversarial stance”, Cook said. “Nor is the press looking to exclude writers of colour, or queer, non-binary and neurodivergent authors.”Men have not suddenly stopped reading and writing literary fiction, said Cook – rather, they are simply “not being commissioned”. He pointed to2020 datasuggesting that 78% of those in editorial roles in the publishing industry are women.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

We believe there is ambitious, funny, political and cerebral fiction by men that is being passed by.”Cook is the author of the books Byron Easy and Jacob’s Advice. He regularly reviews books for outlets including the Guardian and TLS, and teaches creative writing at Westminster University. He said that since announcing the new press, the response “has been overwhelmingly positive, especially from female authors and women who work in publishing”.Explore more on these topicsPublishingnewsShareReuse this content"

Then Covid came along and suddenly I couldn’t bear any of itKathryn BromwichMon 28 Apr 2025 06.00 EDTShareIstill remember getting my first bra. It was soft, white cotton mesh with embroidered pink flowers. It served no discernible purpose other than to make sure I wasn’t the last girl in my class to get one. But to my 12-year-old self, it signified womanhood: what glamour, what sophistication, twirling in front of the mirror. I look just like Madonna, I thought. (I did not.) After this, more or less unthinkingly, I wore a bra every day for 20 years. There was the inevitable push-up phase, the simple T-shirt bra phase, the somewhat classier black lace phase. It was a non-negotiable step of getting dressed, even if I was just lounging around the house.All this changed in March 2020. I contracted Covid, which turned into long Covid; for three and a half years my life ground to a halt. Among an ever-rotating inventory of symptoms, one of the most persistent was an intense pain in my sternum, just above my solar plexus. Every time I tried to put on a bra, it would make it even worse and I would start struggling to breathe.So, likemany women, I stopped wearing a bra in lockdown. It felt like a luxury: a brief reprieve from intricate hooks, wires digging into my skin, and straps that were somehow too tight and too loose. No wonder second-wave feminists burned them in bins. But I never doubted that, once released into the world again, I would have to strap myself back in.To avoid becoming the ‘bra-less wonder’ in Seinfeld, I needed a solutionWhen the time came to return to the office, my symptoms were still in a state of flux. Any stress or mild discomfort would bring about a flare-up, which would present itself as that sharp pain in the middle of my chest, exactly in the spot where a bra band would sit. I tried all sorts of light, airy bralettes woven from the thinnest, most organic material known to womankind. Every single one of them hurt.This soon became a problem. As much as I agreed with the “free the nipple” movement in principle, I was not ready to put it into practice in the workplace. In order to avoid becoming known as the “bra-less wonder”, as Elaine’s enemy in the comedy Seinfeld was called, I needed a solution.In what I thought would be a temporary measure, I bought some adhesive nipple covers. I did not immediately take to the pasties. They’re odd little things. “I look like a Barbie,” I complained to my unimpressed-looking husband when I first tried them on. But within a few days, I got used to them: they’re practical, they’re light, they stay put in all but the most extreme weather. Much like Shakira in her song Whenever, Wherever, I am “lucky that my breasts are small and humble”, and therefore not in need of serious support.My health has much improved; I could probably go back to wearing bras if I wanted to. But I’ve grown fond of my strange-looking pasties. In addition to the physical freedom they afford, they have also made me more comfortable in my body. It is liberating to feel I no longer need to hide behind bulky, structured cups: if there has been a loss of volume in my chest area, so be it. Like a horse unshackled from its restrictive harness after a life on the ranch, I feel as if I’ve finally broken free.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Here they are again with solutions.1. Lift-offView image in fullscreenHere are three straws. Two are connected to make a upside down V. In the image below, I have leaned the V against the other straw.View image in fullscreenUsing a fourth straw, can you find a way to lift all the straws off the table? You are allowed to hold the fourth straw, but only the fourth straw is allowed to touch any of the other straws.Solution: Place the fourth straw between the V and the other straw. Lean towards the V, catch the other straw, and raise them all. Easier to show:2. Straw polesLay out three glasses as below, where the distance between the rims of each glass is the length of a straw.View image in fullscreenUsing only the three straws, can you find a way to balance a fourth glass on the straws between the three glasses? The straws are not allowed to touch the table, and you cannot move the positions of the glasses. The fourth glass must be equidistant from each of the other glasses.SolutionView image in fullscreenI have left the three original straws on the table to show that the distance between the glasses has not changed. I took three other straws ad laid them in an interlocking triangle. At each crossing point of two straws, I needed to flatten one of the straws.View image in fullscreenAnd here is a glass on the straws – in a different colour so it is clearer to see. Paper straws are definitely strong enough – although maybe not if the glass was full of water.3.Three squareTwelve straws are organised in a naughts and crosses pattern as below.View image in fullscreenMove straws one by one to create three squares. Each of these squares must consist of four straws, and there must be no extraneous straws left that are not part of one of these squares. There’s a (fairly) obvious way to do it in four moves. But can you do it in three?SolutionThe insight here is to realize that the centre square is not one of the final squares.View image in fullscreenThe “(fairly) obvious” solution I referred to is to keep the four centre straws in place, and, for example, to move the two top left straws to complete the right top square, and the two bottom left straws to complete the bottom right square. You get a solution which is a mirror image of the above 3-straw solution.I hope you enjoyed today’s puzzles. I’ll be back in two weeks.Credits: 1. Jon Hootman. 2.

But that’s not really it, either.So it must be that the labour market is such a hellish treadmill of unending brutality that people don’t even feelsafe taking their legally allocated days off.Bingo.That’s depressing.Don’t act surprised. Look around you at the overworked, dead-eyed husks who toil around the clock in the mistaken belief that their careers might be harmed if they demonstrate even a hint of having a life outside office hours.Sir, that’s a mirror.My point still stands. There are real risks to not taking all your annual leave. The same study found that 81% of workers agree that not having a day off for months leaves them with burnout, exhaustion and poor mental health.Yikes.And it’s bad news for employers, too, since it has been reported that using all your annual leave canboost productivity by up to 40% and reduce the risk of taking sick leave by 28%.To be clear, we’re talking about UK annual leave.Yes, about 30 days a year. In the US, there isno statutory paid annual leave– any allocated paid leave is entirely at the discretion of employers, but, even then,US workers forfeited 765 million days of leave in 2023 alone.Sothe message is thatannual leave is good for everyone?Yes, and – it’s foolish to ignore it.Besides, you can use that time off to catch up on work.Wait! No! I mean, sure,57% of workers say they do exactly that“sometimes’ or “often”, because they’re scared it will reflect badly on them if they don’t. But don’t!So just … do nothing?Yes! It’s good for you. Try it now.Tried it. Started panicking about my mortality. Hated it.OK, back to work.Do say:“Please take all your available annual leave.”Don’t say:“But book a hotel with reliable wifi – I need the Q3 report next week.”Explore more on these topicsWork & careersPass notesHealth & wellbeingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

If you pull backwards, they automatically pull forwards, and that is where most dog pulling problems come from. If the lead is too long, the dog could get across the front of you and trip you over, or they can’t see you any more and they don’t really care – you are just there to be towed along.” To remedy this, Hall recommends a“J shape lead”: “If the dog’s shoulders are alongside your legs – this works for any size of dog – when you look down at your lead, it should go down slightly before it goes back up. If you’ve got a J shape lead, you’ve got enough slack for it not to be permanently tight, but it is not too long.”For some insistent dogs it won’t be enough, he says, “so say ‘no’, firmly, but never aggressively or angrily. If using a well-fitting harness, it is OK to give a little tug backward, but it is very important that it should only be a nudge, not a hefty yank.” Then, once you’ve got the setup right, he says, “don’t forget to praise them when the lead is slack. It is so common for people to forget to reward the good bits because you are waiting for the bad bit to happen.”What can I do to stop my dog being aggressive with other dogs?“Safety comes first,” says Hall. “If you are particularly concerned about this, consult a dog trainer, because it is really important that you don’t make it worse.“If you’ve got a dog that is really reactive to other dogs, distance is your friend. You can start training at a certain distance from where they have seen the other dog, but they are not yet reacting. If they are calm enough, and you’re far enough away, they will probably listen to you.”Don’t force your dog to look away from the dog that is causing them distress. “We don’t want a dog that goes through life never looking at dogs,” says Hall. “Actually, it can make it worse, because what they are thinking is ‘where is that dog? I need to woof at it and try to get it to go away.’ They will be more anxious because they can’t see what the other dog is up to.” It is far better to teach them to look at the dog and learn that they don’t have to react, praising them when they don’t.My dog chases sheep – is a shock collar ever OK?“There are lots of ways of training a dog not to chase sheep, but I wouldn’t resort to an electric shock collar,” says Hall. “When it comes to sheep, I would just keep your dog on the lead. Sheep – and dogs – are really unpredictable. Even if you think Fluffy the cockapoo would never do such a thing, you could be surprised. Sheep can be literally scared to death: if a dog runs after them playfully, that can be enough for a sheep to have a heart attack. Just don’t go there with a zapper collar. There is no need. There are better, kinder ways of training dogs.”How can I stop my dog jumping up?View image in fullscreenTeach positive behaviours … rather than focus on the negative.Photograph: Marcus Lund/Getty Images/Image Source“Jumping up is a really normal dog behaviour when dogs are excited,” says Amelia Steele,a dog trainer and behaviourist. “They want to be where you are and be close to your face. If you like it, you can let your dog jump up at you. If you don’t like it, we can prevent it and teach them to do something else,” says Steele.If it is happening outside with strangers, keep the dog on a lead and reinforce better behaviours. If it is happening in the home, consider installing a safety gate so that when a person comes into the house, there is a barrier between them and the dog, which gives time for training.“Teach an alternative behaviour first that they are really good at, such as sit or go to bed. Make that really high value for the dog, reward it a lot, and then put the two things together. When the person comes in, there is the management in place so that the dog can’t just go and jump up. Then we would look at rehearsing that behaviour that we want to enforce. It is about teaching them what you want them to do, rather than focusing on the negative.”Can I train my dog to bark less?The key, says Steele, is to look at why the dog is barking: “Are they scared of something? Are they alert barking? Are they overexcited and frustrated?” When you have figured this out, address that underlying emotion, says Steele.“If a dog was barking at other dogs on a walk, we would look at if they are scared of other dogs, and change that association, to make it positive again. When the dog looks at another dog, give them a treat, so they feel good about seeing dogs.”Some dogs naturally bark more than others, because of their breed or personality, says Steele. “I’ve got a golden retriever and a German shepherd. My German shepherd will bark at the door, while the golden retriever sits there staring blankly into space.”Can I stop my dog being so needy?“If you’re going to get a dog, expect them to want to spend time with you, because their entire genetic code is telling them to want to be with you,” says Steele. She encourages owners to change their expectations of dogs, “because I think we have the idea that we can get a dog, stick it in our house for a full day, and come back and they will be calm and chilled,” which is often anything but the case.If your dog is needy, “make sure that you are giving them enough outlets so that they feel fulfilled by the relationship that they have with you,” she says. If your dog is suffering from separation anxiety, you can help them work on their independence by building up the amount of time you spend away from them, says Steele. But she adds: “I always encourage people to do more with their dog, to build that bond, rather than try to cut it off.”I live in the city, how much exercise can I get away with?“Stop thinking of walks as how far you go and think of them as ‘outings’,” says Louise Glazebrook, a dog whisperer and author ofThe Book Your Dog Wishes You Would Read. “Our dogs deserve outings where they get to be a dog and run, play, bark, sniff, and go in bushes. Simply trekking the streets and visiting little squares of grass is a wee break, not a walk.”It can be difficult to estimate exactly how much exercise each dog needs, she adds, but consider age, activity levels and breed traits. “If you take on a working cocker spaniel, you can’t then be annoyed that it needs a gigantic amount of physical and mental stimulation and output. They are designed to be on the move and in fields working, so if you can’t meet that level of stimulation and output, your dog is going to struggle. If you choose the dog, it is your job to fulfil the dog.”I’m spending all my spare cash on dog toys. Are they necessary?View image in fullscreenAvoid cheap plastics … natural materials or edible toys are preferable.Photograph: Tierfotoagentur/Alamy“Dogs do need access to toys,” says Glazebrook. “Some are brilliant, others are cheap, contain grim materials and barely last.” She suggests avoiding microplastic-shedding nylon and to opt for natural materials or edible toys, such as pizzle sticks – a long-lasting chew that comes in different sizes. “I tend to keep some toys in a basket that mine have free access to and then I keep some that I only bring out to either play with them with, or that are treat dispensing. I do the same with chews, I believe dogs should have access to decent chews every single day. They can relieve boredom, stress and help to get rid of teething pain. I can’t bear items like the nylon chew bones – dogs chewing on cheap plastics and ingesting the particles is not what we want to be encouraging when there are excellent natural and healthy options out there.”For a homemade toy for dogs that like to rip things up, “take a kitchen roll tube, put a treat inside, then stuff each end with paper and let them shred it up,” she says.Explore more on these topicsDogsThe Guardian guide to living with dogsAnimalsPetsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Fifteen years on, she and her husband Peter have both grown – but they haven’t grown apartPaula CocozzaMon 28 Apr 2025 01.55 EDTLast modified on Mon 28 Apr 2025 09.52 EDTShareMargaret Murphyhad a lovely house in Brisbane, Australia, and four children when she noticed “a cumulative feeling” that she wanted a different sort of life from that of her husband, Peter. They had been happily married for 30 years but their children had grown up, and in the emptier house their “different expectations” became more pronounced. “I wanted to see the world before I got too old, and have adventures,” she says.So, at 56, Murphy travelled alone to the UK, where she knew no one, and at 60 started the first full-time job of her life.“Firstcareer,” she corrects herself, because Murphy, now 71, has worked for 11 years as an education officer, supporting the professional development of surgeons. “A vocation,” she says. She and Peter are still together – but on separate continents. “It’s a freer, more modern way to look at married life for older couples when all their domestic responsibilities have been taken care of,” Murphy says. “If one spouse wants something different from the other, I’ve worked out a solution.”When Murphy first headed to London in 2010, she told Peter she would return in six months to a year. But settling in a new country took longer than she thought. Early jobs were erratic, there were spells of unemployment, and she moved from house-share to house-share. One more year, she told herself – and Peter. And then another, and another.You can think outside the box as a couple. And you can get on the career ladder as an older womanShe ended up staying so long, she says, because “lots of good things have happened here”.Along with the rewarding job and new friendships, she has “learned about the diversity of other people’s lives”, and travelled in Europe and beyond. Peter visits, and they holiday together, sometimes meeting halfway, in New York or New Delhi.Murphy’s tiny flat in north-west London is the architectural opposite of her spacious house with balconies in Queensland. But, after work, when she relaxes on her sofa, having done the food shopping or paid the bills, she feels a deep sense of achievement and self-reliance.“When I came over here, I felt that it was my turn,” she says. Her mother had recently died, and there was “an opening, if you like, a new era. I could just look after myself.”Murphy grew up in Brisbane, and two of her three siblings were born with a life-limiting illness. Throughout her childhood, Murphy and her mother were thrown together in caring for them. “I felt their tragedy so much,” she says. There was a brief respite when she accompanied her mother and brother to Paris, and ended up staying behind for a few months.Soon after she returned, at 25, she met Peter at a party. They married the following year, and the year after that Murphy became a mother herself.While the children were young, she worked sporadically, teaching English as a foreign language. The children brought “a huge source of interest and fun and company; new things happening every day”.In her late 40s, struggling to find teaching work, Murphy embarked on a master’s degree, then a PhD, in linguistics. She was a student at university in Brisbane at the same time as her children; it was like being a young adult again.View image in fullscreenMargaret Murphy and her husband, Peter, on holiday in India in 2014.Photograph: Courtesy of Margaret MurphyMurphy knows that she will return to Brisbane – the house still feels like home – but she can’t say when. Some people find her choice selfish, she says. “I do feel that tension: wifely duties as opposed to doing something I want to do in later life.“But I know in my heart that what I’ve done has been rewarding. Yes, you can think outside the box as a married couple. And yes, you can get on to the career ladder as an older woman.”She has become a better decision-maker. “I’ve learned to be resilient and overcome hardships, and to look for solutions.” Most of all, she says: “I can deal with life on my own. And I have come to be more tolerant of other people.”She and Peter, for instance, are more accepting and appreciative of their respective choices. And both of their worlds have opened up a little more.Tell us: has your life taken a new direction after the age of 60?Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Telling you to stir whole peas through orzo feels a bit too much like nursery food, but if you are serving this to small children who are amenable to pesto pasta (mine are not), I’d suggest finely blitzing the pumpkin seeds before adding them to the pesto, because they’re quite large pieces otherwise. Top with seasonal asparagus and this is the perfect dinner to eat outdoors on a warm spring evening.Asparagus, pea and lemon orzottoPrep15 minCook15 minServes2Sea salt flakes180g orzo200g asparagus50ml olive oil, plus 1 tbsp extra for the asparagus180g podded fresh peas, or frozen peas50g pumpkin seeds50g parmesan, grated (a vegetarian one, if need be)Juice of½ lemonBring a large pan of well-salted water to a boil, then tip in the orzo and cook for eight minutes, or until cooked through but still a bit al dente. Drain well, and reserve a mugful of the cooking water.Meanwhile, set a griddle pan on a high heat. Toss the asparagus with a tablespoon of oil to coat, then grill for two minutes on each side (you may need to do this in batches). Transfer to a plate and scatter with some sea salt flakes.Meanwhile, blanch the peas by tipping them into a bowl of boiling water, leave to steep for two minutes (or three minutes if using frozen), then drain well. Tip the peas into a food processor, add 50ml oil, the pumpkin seeds and the grated parmesan, and blitz to a coarse paste.Try this recipe and many more of Rukmini’s recipes on the new Feast app: scan or clickherefor your free trial.Stir three-quarters of the pea pesto through the drained orzo, adding a couple of tablespoons of the pasta cooking water to loosen, if need be – you want the pasta to flow gently across the plate, rather than sit in a big heap. Taste and add lemon juice and salt as needed (if your pasta water was well salted to begin with, you shouldn’t need much).Divide the orzo between warmed shallow bowls, top with the remaining pea pesto and the griddled asparagus, and serve at once.Explore more on these topicsFoodQuick and easyMain courseSpring food and drinkVegetablesPastaCheeseNuts and seedsrecipesShareReuse this content"

But the coming days before the conclave begins on 7 May will see competing factions of Catholics, including many laypeople, campaigning in the Vatican and the US to influence the church’s future – none with more urgency than those discontented with Francis’s liberal reign.American Catholics will fight to play a central role. Soon after the news of Francis’s death reached faithful the world over, the American counter-revolution mobilized,Vaticanwatchers say. Red-eyes to Rome were booked. Long-distance phone calls were made. Various cardinals likely received sudden dinner invitations.No one involved calls it “lobbying” – that would be untoward, and it’s “subtler than what you see in DC”, Philip Lawler, a conservative Catholic writer and the author of a book critical of Francis, said. “But representatives of all points of view, from across the spectrum, will be doing their best to ensure that the cardinals understand their concerns.”Vatican power struggle: will an ‘anti-Francis’ pope emerge from conclave?Read more“I’m going to Rome on Saturday, and I’m late to the game,” Francis X Maier, a Catholic writer and the former adviser to Archbishop Charles Chaput, said last week. “There are all sorts of people already meeting with bishops and cardinals and trying to create the environment that they want.”For conservative, traditionalist or self-described “orthodox” Catholics, fresh from 12 uneasy years under Francis, this interregnum will be the last chance in a long time to try to reset a church that they believe has drifted too far left. To some, that means pushing for a church that clearly affirms polarizing but longtime Catholic teachings on sexuality, marriage and abortion. Others, many of them associated with the priorities of Donald Trump and his supporters, would go further, and press for a church that is explicitly, politically rightwing – or at least less hostile to the Maga movement’s stances on immigration, social welfare and the environment.Steve Bannon, perhaps the most public and inflammatory voice of rightwing Catholic discontent, has said he intends to organize a “show of force of traditionalists” with confrontational “wall-to-wall” media coverage. Most politicking, however, will take the form of quieter wheeling and dealing.Conservative Catholics have their papaldraft picks– Raymond Burke, Gerhard Müller, Péter Erdő and Robert Sarah are often mentioned – though observers are skeptical that the next pope will break Francis’s mold, in part because he appointed most of the cardinals who will choose his successor. Yet conservative Catholic Americans are unusually influential and wealthy, and the Vatican needs “American money and American influence”, said Massimo Faggioli, a professor of religious studies at Villanova University.And while the conservative faction is a minority, it “shouldn’t be dismissed. For them, this conclave is just one battle in a war that lasts decades.”“Do I have time to talk to the Guardian about the fake pope?” Steve Bannon asked when I reached out for an interview. “Of course I do. Always.”For years, Bannon – Trump’s former adviser and a self-described traditionalist Catholic, though he has been divorced three times – has used his massively popular political podcast, War Room, to wage blistering attacks on the Francis pontificate. He has charged the pope with being a Marxist subversive, a globalist anti-American, even illegitimate.View image in fullscreenTrump’s then-chief strategist Steve Bannon at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida, on 21 December 2016.Photograph: The Washington Post/Getty ImagesMuch of conservatives’ anger centers on Francis’s record of pronouncements that seemed to relax or render ambiguous Catholic social doctrines. In 2013, when a reporter asked Francis if there were gay men in the Vatican, he famouslyremarked: “Who am I to judge?”“‘Who am I to judge?’” Bannon repeated, incredulous. “Yo, dude, you’re the pope. That’s kind of the gig. You’re supposed to be judgmental. This ‘empathy’ is all phony. He brought the therapeutic 20th century into the church. The church is not supposed to be therapeutic.”Devout Catholics have historically been difficult to place in the American political binary. They were often anti-abortion but in favor of immigration and a social safety net. “I believe all the church teaches,” Leah Libresco Sargeant, the author of two books on her Catholic faith, told me. “I try to live up to it. And obviously that makes me a poor fit for either political party.”Lobbying for next pope heats up, with outcome less predictable than everRead moreStill, working-class Catholics were a traditional base of 20th-century Democratic party support, and activist Catholic clergy marched in protests for Black civil rights and against the Vietnam war. Yet the legalization of abortiondrovesome prominent Catholics who had previously supported leftwing causes to the conservative movement.While the stereotypical Christian conservative of popular imagination may be a Bible-thumping southern Protestant, Catholics have for years dominated the intellectual leadership of the American right. Five of the US supreme court’s six right-leaning justices are Catholic,despitethe fact that Catholics account for only about a fifth of the US population. JD Vance – the vice-president who earlier this year sparked afeud of sortswith the Vatican about immigration and compassion and also met briefly with Francis shortly before his death – converted to Catholicism in 2019.Although borderline sacrilege by normal Catholic standards, Bannon’s fulminations against Francis have found a ready audience among a demographic that the New York Post hascoined“Maga Catholics”: Catholic Americans who are militantly conservative, both theologically and politically, and see no tension.Francis did a favor to a resurgent Catholic right, Bannon argues: “His reign of terror has been nothing short of disastrous. And that’s why you’re having a massive reaction, particularly in North America, where he rejuvenated the traditional church here.”View image in fullscreenPope Francis waves to the faithful as he leaves St Peter’s Square in Vatican City, on 29 March 2015.Photograph: Franco Origlia/Getty ImagesGregory A Smith, who studies religious demography at Pew Research Center, noted that polling shows that most American Catholics – including most CatholicRepublicans– viewed Pope Francis favorably throughout his pontificate. Yet starting around 2018, an ideological gap began to open, with Catholic Republicans reporting less favorable views of Francis than Catholic Democrats.Pointedly referring to Francis mostly by his secular, pre-papal surname, Bergoglio, Bannon outlined numerous grievances.Among his arguments: that the pope washostileto the old-fashioned Latin mass liturgy beloved by some American Catholics, did not hold allegedabusersin the clergy fullyaccountable, muddled longstanding doctrines about sexuality and marriage, undermined US sovereignty by celebrating mass immigration, andbetrayedpersecuted Christians abroad by allowing the Chinese communist government control over the church there.“He’ll burn in hell just for that,” Bannon said of the agreement with China. He admitted that his stance was probably not representative of the average person in the pew.Yet many of these complaints, in more respectful form, are common to the orthodox Catholics who are the church’s most engaged, influential and financially generous constituency.Conservative Catholics got used to a certain kind of papacy and a sympathy for their causes during the 35 years of John Paul II and Pope Benedict, and some of them thought that history was overMassimo Faggioli, Villanova UniversityWhile disagreeing with some of the conservative characterizations of the state of the church, Faggioli said that American detractors of Pope Francis have momentum, to some extent, on their side. American priests starting their vocations today are on average more conservative, not less, than their older peers, he noted.Latin masses arepopularwhere they are offered. And the past couple years have seen a surpriseinfluxof young adults converting or reverting to Catholicism, many of whom seem to want “smells and bells” and moral certitude, rather than the casual Catholicism they associate with their parents’ generation, or the rainbow flag-adorned progressivism of many mainline Protestant churches.“The living and vibrant parts of the US church are not those who were most enthusiastic about the Francis pontificate, but those who have embraced the ‘all-in’Catholicismof John Paul II and Benedict XVI,” George Weigel, a neoconservative Catholic writer, told me by email as he traveled to Rome. “In the main,” he argued, “Francis’s most vocal supporters were the ageing and shrinking parts of the American church.”He contrasted the Anglican church. “[A] lot of the most engaged Catholics in the United States don’t think of the Church of England as a very impressive model of Christian vitality, and they rightly attribute its decline to its embracing a lot of contemporary culture, rather than working to convert that culture.”His views echo outside the US, as well. Recentdatasuggests that Catholics may soon outnumber Anglicans in Britain for the first time since the 16th-century Reformation, with the change driven in large part by gen-Z churchgoers, even as British society as a whole continues to become more secular.View image in fullscreenCardinals are seen as coffin of Pope Francis is transferred to St Peter’s Basilica in Vatican City, on 23 April.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesNot all conservative or orthodox Catholics were unhappy with Francis.In the magazine First Things, the conservative writer Sohrab Ahmari, who converted to Catholicism in 2016,arguedrecently that the substance of Francis’s preaching was often “far more ‘trad’ than critics appreciated”. Yet he was dogged by “the emergence of a veritable anti-Francis cottage industry” that worked to “prime a subset of Catholics against the pope”.In an email, he told me: “I personally loved the late Holy Father, and generally tried to relate to the Vatican as a medieval peasant might: pay, pray and obey.”Catholics For Catholics is one of the political faces of a newly militant Catholic right. In March, the organization hosted a prayer event at Mar-a-Lago for the second year in a row. The organization also worked tomobilizeCatholic swing-state voters for the Republican party last fall, with a particular focus on millions of “low-propensity” Catholics who don’t regularly vote.John Yep co-founded Catholics For Catholics two and a half years ago, he told me, to “advocate for Catholics in the public square, and to just reaffirm our beliefs and present them to our politicians so that they are aware of them and respect who we stand for and what we believe”.The organization is wellto the rightof the average Catholic, by most metrics, and perhaps even to the right of the average conservative Catholic: it published a book by Bishop Joseph Strickland, a Texas clergyman who wasremovedfrom office in 2023 after becoming one of Francis’s fiercest critics.Faggioli, the Villanova professor, believes that traditionalists overreacted to Francis. “Conservative Catholics got used to a certain kind of papacy and a sympathy for their causes during the 35 years of John Paul II and Pope Benedict, and some of them thought that history was over,” he said.Conclave: the Vatican’s secret process for choosing a new popeRead moreBut Yep’s political instincts about Catholics as a voting bloc may be apt. According to an AP analysis, Trumpwon54% of Catholic voters in the 2024 election, a four-point improvement on 2020, when he and Biden received roughly equal shares of the Catholic vote. And although white Catholics support Trump at higher rates than Latino Catholics, Trump also benefited from a swing in the Latino Catholic vote.Bannon believes that a rupture between traditionalist North American Catholics and the larger church is coming – and even welcomes it. Observers are skeptical of that idea, in part because most Catholics, regardless of their ideological stripe, would find the prospect of a 21st-century schism with the mother church in Rome unthinkable. But either way there seems to be a growing gap between a Catholic community in the US that is becoming more conservative and a church leadership in Rome that is open to new ideas.Faggioli believes that “in some sense, this church is already in a situation of soft schism”. But he doesn’t think a full-blown schism is in the cards.“The real goal of [most] neo-traditionalist voices is not to break away and make their own small church,” he said. “Their project is to win back the entire Catholic church, in the long term, to what they think is real Catholicism.”Explore more on these topicsRepublicansCatholicismVaticanThe papacyPope FrancisUS politicsSteve BannonfeaturesShareReuse this content"

As the driver sped away, they slowed down in the 42C heat, smiled regretfully, and waited for the next heavy duty vehicle to pass.At the peak of Boko Haram’s 15-year insurgency, bombs went off with frightening regularity at the popular Monday market. But the city –known as the birthplace of Boko Haram– has not suffered a major attack since February 2021, and the low-key security atmosphere reflected its relative tranquility.The group was founded in 2002, but its campaign of terror took off in 2009, after the killing of its founder, Mohammed Yusuf, by police in July of that year. More than 36,000 people were killed and 2.2 million others displaced. In one particularly notorious incident 11 years ago this month, Boko Haram kidnapped 276 girls from a school in the town of Chibok.Many outside the region assumed the insurgency had been extinguished, but on 8 April this year Borno’s governor, Babagana Zulum, issued a troubling warning: Boko Haram was staging a comeback. Zulum told a meeting of security agents that renewed attacks and kidnappings were occurring “almost on a daily basis without confrontation”, in a sign that the state’s authorities were “losing ground”.View image in fullscreenBabagana Zulum, the governor of Borno, left, believes that Boko Haram is resurgent.Photograph: AP Photo/APZulum made the warning less than a month after gunmen raided two military bases in Borno and his security convoyreportedly intercepteda Boko Haram ambush attempt. The number of fatalities in both cases remains unclear.In response to Zulum, a spokesperson for the military authorities said: “The military is sacrificing a lot, and our efforts should be appreciated.”Nigeria’s information minister, Mohammed Idris, also said the armed groups have been “largely dissipated”, toeing the tone of his predecessor Lai Mohammed, who in 2015 said they had been “technically defeated”.“We’re not saying that we have 100% exterminated Boko Haram,” Idris said after the security meeting. “But I think that we’ve degraded Boko Haram significantly for them to pose any kind of significant challenge for us as a country.”Zulum fired back: “I believe he is naive about what is happening in the country.”In recent years, a multinational coalition between Cameroon, Chad, Niger and Nigeria has reclaimed territory controlled by Boko Haram and helped to secure garrison towns from attacks. The group has simultaneously been weakened by a split into two factions that often fight among themselves.In January 2024, Bola Tinubu, Nigeria’s president, promised to “stamp out the remaining vestiges of Boko Haram, Ansaru, banditry and kidnapping gangs”.View image in fullscreenAid workers speak to people who have been displaced at the Muna settlement.Photograph: Eromo Egbejule/The Guardian“We won’t rest until every agent of darkness is completely rooted out,” he added.However, analysts have said troops are struggling to contain jihadists in the “Timbuktu Triangle” – a term referencing the Malian city, a former jihadist stronghold – and used to denote an area stretching from eastern Yobe state into western Borno.Beyond the attacks on army bases,local reportssaid 40 farmers were reportedly killed and several others kidnapped by Boko Haram and Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP) in January. The latter faction split to ally with Islamic State and has taken on a different style, taxing some villages and small towns that they control and remitting taxes to commanders.There are also fears that thousands of displaced households sent from camps back to their villages under a resettlement scheme may now be under threat.As long as ago as 2023 the International Crisis Group warned of the resettlement scheme: “The hasty process is endangering displaced people’s lives – putting them closer to the fighting and cutting them off from support. By exposing civilians to hardship, the government risks giving jihadist groups an opportunity to forge ties with relocated communities and draw benefits from their economic activities.”The situation in Yobe is tense. In September34 peoplewere killed in an attack, then in Marcha pro-Tinubu media outletreported that villagers in Gujba, where more than 40 studentswere massacred in 2013, had been given eviction notices by Boko Haram for helping the army defeat the jihadists in a recent battle. The authorities claimed there was “no credible intelligence” backing the report.In late March,Niger withdrew from the military coalition, prompting concerns about intelligence sharing and the capacity to keep jihadists at bay after the exit of French and American troopsfrom the Sahel. A new and much bigger regional force, established this year, is yet to get on its feet.In Maiduguri, some say the Tinubu administration has been complacent and accuse thenational security adviserof being more focused on political matters.In a clinic in the city, an aid worker who wanted to remain anonymous watched student nurses roam the hallways. “Everybody has forgotten Maiduguri,” they said.Explore more on these topicsBoko HaramNigeriaAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Red signs at the entrances of properties warned in English: “Unsafe, do not enter or occupy … entry may result in death or injury.” Hazards such as lead paint, asbestos and batteries were strewn amongst the ashes, but few workers cleaning the neighborhood that day wore masks or other personal protective equipment (PPE).Across the street, in the ashes of a home that had burned to the ground, Pedro Ramos, wore a thin blue medical mask as he picked up charred branches and placed them in a wheelbarrow. “The truth is that it’s toxic,” Ramos, who is from Guatemala, said in Spanish about the debris. “But it’s necessary to work to pay the rent and bills for my family.”In the US, after climate disasters such as fires, floods and hurricanes, it is oftenimmigrant workers who clean up and rebuild communities. In Los Angeles, it’s no different. In the burn zones of Altadena and the Palisades, many of the thousands of workers involved in clearing the debris from the megafires that killed 30 people and destroyed about 16,000 are from an immigrant background. Immigrants make up about40%of the construction workforce inCalifornia, including hazardous materials removal. Those workers are particularly vulnerable while working in potentially hazardous conditions, say advocates.View image in fullscreenVolunteers clean an apartment unit in Altadena on 13 March.Photograph: Zaydee Sanchez/The GuardianOn several visits to the Altadena burn zone in past months, it was clear that some workers involved in the cleanup had received training and PPE, but many others had not. Advocates say workers are not only risking their health, but they fear speaking out about conditions over concerns of wage theft and potential deportation amid stepped up immigration enforcement by the Trump administration.As climate disasters become more common, immigrant workers are serving as “second responders”, said Nadia Marin-Molina, co-director of the National Day Laborer Organizing Network (NDLON), which supports immigrant day laborers across the US. “It’s impossible for me to exaggerate how much disaster response and recovery in this country relies on immigrant labor in this country,” she said.Cut back your roses? Berkeley sets new rules for its most wildfire-prone areasRead moreExploitative contractorsLos Angeles is under immense pressure to rebuild. LA was already experiencing a housing crisis before the fires, and rental and housing prices have skyrocketed since the disaster. The city is also in a hurry to recover before hosting a series of mega-events: the World Cup in 2026, the Super Bowl in 2027 and theOlympics in 2028.Government officials are highlighting the speed of the cleanup. In February, the California governor, Gavin Newsom, and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)announcedEPA workers had cleared more than 9,000 properties in just 28 days – the largest wildfire waste cleanup in the agency’s history.Cleanup efforts following wildfires take place in different phases. The EPA is in charge of the first phase, in which dangerous materials like paint, cleaners and solvents, oils, batteries, pesticides, propane tanks and asbestos are removed. In the second phase, property owners have the choice to either allow the army corps of engineers to finish clearing their properties, or hire private contractors. As of 24 April, more than1,700 property ownersof about 12,000 eligible properties had opted out of the federal offer.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenTop: subcontractor cleanup crews working for the army corps of engineers remove debris from homes lost to the Eaton fire in Altadena, on 13 March.Bottom: an apartment unit being cleaned by volunteers from the Pasadena Community Job Center.Photograph: Zaydee Sanchez/The GuardianFor homes left standing in burn zones, property owners hire private contractors to clean smoke damage and replace insulation in homes that survived the fires. For all types of work in the burn zones, employers are required to provide PPE and training. That’s because the debris can be highly toxic.“There’s a really wide variety of materials [in the burn zones],” said Rachael Jones, an exposure scientist and professor in the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health’s environmental health sciences department. She said workers may be exposed to carcinogens like Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs), formaldehyde, benzene, asbestos and harmful metals such as lead, arsenic, cadmium and chromium.Soil testing hasfounddangerous levels of lead in and around the Eaton fire burn zone, likely from lead-based paint in the older housing stock in Altadena, according to the Los Angeles department of public health.Soot and ashcontainfine particles and toxic substances that can cause skin and lung irritation, shortness of breath, and exposure to carcinogens.Without proper protection, workers risk long term breathing issues, lung scarring and cancer, said Jones. Their risk level depends on how long they are working in the burn zones, and what type of PPE they are wearing.There is a spectrum of employers at the fire sites, and conditions for workers vary. The federal government has hired large contractors to carry out debris removal; those workers are properly trained and wear Tyvek suits and industrial-grade respirators.View image in fullscreenA volunteer changes hairnets.Photograph: Zaydee Sanchez/The GuardianBut there is also a secondary industry that is bypassing the formal process; contractors are picking up immigrant day laborers from the corner near Home Depot and taking them to burn zones. They are less likely to receive training and PPE, she said. “They’re the ones that I’m most worried about, because it’s just completely uncontrolled. They’re really at the mercy of the people who bring them to the site.”“[Workers] don’t necessarily have a formal employment arrangement, and that creates a lot of gray area about whose responsibility it is to ensure health and safety.” Jones said. “You end up with exploitative contractors.”Nancy Zuniga, the director of the Workers Health Program at the Institute of Popular Education of Southern California, said workers at the LA burn sites told her their employers have not provided training or PPE.After losing homes and businesses, LA wildfire victims face a hurdle to rebuilding: Trump’s tariffsRead moreOne worker said she was taken with a group of people to a burn zone, Zuniga recalled. They weren’t given PPE and were asked to pick up debris and put it in trash bags. After she finished the job, her eyes became irritated and red from exposure to the debris. “And then she didn’t get paid,” Zuniga said.Zuniga led a study on the experiences of hundreds of workers who were affected by the Woolsey fire, which raged in northernLos Angelescounty in 2018. The study found workers developed rashes and breathing problems, faced wage theft, and felt pressure to stay on the job. What happened to workers during the Woolsey fire is now repeating at a larger scale, Zuniga said.Lack of enforcementCal-Osha is the state agency responsible for regulating worker safety, but Jones, the exposure scientist at UCLA, said she was puzzled by the agency’s apparent lack of enforcement at the burn sites.“These sites aren’t that big,” she said. “It’s not like you can’t drive through them in an afternoon and stop and look at what’s happening. Many of us are wondering why there hasn’t been a more aggressive approach to this?”California’s department of industrial relations, which includes Cal-Osha, said it has participated in hundreds of outreach events and deployed teams to fire-impacted areas to reach homeowners and small-business contractors. The department said it is supporting worker rights and safety by providing $6m in funding to 21 community groups in Los Angeles through the California Workplace Outreach Project.View image in fullscreenSubcontractor cleanup crews working for the army corps of engineers remove debris from homes lost to the Eaton fire in Altadena, on 13 March.Photograph: Zaydee Sanchez/The GuardianEmployers are required to conduct worksite risk assessments, implement necessary safety measures, train workers to prevent exposure to hazards, and provide PPE, department spokesperson Denisse Gomez said. Employers engaged in fire debris removal must comply with title 8 of the California code of regulations, which outlines legal standards for workplace safety.If a homeowner declines the offer of a no-cost, government-led cleanup, the homeowner or contractor is accountable for any issues that arise, such as permitting, environmental protections and worker safety, Gomez added.LA county facing financial turmoil after wildfires and $4bn abuse settlementRead more“The Department of Industrial Relations (DIR) helps protect workers on the frontlines of disaster recovery – regardless of immigration status,” Gomez wrote in an email.Some workers have received Osha training. On 13 March in Altadena, four men in Tyvek suits, goggles, masks and gloves cleaned a smoke-damaged apartment. The building was surrounded by the blackened debris of homes that had burned to the ground. But the workers knew how to protect themselves; they had received PPE and Osha training through the Pasadena Community Job Center.Taking a break from cleaning, Cesar Saucedo said he knew workers who were picked up from a corner near Home Depot and taken to a burn zone but provided no training or PPE. “On the weekend, we went to a corner, where a group of workers were hired by a company for $17 an hour. They had no Osha training and the company gave them nothing,” he said in Spanish.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenTop: César Saucedo cleans a home in Altadena.Bottom: volunteers in a home in Altadena.Photograph: Zaydee Sanchez/The GuardianMarin-Molina, of NDLON, said that in the rush to recover, few employers take the time to train workers on the hazards they will encounter when cleaning up after climate disasters.NDLONsurveyedworkers who cleaned up after Hurricane Ida hit New Orleans in 2021 and found that only 15% of day laborers working in hurricane-affected areas in New Orleans received required training. More than 90% reported wage theft while doing post-disaster recovery work. One study found that one in four workers who cleaned up after Hurricane Katrina were undocumented.Marin-Molina explained that often it’s large national companies that hire day laborers through layers of subcontractors. The climate crisis has become lucrative forlarge disaster cleanup companies, who shield themselves from accountability by using subcontractors. “Under those layers, it’s the undocumented workforce that’s holding this all up,” Marin-Molina said.Jones said the vulnerability of immigrant workers and lack of enforcement is nothing new. “It’s a longstanding uphill battle, and I think the fires are just making it more visible,” she said.Explore more on these topicsCalifornia wildfiresLos AngelesExtreme weatherGavin NewsomHousingWest CoastUS Environmental Protection AgencyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But jobs in the EV industry could be affected by Trump’s war on clean energyKavitha Cardoza in Kansas CityMon 28 Apr 2025 07.00 EDTShareIn aKansasCity classroom, 20 students were learning how basic circuit boards work. They fiddled with knobs, switches, levers and wires; if they got the connections right, tiny light bulbs glowed.The students, recruited for the opportunity by Panasonic, were participants in an eight-week apprenticeship course that involved classes at the community college and on-the-job training. When they’re done, they will be among the first workers at the company’s new electric vehicle battery factory in nearby De Soto,Kansas. The $4bn manufacturing plant – touted as thelargest EV battery factory in the world– is expected to open in early summer and eventually employ roughly 4,000 people. Panasonic also paid for the students’ tuition, as well as the instructor’s salary.Apprenticeship programs like this one have been heralded as the future of workforce development. Born out of partnerships between industry and community colleges, these short-term programs offer credentials closely aligned with employer needs and are often referred to as the pathway to high-skill, high-demand, high-wage jobs. In this case, Panasonic and two Kansas colleges created theirs in a matter of months, adapting an existing curriculum to meet factory demand.“We’re helping them build their workforce from the very beginning,” said Greg Mosier, the president of Kansas City Kansas Community College (KCKCC).During the Biden administration, the federal government invested billions of dollars to help build and expand domestic electric vehicle and battery production.But theTrump administrationhas thrown this career pathway into uncertainty. On his first day in office,Donald Trumpsignedan executive orderthat scrapped a Biden administration goal that half of all new cars sold in the US by 2030 be electric; called for the elimination of tax credits for the vehicles; and pushed to undo regulations around pollution and fuel economy standards. Trump also paused federal funding to build electric vehicle chargers,ordered thousands of stations disconnected at government sitesand tried to freeze spending on clean energy projects.View image in fullscreenOne-semester Automation Engineer Technology students create electrical circuits in a lab at the Kansas City Kansas Community College Technical Education Center.Photograph: Zac Clingenpeel for The Hechinger ReportA Princetonanalysissaid these changes would wipe out demand for new electric vehicle manufacturing in the United States, causing electric vehicle battery sales to drop by about 40% by 2030 and putting half of the existing plants at risk of closure. In the final quarter of 2024, EVsmade up more than 8%of all vehicle sales.After initially agreeing to let a reporter access the classes it started at KCKCC and talk with students, instructors and a Panasonic representative canceled that offer without explanation, and did not respond to subsequent interview requests.Few state leaders were willing to speak about how the federal policy changes would affect community colleges and businesses in the state. Kansas governor Laura Kelly, a Democrat, declined to comment. Representative Sharice Davids, a Democrat who represents the congressional district where the Panasonic facility is being built, called Trump’s decision to roll back tax credits “harmful”. In a statement to the Hechinger Report, she said the president’s executive orders “throw uncertainty into the mix, not just for Panasonic but for every worker, supplier, and small business that stands to benefit”.In recent years, community colleges have led the charge to build a skilled workforce for electric car companies and their suppliers, for jobs that often require some postsecondary education but not a four-year degree.Pima Community College in Arizona,Richland Community College in Illinois,Wake Technical Community College in North CarolinaandRio Hondo College in Californiaare among the institutions that have started such programs.The American Association of Community Colleges (AACC) operates an Electric Vehicles Hub – in partnership with Tesla and Panasonic and funded with $8m in federal dollars – that helps colleges share best practices and track student outcomes. There are a limited number of qualified instructors for these programs, and they require specialized equipment and computer programs that are expensive, said Martha Parham, who heads communications for the community college association. The KCKCC program’s lab, with its specialized computer programs and equipment, cost $5m.View image in fullscreenGreg Mosier, the president of Kansas City Kansas Community College, stands outside the school’s career and technical education center.Photograph: Zac Clingenpeel for The Hechinger ReportKCKCC took an existing two-year curriculum in advanced manufacturing and initially created a 16-week course that included both classroom instruction and practical training. But Panasonic couldn’t wait that long, said Mosier: “To ramp up, they really needed to get people going at a faster rate.”So the college, along with another local college, Johnson County Community College (JCCC), worked with Panasonic to understand exactly which employee skills it needed immediately and then shortened the course to eight weeks – effectively doubling the number of students who could participate. KCKCC and JCCC plan to cycle a combined 200 students through this entry-level course each year. The starting salary is expected to be more than $50,000.JCCC, whose program will begin in June, is working to train Panasonic supervisors as instructors, who will then transition as supervisors when the class moves to the factory floor. “So they will have a familiar face and someone who understands their skill set,” said L Michael McCloud, the provost. The credentials are also stackable, meaning they will count toward a two-year associate degree at both colleges. In addition, JCCC developed an agreement with Kansas State University to recognize the credentials as part of a bachelor’s degree in engineering technology.Panasonic also sponsors students in other KCKCC classes, including an associate degree class in automation engineering. Justin Jefferson, a student in that class, said he signed up too late to secure one of the Panasonic spots, about half the class. Still, he is determined to work at the company once he graduates: “Panasonic is preparing for the future,” he said.View image in fullscreenAC/DC Electrical systems sit on tables in a lab at the Kansas City Kansas Community College Technical Education Center.Photograph: Zac Clingenpeel for The Hechinger ReportJefferson, 38, has held several jobs over the years, including as a butcher and as a health aide; now, more than anything, he wants stability. “That way I won’t have to deal with the stress of not having enough or just having enough,” he said. His classmates range in age from recent high school graduates to career switchers in their 50s.McCloud said staff have been fielding calls daily from people asking about Panasonic offerings. Local school district superintendents have reached out too, he said, to learn how their students can get a leg up in applying for Panasonic jobs.Although community colleges have not been the focus of Trump’s cuts to and attacks on higher education institutions, they are potentially vulnerable. During the 2022-23 school year, nearly 15% of community college budgetscame fromfederal sources. In addition, 48% of the roughly 10.5 million community college students in 2020 received some sort of federal aid.At her confirmation, Trump’s education secretary, Linda McMahon, said she supports expanding postsecondary education and training pathways, including apprenticeships. At the same time, though, the Trump administration has canceled some grants for apprenticeship programs and research projects and terminated theadvisory committee on apprenticeship. The labor and of education departments did not respond to interview requests.On a weekday in February, the site of the sprawling new Panasonic facility in downtown De Soto was abuzz with activity. It sits on the former Sunflower Army Ammunition Plant, abandoned since the early 1990s. “There was a lot of blight,” said Rick Walker, the part-time mayor of De Soto, a community of 6,500. Residents worried about what would become of the site, Walker recalled. “Was it just going to be this zombie wasteland forever?”Today, construction workers, cranes and cement trucks crowd the nearly 5m sq ftf building site. At lunchtime, a nearby Mexican restaurant was packed with some of the 3,300 workers hired to build the plant. Four new eateries have opened. A struggling grocery store is busy again. New apartment units are fully occupied. Since Panasonic arrived, the town has had a 130% increase in sales tax revenue, which has allowed city leaders to cut property taxes by a third, said Walker.View image in fullscreenA lot lies under construction in downtown Kansas City, Kansas, on 4 February.Photograph: Zac Clingenpeel for The Hechinger ReportGreg LeRoy, the executive director of Good Jobs First, a watchdog group that tracks corporate subsidies, points out that there isa lot of public moneyat stake. To attract the company, the Kansas Legislature created an incentive program awarding Panasonic more than $829m in tax credits, payroll reimbursement, workforce training and sales tax exemptions on construction materials. It’s also eligible for federal corporate income tax credits, which he estimated at $6.8bn. LeRoy said the public money is tied to output, which is less certain because of the federal policy shift. “If they don’t produce, they’re not going to get the credits,” he said.Local governments in Kansas are shouldering the greatest risk, he said, because they’ve had to spend millions of dollars up front – preparing land for development, building and widening roads, and installing new utility hookups. “They had to build an entire new fire station because this plant has special fire risks associated with it,” he said. As a cautionary tale, LeRoy cited FoxConn, whose much-touted Wisconsin factoryremains largely undeveloped, costing local governments about $300m in land rights, water mains, roads, eminent domain purchases and other expenses.Walker, the De Soto mayor, said his city has put in $2m to date, to widen roads, which leveraged an additional $60m in state funds. “Even if Panasonic shuttered their doors before they open, we’re not going to go bankrupt,” he said. The company has funded much of the infrastructure work through a Tax Increment Financing district designation, he said, which freezes taxes at a pre-development level and diverts future tax revenue for infrastructure improvements. Panasonic is occupying just 300 acres of the 9,000-acre (3,600-hectare) site, Walker said, and he hopes the infrastructure improvements will attract other companies.If the demand for electric vehicles falls, it could lead to less investment in training, fewer jobs and poorer economic prospects for states like Kansas. But many people here in this region, which voted decisively for Trump in 2016, 2020 and 2024, didn’t seem concerned as yet. Especially in the Kansas City area, “EVs are here to stay” was a common refrain.Walker, who is also an engineer, said he said he was “distressed” to read about the federal government’s decision to move away from battery-operated cars. “Electric cars are much more efficient, it’s not just about the environment,” he said. Still, he believes the adoption of electric vehicles is inevitable. “While the demand or sales may be slower, I don’t see that flatlining or reversing.”JCCC’s McCloud acknowledged the fear, but said he hasn’t heard “any broad concerns about the viability of the factory”. He added: “While this plant is designed around batteries that would function for electric vehicles, it’s my understanding that those power sources will possibly also be useful in other ways.” Mosier from KCKCC, said he didn’t think a “couple of actions at the federal level” would shut efforts down.Jefferson, the KCKCC student, also remains optimistic about the long-term prospects of the EV battery factory and his potential future in it. “You know you read stories about people who worked at General Motors for 20 or 30 years and do OK?” he said. “That’s my goal.”Thisstory about apprenticeshipswas produced bythe Hechinger Report, a non-profit, independent news organization focused on inequality and innovation in education.

Bush also, when compared to Trump, had a more liberal immigration policy, including supportingproviding undocumented immigrantsthe chance to become citizens, according to John Fea, a history professor at Messiah College in Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania, and the author of Believe Me: The Evangelical Road to Donald Trump.“Bush wasn’t willing to give them everything that they wanted to be elected,” Fea said. “Trump will do what evangelicals tell him to do for the most part, in order to maintain power.”In addition toappointing supreme court justiceswho ruled that there is no constitutional right to abortion, Trump also moved the embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, which previouspresidentshad said they supported but did not implement.“They all said it to get votes. They never did it. The president did it,” said Lahmeyer, who ran for Senate and lost in 2022.During this term, Trump hassigned executive ordersto establish a faith office and ataskforceto address “anti-Christian bias” in the federal government.To evangelical leaders, that emphasis on Christian values stands in contrast to how they perceive the Biden administration’s actions, including in 2024 declaring 31 March Transgender Day of Visibility, the date when it had been celebrated since its creation in 2009, but last year fell – entirely coincidentally – on Easter Sunday.But in a world where conspiracy theories and misinformation is rife, that sparked anger among rightwing Christians.“Easter was barely mentioned,” said Brad Sherman, an Iowa pastor and Republican now running for governor. “In fact, I think it was more about some kind of LGBTQ awareness day or something, if I remember correctly, so I just feel like President Trump is standing up for Christian values.”In actual fact, Biden continued the tradition of the annual White House Easter egg roll and in astatement said: “As we gather with loved ones, we remember Jesus’s sacrifice … with wars and conflict taking a toll on innocent lives around the world, we renew our commitment to work for peace, security, and dignity for all people.”This year, Trump held an Easter prayer service and dinner with Lahmeyer; prominent pastors such as Franklin Graham and Robert Jeffress; and his personal pastor, Paula White-Cain, who now leads the White House faith office, among others.“[Trump] preached the gospel to us pastors, and I thought that was amazing,” Lahmeyer said.While most white evangelicals support Trump, there are Christian leaders, including evangelicals, who have criticized some of the president’s policy decisions, especially to eliminate 83% of US Agency for International Development (USAID) programs. Among the initiatives affected was the President’s Emergency Plan for Aids Relief (Pepfar), which has saved millions of lives fromHIV/Aidsand was popular with evangelicals.“We see it as really overarchingly a pro-life program in that it promotes the life-saving need for HIV treatment,” Emily Chambers Sharpe, the health director at World Relief, the humanitarian arm of the National Association of Evangelicals,told the Guardian.But the person behind many of the federal government cuts, Elon Musk, head of the so-called “department of government efficiency”, called USAID a “criminal organization” and said that it was “time for it to die”.Adam Russell Taylor, the president of Sojourners, a Christian social justice group, said such remarks remind him of “the prophet Isaiah, who forewarned us that woe to you that call evil, good, and good, evil”.The administration is “making these allegations that aren’t backed up by evidence or proof. And they disparage this whole body of work that has created such goodwill around the world and is so aligned with our Christian values,” Russell Taylor said.But many American evangelicals continue to support Trump despite such cuts, because concern for the poor “always takes a back seat in evangelical politics to abortion [and] control of the supreme court, which will allow them to have the religious freedom that they want”, said Fea, the history professor.Tony Suárez, the founder of Revivalmakers Ministries, an evangelical group, said he supports Trump because he is trying to strengthen border security and is restoring “respect for conservative, Judeo-Christian values”.Trump’s taskforce order is latest in efforts to boost Christian nationalismRead moreOnce the country secures the border and removes “the criminal element”, Suárez, who is also executive vice-president of the National Hispanic Christian Leadership Conference, said he would like to see a pathway to at least legal permanent residency for undocumented immigrants. He thinks that based on some of hiscommentsduring his first term, Trump would support that too.But Trump also wants to end birthright citizenship for the children of undocumented immigrants and foreign residents, a guarantee under the 14th amendment.Asked for his position on this, Suárez said that is “a little bit above me to understand what it is specifically that they are arguing”.And on cuts to foreign aid programs, Suárez said he views them “as difficult decisions that any organization, denomination, reformation, might have to take, and they will never be popular”.Suárez joked that the only thing he disagrees with Trump on is him saying that “you may even get tired of winning”.“I’m not tired,” Suárez said. “I’m looking for the next win.”Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpChristianityReligionUS politicsEvangelical ChristianitynewsShareReuse this content"

She is now organizing an event to bring together young residents and Black officers that she hopes will lead to safer interactions on the street.“I hope what I do touches people’s hearts and that changes their behavior,” she said.Yet, the threat of the Cleveland suburb losing a federal grant because of her work only becomes more palpable as her friends and colleagues in the field of DEI lose their jobs – and the work they’ve dedicated their lives to hemorrhages esteem. “I’m just not the person who’s gonna operate in fear,” she said. “But I am a person who operates in reality.”View image in fullscreenColleen Jackson was hired by the city of Shaker Heights, Ohio, to be its first diversity, equity and inclusion officer.Photograph: Daniel Lozada/Daniel Lozada for The Marshall ProjectThere is a growing realization among DEI professionals such as Jackson and police officers across the country that a backlash is gaining momentum.Donald Trump, who has called DEI “illegal”, has halted federal programs and encouraged executive branch agencies to investigate and withhold funds from institutions that engage in DEI practices.The new administration has threatened to pull federal funding to compel policy changes in other areas of American life, such as universities, but policing experts are skeptical that a similar tactic would work on the nation’s roughly 17,000 local and state law enforcement agencies, particularly because they draw most of their funds from local taxes.Still, Trump’s actions are already having an impact, contributing negatively to the culture in police departments by “encouraging tension within the ranks”, said Jenn Rolnick Borchetta, the American Civil Liberties Union’s deputy project director of policing. Opposition to diverse perspectives, she said, can breed an insular culture prone to abuse of underrepresented groups.‘Guess what? You don’t matter’: what Trump’s war on DEI means for every American who’s not a straight white manRead more“This is not merely about the threat to diversity in policing,” Borchetta said. “That threat can spill out into the street.”Increasing diversity among the ranks isn’t a panacea for police abuse – think of the case of Tyre Nichols, a Black man in Memphis, Tennessee, who died after being beaten by several Black officers. Still, policing experts say, hiring a more diverse force combined with efforts to change the culture within departments can help.Trump’s anti-DEI push is not the first time efforts to diversify policing have faced a backlash. Black officers hired in the south during Reconstruction lost their jobs in the late 1800s when the federal government relinquished its control over former Confederate states. Later in the 1970s, after the civil rights movement era, federal efforts to force several big-city police departments to diversify faced opposition from white-dominated police unions. By the 1990s, most of these federal efforts were terminated.According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, after Floyd’s murder in 2020 and the rise of DEI in policing, the number of Black officers hit its high-water mark in 2022, constituting 17% of the nation’s rank-and-file cops before falling to 14% last year, which is about the number of Black Americans in the country. In2024, white people made up more than 79% of police officers and women made up more than 14%.Although law enforcement diversity and inclusion experts such as Nicola Smith-Kea maintain that DEI is about more than race – it’s about including people with different abilities, genders, faiths and ages – Smith-Kea thinks Trump has transformed the acronym into a “code word” for Black, creating a framing that DEI is discriminatory against white officers.Smith-Kea said a backlash could mean “removing programs” that serve “the broader population, not just any one race”, such as accessibility ramps for disabled people or equal pay programs for women.In February, the US attorney general, Pam Bondi, dismissed Biden-era lawsuits that accused police departments of hiring discrimination. Bondi dropped a case against the Maryland state police (MSP) before an agreement could be signed that would have required MSP to revise a test that Biden’s justice department found disproportionately disqualified Black and female applicants.A lot of us are preparing for the fair competition fostered by DEI to be eliminatedCharles Billups, Grand Council of GuardiansIn her dismissal, Bondi said police officers would now be “chosen for their skill and dedication to public safety – not to meet DEI quotas”.Phillip Atiba Solomon, the chief executive of the Center for Policing Equity, an organization that collects and analyzes public safety data to improve policing outcomes, said he wondered whether the Trump administration might try to use the Department of Justice to investigate police departments with DEI programs for “reverse racism”.Although Trump might have the power to quickly transform the executive branch, lawyer James Fett believes that it will take more time for the federal courts to turn against DEI. Fett, who frequently represents white officers who say they have faced employment discrimination, is eagerly awaiting the disposition of a case now with the US supreme courtfiled by a womanwho claims she was denied a promotion with the Ohio department of youth services because she is not gay.If the conservative court rules in her favor, experts believe it could lower the standard that straight, white people will have to meet to prove they have faced employment discrimination. “It’s going to be much easier when people want to attack promotions or hiring or even terminations based on a DEI policy,” Fett said.Charles Billups of the Grand Council of Guardians, the umbrella organization for New York state’s African American policing organizations, said he and many of his members fear that Trump’s anti-DEI orders could roll back the progress they’ve seen in hiring and promotions. “A lot of us are preparing for the fair competition fostered by DEI to be eliminated,” he said.‘Very retaliatory’: the federal workers caught up in Trump’s DEI purgeRead moreEven before Trump, some DEI professionals said they were facing pushback.Delaware county,Pennsylvania, hired Lauren Footman as its first DEI director in spring 2022. Included in her purview were the park police and law enforcement officials within the local prosecutor’s office. She said she felt tokenized right away in a department that was not interested in cultural change and only supportive of hosting parties for identity celebrations such as Black History Month.“Someone in HR actually thought that I was an event coordinator,” she said. During her time, she never worked with the park police or criminal investigation division because she says that Delaware county did not compel them to participate.Footman was fired in the spring of 2024. She says the termination was retaliation for her attempts to address the county’s culture of discrimination and she is currently pursuing legal action. When asked about Footman’s claims, Delaware county said that after her termination, the county worked with a consultant to evaluate its programs and make recommendations. However, county officials vigorously denied her accusations.Even in departments where DEI appears to have support, it can fall short. Veteran Sgt Charlotte Djossou believes that is the case in the DC Metropolitan police department (MPD).View image in fullscreenSgt Charlotte Djossou is a veteran of the Metropolitan police department in Washington DC.Photograph: Dee Dwyer/Dee Dwyer for The Marshall ProjectDjossou is a whistleblower who has been speaking out since the 2010s against the racial targeting in the MPD’s jump-out tactics, which involve plain clothes units accosting and searching people on the street. The courts have repeatedly found jump-outs to be discriminatory and unconstitutional. When Djossou first talked about them in the news media, she attributed their pervasiveness to the lack of Black officers in positions of power.But while she has seen more Black people hired and promoted due to DEI, she doesn’t believe it has altered the way the Black community is policed. “It’s not a Black or white thing. It’s a blue thing. And no matter what your race is, in policing, you have to conform in order to move up,” Djossou said.Djossou has filed a lawsuit against the MPD claiming it retaliated against her for whistleblowing by denying her promotions during a time when the department has been engaged in a high-profile DEI campaign to recruit and hire women. That DEI effort was shepherded by Chief Pamela A Smith, who initially joined the MPD in 2022 as its chief equity officer in the aftermath of Floyd’s murder.It’s going to be much easier when people want to attack promotions or hiring or even terminations based on a DEI policyJames Fett, lawyer“I’m Black. I’m a woman. And all they’ve done is hold my career back,” Djossou said. The MPD did not respond to a request for comment.Smith-Kea understands the frustration some reform-oriented officers might have had with DEI. “Change doesn’t happen overnight,” she said, but there are advances, pointing to the widely used toolkit she helped develop for the Bureau of Justice Assistance, which instructs departments on how to implement interventions for dealing with people in a mental health crisis.Tragic killings like that ofDaniel Prudehave revealed the interplay between race and mental health in fatal police interactions. Prude was apprehended by Rochester, New York, police in the midst of a mental health crisis in 2020 and died of asphyxia after police put a mesh hood over his face and pinned him on the ground. Smith-Kea believes DEI-rooted solutions can prevent deaths like Prude’s. As an example, she points to the BJA toolkit’s potential to make all people, not just Black people, safer.Despite all the worries about DEI’s fate in policing, the ACLU’s Borchetta said departments have incentives to keep DEI because many learned in the 2020s that to solve crimes they “need to gain the trust of the people and that trust is more easily eroded when police departments don’t reflect the people they’re policing”.American corporations didn’t want to diversify, anywayRead moreBorchetta noted that police departments also learned to use diversity to avoid accountability. She was the lead attorney in the case that brought an end to the New York police department’s unconstitutional practice of stop and frisk in 2013. While working on that case, she said, one of the NYPD’s key defenses was simply: “See how diverse our department is.”However, she also credited that diversity with helping to win the case, including the contribution of Latino and Black officers who raised alarms about stop-and-frisk. “That’s a reminder that diversity is important because it brings in perspectives of people who might be affected by your program in different ways,” she said.In Shaker Heights, where the mayor has vowed to continue its DEI initiatives, Jackson was optimistic about the future of DEI in policing. She believed that her work had touched people, and that kind of personal impact couldn’t just be erased with an executive order. She said she was certain she and other DEI professionals would continue the work, regardless of Trump’s efforts.“I recognize these executive orders could bring the end of this particular name for the work – DEI – but it doesn’t mean the work will stop,” Jackson said. When asked how she could be so sure, she said: “The work of DEI has been going on for generations. It’s the only reason why I, as a Black woman, have a job in the public sector, you know what I mean?”This article was published in partnership withthe Marshall Project, a non-profit news organization covering the UScriminal justice system.

But these fish are on a mission.When fully grown, they will produce offspring that will be the first to be launched into space as part of a scientific project called Lunar Hatch that is exploring whether sea bass can be farmed on the moon – and eventually Mars – as food for future astronauts.The project is the brainchild of Dr Cyrille Przybyla, a researcher in marine biology for the French National Institute for Ocean Research, who will be watching their progress like any anxious parent.“Fish is an excellent source of protein because it is the animal organism that we digest the best and it has omega 3 and important B vitamins that will be needed for astronauts in space to maintain muscle mass,” Przybyla says. “The question was: how can we produce food that far away?”View image in fullscreenThe Lunar Hatch project is researching whether sea bass could be farmed on the moon as a source of protein for astronauts.Photograph: O Barbaroux/lfremerThe answer is, he says, to blast the eggs into space where they will hatch in the time it takes to get to the InternationalSpaceStation (ISS). Initially, the fish will simply be observed before being frozen and returned to Earth but eventually the idea is that they will be farmed on the moon.Przybyla is confident that should the world’s space agencies decide to build a moon base, Lunar Hatch will be able to put sea bass on the menu at least twice a week.Sending fish into space is not new. The first “aquastronauts” to make the journey were tiny fish known as mummichogs (Fundulusheteroclitus) sent into orbit on one of the Apollo missions in 1973. Until then, these small, unremarkable creatures had rarely ventured far from brackish creeks and coastal waters or salt marshes.Dr Cyrille Przybyla.Photograph: Cyrille Przybyla/lfremerThree years later, two Soyuz astronauts carried out a series of experiments withan aquarium of guppiesin the Salyut Soviet space laboratory.In 2015,zebrafish were sent to the ISSto investigate how muscles atrophy in microgravity, while in April last year the Chinese sent several zebrafish to its Tiangong space station. Other missions have transported oyster toadfish, swordtails, medakas, guppies and goldfish.But this is the first time they could actually be farmed and used as a regular food source for astronauts.Przybyla says Lunar Hatch’s ultimate aim is to create a “closed-loop food chain” on the moon, using a series of compartments. The first tanks will be filled with water from ice found at the bottom of craters at the moon’s poles. The wastewater produced by fish in these tanks will be used to produce micro-algae that can then be used to feed filtering organisms, including bivalves, or zooplankton would collect some of the waste.The faeces from the sea bass in the first tank would, meanwhile, be treated by shrimps and worms that would in turn be food for the fish.“The aim of Lunar Hatch is to have no waste,” Przybyla says. “Everything is recycled through an aquaculture system that would have to be autonomous for four to five months.”The team has calculated that to provide two portions of fish each week for seven astronauts on a mission lasting 16 weeks, about 200 sea bass would be needed. As well as the 200 fertilised sea bass eggs sent into space, another 200 siblings produced by the fish at Palavas-les-Flots will be kept as a control group.The path from slightly eccentric idea to the stage of development Przybyla’s project has reached today has taken almost a decade. In 2016, the European Space Agency asked the scientific community for ideas for their future lunar base called the Moon Village. They liked Przybyla’s proposal and, at the end of 2018, he received his first funding from the Centre national d’études spatiales (CNES) the French national space agency.A diagram showing the closed loop food chainThe initial step was to establish whether the fertilised fish eggs could withstand being shaken about during a space launch; the nearby University of Montpellier’s Space Centre agreed to simulate the propulsion of a Russian Soyuz rocket on its equipment used to test satellite prototypes.“Soyuz makes the most vibrations at lift-off compared with other launchers. We used two species and embryos at two different stages and we saw the vibrations didn’t affect their development,” Przybyla says.“Then we looked at what else could disturb the fish cells on their journey, including hypergravity induced by acceleration and cosmic radiation and whether they would continue to form or whether their DNA and development would be affected.”The rice of the sea: how a tiny grain could change the way humanity eatsRead moreSo far the results obtained at Palavas-les-Flots are positive. Now, they need to be put into practice.“We’ve done all the possible simulations we can do on the ground so the goal now is to have a space mission to verify that data and so we can examine the difference between a control group of fish siblings that remain on the Earth,” he says.He and his juvenile sea bass must wait until CNES and Nasa’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida find him a place on a mission, to test his theories.“Unfortunately, we can’t say when that will be but we hope it will be in the near future.”Since announcing the Lunar Hatch programme, the Chinese have revealed they too are carrying out research into closed circuit aquaculture systems that could be used on their space station – so the race is on.View image in fullscreenSea bass eggs at 70 and 73 hours of development. The fish will travel to the moon at embryo stage, with hatching scheduled to taker place upon arrival.Photograph: D Dutto/lfremerFor those who are more concerned about life on Earth, Przybyla says the Lunar Hatch programme has an equally vital application here.“What we have done is converted a system we have been working on for the Earth to the moon,” he says. “On Earth, this recycled circular loop aquaculture is important not only for preservation of the environment but also for economic durability. The same principle that applies for the moon could be used to feed isolated communities.”Explore more on these topicsFishSeascape: the state of our oceansSpaceFoodFrancefeaturesShareReuse this content"

The people whose remarkable stories we gathered have plenty to say.”The play features the reflections of a steelworker, Ian Lewis, whose garage the artist chose for his work; a security guard, Kevin Gregory, who had the tough task of protecting it; and the Essex art dealer John Brandler, who bought the mural. “It’s been an extraordinary process, generating a script full of anger, but also incredible resilience and laugh-out-loud humour,” said Jenkins.The Banksy appeared, as if by witchcraft, in the Taibach area of the town, close to the Tata steelworks (and thechildhood home of Richard Burton). From one angle it showed a child apparently trying to catch snowflakes on their tongue. From another it became clear that what is falling on the child is ash.Tens of thousands of people visited and round-the-clock security was introduced to protect the artwork. It also created a cottage industry in souvenirs – mugs, coasters, keyrings – carrying images of the work.Brandler, bought the piece from Lewis and in May 2019 the Banksy, all 4.5 tonnes of it,was moved to a temporary exhibition spacein the town. No permanent spot in the area could be found and on a bitterly cold February 2022 the piecewas taken away on the back of a lorry.Season’s Greetings is being exhibited alongside other works, by Banksy and Andy Warhol, in Rome. It is possible it could be heading to India and China to be shown there.View image in fullscreenPaul Reynolds and Rob Parsons campaigned t keep the Banksy mural in the town.Photograph: Kara Thomas/Athena Pictures/The GuardianBrandler said he was “angry and frustrated” that Neath Port Talbot council had not found a way of keeping the Banksy but said he was pleased the play would tell the story. The council is unapologetic, saying it would have been too expensive to install it in a new venue and cover insurance and loan fees.But good came out of it. The Banksy may be gone but it has led to a street-art boom in Port Talbot.Bev Simmonds Owen, one of the leaders of a street-art trail in Port Talbot, said: “Since the Banksy appeared we have had over 150 new pieces of street art in the local area. We created careers for at least four local street/mural artists. We have had artists go into local school and teach street art.”Simmonds Owen said the biggest achievement had been the Bridge Street gallery, an open air space that attracts street artists from across the UK. “It changes monthly and there is a huge variety of art styles often of different topical issues or themes and it costs the local tax payers nothing. There is no entry fee, making art accessible for everyone in our community.”Simmonds Owen pointed out that the Hollywood stars Richard Burton, Anthony Hopkins and Michael Sheen had strong Port Talbot links. “I think that the Banksy was a huge instigator for the community to find a new pride in our history as an important and historical place for the arts.”View image in fullscreenThe Banksy mural has led to a street art explosion across Port Talbot.Photograph: Kara Thomas/Athena Pictures/The GuardianThere is a fresh piece of art on the Banksy garage, a piece by Steve Jenkins highlighting the issue of pollution from cars in the town.He said: “The Banksy lit touchpaper for art in the area. I think it should have stayed in Port Talbot as anywhere else it’s seen totally out of context. It need the stack of the steelworks visible in the distance to make it perfect.”When the fight was on to keep the Banksy in Port Talbot, Paul Reynolds, who owns the motorbike shop Kickstart nearby, displayed posters in his shop windows calling for it to stay. He still keeps them rolled upstairs. “Sad, really. It’s great that we’ve got all this new street art. It gives the place some colour. But the Banksy should still be here.”Port Talbot’s Gotta Banksy will be performed at Shermantheatre in Cardiff from 2-10 May 2025, then at theNew Plaza, Port Talbot; Swansea Grandtheatre; Torchtheatre, Milford Haven andTŷ Pawb, Wrexham.Explore more on these topicsWalesTheatreBanksynewsShareReuse this content"

And I do feel hot.’ Photograph: Ben RitterThe actor has seen the best and worst of Hollywood, from directors like Paul Thomas Anderson to the notorious Harvey Weinstein. She talks about her #MeToo moment, her difficult childhood and her new movie, Chosen FamilyByEmine SanerMon 28 Apr 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 28 Apr 2025 06.10 EDTShareFor almost all her life, Heather Graham says, she was a “people pleaser”. It was encouraged in childhood, she says, this obligation to put others’ needs above her own, and it endured even after the 1997 film Boogie Nights had made her a star and she had severed all contact with her “judgmental, authoritarian” parents.Now 55, Graham was in her 40s before she recognised her self-sabotaging tendencies, and tried to correct course. “I realised, no, actually I can just ask myself, ‘What do I want?’ and make myself happy,” she says over Zoom from her home in Los Angeles. “I wish I could have had this when I was 20 or 15. If I wasn’t trying to please other people, what would I have done?” It affected her romantic life and sometimes her work. “There were moments where I feel like I could have stood up for myself more,” she says.That revelation helped inspire her new movie, Chosen Family, which she wrote and directed. It is, she says, essentially about what happens when a people pleaser says no. “I wanted to take some things in my life that I had found hard and painful and turn it into comedy.”View image in fullscreenGraham with James Le Gros, Kelly Lynch and Matt Dillon in the 1989 film Drugstore Cowboy.Photograph: TCD/Prod.DB/AlamyGraham plays Ann, a child-free yoga teacher struggling with her manipulative, dysfunctional family, who embarks on a relationship with a divorced father. There are obvious parallels with her creator – Graham is a yoga fan, has a dysfunctional family (at least in her view), and has been in relationships with men who have children. Was it cathartic to write? “It was, because I think having a sense of humour about yourself and your life, it helps to not take things too seriously.”In the film, Ann’s family, especially her religious father, are disapproving of her relationships and expect her to look after her younger sister Clio (played by Julia Stiles), who has a drug addiction. Graham hasn’t spoken to her own family for about 30 years. “I think I felt, as a younger person, that I couldn’t really set boundaries with them that they would respect, so I wanted to explore that in the movie.”Chosen Family review – fluid directing by Heather Graham ballasts enjoyable romcomRead moreOther emotions also get an airing. Ann seems sad that she never had children, though Graham has always seemed like a great advert for the happily child-free woman. “I think I’ve had moments where I wondered: what would it have been like if I had a kid? I guess I would say 80% of the time I feel glad I don’t have kids, and I feel free and really good about it, and maybe 20% of the time I wonder what would it be like. You just have to appreciate the life you have.”She admires women who buck society’s expectations. “I do think it’s awesome now that more women are expressing their desire to not have kids.” Again, she says, it is almost people pleasing on a big scale. “The culture says: ‘You need to have kids.’ But why? If you’re not being a people pleaser, what do you really want?”It took Graham a long time to work out what she wanted. Her father worked for the FBI and her mother was a teacher who became a poet and writer of children’s books; Graham’s younger sister is also now an actor and director. The family lived in Agoura Hills, in the Santa Monica mountains north of Los Angeles, and Graham says she was shy and nerdy, but could come out of herself when dressing up and in school plays. As a teenager, she would go to auditions in LA for popular teenage girl roles, “like a beautiful cheerleader – and I was not a cheerleader. I felt like I was acting out my fantasy: I wish I was the girl at school that the boys liked.” She got work quickly – at 17, she was in her first big film role, the 1988 teen comedy License to Drive.At about the same time, she was offered a role in the black comedy Heathers. “My parents vetoed it.” Graham moved out, and it was the beginning of the end of her relationship with them. “I kind of became my own person and discovered: ‘What do I like? What do I want when I’m not under this very judgmental, authoritarian, parental, patriarchal structure? What do I want to do? What do I think of this?’”View image in fullscreenIn Chosen Family.Photograph: Everett/ShutterstockIn her mid-20s, Graham decided to cut contact with her parents and sister. By then, her career had taken off, with roles in Drugstore Cowboy and Six Degrees of Separation, and as a recurring character in Twin Peaks. “My father’s really religious, and they were, especially my father, very critical of everything I was doing.” To her parents, she says, Hollywood seemed like a pit of sin, and they didn’t approve of the roles – usually the sexy love interest – that Graham was getting. “It didn’t feel like a healthy dynamic. I stopped talking to them and, I have to say, that was a huge relief. I felt like, at that moment, my life opened up with a freedom. I didn’t need to please them.”As a child, she says: “I feel like I wasn’t brought up to have a deep sense of self-esteem, and I think as I detached from my family, I built my own sense of self-esteem. Sort of like a detective, I went through my past and looked at how I developed certain ways of thinking that weren’t the healthiest, and basically just went on a journey to be happier.”Over the years, did they try to contact her? “There was an effort made, but it was always very judgmental like: ‘Let me give you the number of the priest and you can go to confession.’ I just think we’re really different. They have a lot of great qualities – it’s just not a healthy dynamic for me.”By the early 2000s, when Graham was in her early 30s, she had built a successful career, including an acclaimed role as Rollergirl, a pornographic actor in Boogie Nights, as the girlfriend of the main character in Swingers and as sexy CIA agent Felicity Shagwell in the Austin Powers sequel. Did she feel objectified? “On one hand, it was fun, because I grew up feeling nerdy and like I wasn’t the attractive girl at school. I felt flattered; I felt like I was playing a character, like I was pretending to be this attractive actress. Underneath it all, I really felt like this nerdy girl.”View image in fullscreenWith Mike Myers in 1999’s Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me.Photograph: FlixPix/AlamyBut she also found it frustrating to be continually cast as the love interest. “I related to the awkward romantic comedy heroines more than to the glam characters. Sometimes, I felt like I wasn’t being seen for my intelligence or other qualities.”Around that time, the film producerHarvey Weinsteininvited Graham to his office, and, showing her a pile of scripts, essentially offered her the chance to pick a film to star in. “And then he said something like: ‘My wife and I have an arrangement, and when I’m out of town, I can do whatever I want.’” The implication was clear, and then he tried to hug her.Graham tried to manage it. “In that moment, I wasn’t like: ‘Fuck off.’ I just felt like, oh my God, I don’t know how to handle this situation. How do I get out of this without completely alienating him?”Some time later, Weinstein invited her to dinner and Graham asked a friend, another actor, to come. Her friend cancelled at the last minute. Weinstein, Graham says, called and asked her to meet him in his hotel room instead, claiming that her friend was already there (an obvious lie, Graham having just spoken to her). “I was like, I can’t do this. And then he never worked with me again.”There were other instances, with other men. “There were moments where I do feel like I was being hit on, and moments where I thought people were being inappropriate. It was not happening in every job and, at some moments, I would have more power, like if my career was going really well. I would say most people were not like that. But there’s definitely some creepy people there.”View image in fullscreenAs Rollergirl in the 1997 film Boogie Nights.Photograph: United Archives GmbH/AlamyShe watched the #MeToo movement unfold with a sense of justice restored, and wrote about her own experience with Weinstein (who is now being retried in New Yorkfor rape – which he denies – after his 2020 conviction was overturned). “It felt so exciting to see this powerful guy not get away with it,” says Graham. “Because, from my whole career, people would be like: ‘Just don’t put yourself in that situation, otherwise it’s your fault.’ There was victim shaming, like: ‘You shouldn’t have gone to his hotel room.’”If the situation has improved for women in the entertainment industry in terms of sexual harassment, there is still a way to go in terms of equality. It was a struggle for Graham to get her latest film made. “Most movies are financed based on a male actor attaching themselves,” she says with a smile, “and if it’s not a male-driven story – if the guy’s not this hero, like killing all these people and saving everyone’s lives – it’s sometimes harder to get men to attach. Every independent movie is like: ‘Get the most famous actor you can for no money. And I hope it’s a man.’ If it’s a woman, you need two.” She gives a frustrated laugh.Getting Stiles on board as Ann’s sister, “along with me being in it, got the movie greenlit, so I’m very grateful to her for supporting me and believing in me”.Graham has worked with so many great male directors: Gus Van Sant, Paul Thomas Anderson, David Lynch. Did she ever wonder where the women were? “It’s awesome to work with great male directors,” she says. “But most stories are told from a male point of view so, as a woman, you usually end up being some kind of supporting character. Women’s stories weren’t being told with the same kind of excitement and money and support, and that made me think, well, this affects how women grow up, and how women think about themselves … I think it’s so important that there’s more and more female film-makers now.”She tries to be positive, she says (perhaps thanks to three decades of transcendental meditation, to which Lynch introduced her). “I try not to latch on to defeatist ways of thinking, and believe that the system is always changing.” She feels the same about the state of US politics. “I think it’s really stressful,” she says. “Of course, I’d love to see a woman president. I hope we survive it. I try to just detach from drama and focus on what’s good.”View image in fullscreenWith John Brotherton and Ella Grace Helton in Chosen Family.Photograph: Everett/ShutterstockWhat about roles for older women in notoriously youth-obsessed Hollywood? Recently, she says, she was cast in two parts that were originally written for women in their 30s. “I think there’s a beauty that a woman can have as she gets older that’s like a powerful, sexy beauty. Like, how do you still feel good and sexy about yourself at any age, and just embrace that? Because it really doesn’t matter what other people think – it’s how you feel about yourself. If you feel that you’re hot, you feel hot. And I do feel hot.” She laughs again.Neither Graham nor her Chosen Family character, Ann, are averse to putting bikini photos up on Instagram. I wonder if that’s about seeking validation from others (she looks incredible), but Graham says that’s the wrong way to look at it. “I think I’m just enjoying my sexuality as a woman.”Recovering from being a people pleaser has clearly brought her more contentment. “Before, I was more: ‘What do other people think?’ Now I’m just like, fuck it.”Chosen Family is on digital platformsExplore more on these topicsThe G2 interviewHarvey WeinsteininterviewsShareReuse this content"

Amnesty noted a climate of scapegoating migrants under Trump.Photograph: GettySacha Deshmukh,Amnesty InternationalUK’s chief executive, described the US president’s swift and deliberate targeting of international institutions designed to make the world safer and fairer as “terrifying”.“You look forward to the end of this decade and wonder whether the basic frameworks and underpinnings of not just human rights but international law will still be standing. You probably haven’t been able to say that since 1935,” he said.Amnesty’s report also documents how mass arbitrary arrests, enforced disappearances and lethal force are becoming increasingly widespread tools of repression.InBangladesh, “shoot-on-sight”orders duringstudent protestsled to hundreds of deaths;Mozambique’s disputed electionssimilarly sparked a deadly crackdown; and Turkey also imposeddraconian bans on demonstrations.The report also identified global inaction as an area of concern, particularly in relation toSudan’s ruinous civil war.

Most poor countries have cheap loans from the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, which give new “concessional” loans instead of writing down old ones.The UK bill, introduced in November 2024 by the Labour MP Bambos Charalambous, would “prevent private creditors suing countries while debt relief negotiations are taking place, and from seeking higher repayments than other creditors”, said a letter sent to the British chancellor, Rachel Reeves, in March and shared exclusively with the Guardian.The average developing country is spending 9.5% of government revenues repaying debt, double the level of a decade ago. The poorest countries are spending 15%,according to the UN development programme. From 2012 to 2022, public spending on debt grewfaster than on health and education.The letter said “90% of debt owed to private creditors by the world’s poorest countries is governed by English law and is transacted through the City of London. This is why any relief from undue profit to private lenders relies on your government.”Signatories included high commissioners to the UK from Zambia, Mozambique and South Africa, which has made tackling the “unprecedented debt crisis among many African countries” a priority of its G20 presidency this year.Charalambous said he hoped the government would adopt the bill and that he had met the Treasury minister Emma Reynolds. A UK government spokesperson said: “The UK fully agrees that private creditors should participate in restructurings on comparable terms. Overall, we have seen evidence of private creditors’ willingness to engage and provide debt treatments where needed, including for Zambia and Ghana.“As such, the UK is not currently pursuing a legislative approach to ensuring private creditor participation in restructurings, although we continue to keep our position under review.”After the Covid pandemic hit, lending countries agreed to pause debt repayments. However, western private creditors refused, an issue that aggrieved China.Zambia stopped repaying its international debts in November 2020. Along with Ethiopia and Chad it sought to restructure its loans in early 2021 under a new G20 process called the common framework. However, the process was fraught with delays.It took 17 months for Chad to reach adeal that did not cut debt levels, after the commodities trader Glencore dragged out negotiations.Chinese intransigence reportedlyheld up Zambia’s agreement with lending countries until 2023. Those countries thenrejected a dealthe Zambia government reached with western bondholders, as they said it was better than their deal. A bonds agreement was finally reachedin 2024.Some officials and analysts argued the UK bill was targeting a prior problem of western “vulture funds” buying up poor countries’ defaulted bonds to sue them for payouts. They said recent restructurings had been delayed by the proliferation of new types of lenders, including Chinese state-owned institutions and African multilateral trade banks.Abebe Aemro Selassie, the IMF’s Africa director, told a press conference last week that he was not sure new legislation would speed up debt restructurings: “In recent restructurings, I am not aware of [private creditors holding out] being the main hindrance.”Since 2014, the inclusion of “collective action clauses” – where the owners of 75% of a country’s bonds can approve a restructuring deal – in 88% of bonds has stopped most “vulture fund” minority bondholders from suing countries,the thinktank ODI said in a report.However, Ethiopia’s negotiations to cut the value of its single bond have reportedly beendelayed by a bondholder group.In Zambia, Malawi and Ghana, the African Export-Import Bank (Afreximbank) and Trade & Development Bank (TDB) have not agreed to loan writedowns. Both are regional trade banks set up by African governments that lend at high interest rates but havedemanded to be excluded from restructuringslike the IMF and World Bank.Spokespeople for Afreximbank and TDB did not respond to requests for comment.“Non-bond private creditors … are very different … and it is unlikely that the solutions provided in the [UK] bill would apply easily to them,” said Frederique Dahan, a director at ODI.Malawi, which has a GDP per headof $580, has been trying to get debt writedowns while being battered by climate and economic shocks that have led to fuel, fertiliser and medicine shortages.Thomas Bisika, Malawi’s high commissioner to the UK and who signed the letter supporting Charalambous’s bill, said: “This unsustainable debt has really grossly affected social and economic development in the country.”Explore more on these topicsAfricaDebt reliefEconomic policyGlobal economyEconomicsnewsShareReuse this content"

As the driver sped away, they slowed down in the 42C heat, smiled regretfully, and waited for the next heavy duty vehicle to pass.At the peak of Boko Haram’s 15-year insurgency, bombs went off with frightening regularity at the popular Monday market. But the city –known as the birthplace of Boko Haram– has not suffered a major attack since February 2021, and the low-key security atmosphere reflected its relative tranquility.The group was founded in 2002, but its campaign of terror took off in 2009, after the killing of its founder, Mohammed Yusuf, by police in July of that year. More than 36,000 people were killed and 2.2 million others displaced. In one particularly notorious incident 11 years ago this month, Boko Haram kidnapped 276 girls from a school in the town of Chibok.Many outside the region assumed the insurgency had been extinguished, but on 8 April this year Borno’s governor, Babagana Zulum, issued a troubling warning: Boko Haram was staging a comeback. Zulum told a meeting of security agents that renewed attacks and kidnappings were occurring “almost on a daily basis without confrontation”, in a sign that the state’s authorities were “losing ground”.View image in fullscreenBabagana Zulum, the governor of Borno, left, believes that Boko Haram is resurgent.Photograph: AP Photo/APZulum made the warning less than a month after gunmen raided two military bases in Borno and his security convoyreportedly intercepteda Boko Haram ambush attempt. The number of fatalities in both cases remains unclear.In response to Zulum, a spokesperson for the military authorities said: “The military is sacrificing a lot, and our efforts should be appreciated.”Nigeria’s information minister, Mohammed Idris, also said the armed groups have been “largely dissipated”, toeing the tone of his predecessor Lai Mohammed, who in 2015 said they had been “technically defeated”.“We’re not saying that we have 100% exterminated Boko Haram,” Idris said after the security meeting. “But I think that we’ve degraded Boko Haram significantly for them to pose any kind of significant challenge for us as a country.”Zulum fired back: “I believe he is naive about what is happening in the country.”In recent years, a multinational coalition between Cameroon, Chad, Niger and Nigeria has reclaimed territory controlled by Boko Haram and helped to secure garrison towns from attacks. The group has simultaneously been weakened by a split into two factions that often fight among themselves.In January 2024, Bola Tinubu, Nigeria’s president, promised to “stamp out the remaining vestiges of Boko Haram, Ansaru, banditry and kidnapping gangs”.View image in fullscreenAid workers speak to people who have been displaced at the Muna settlement.Photograph: Eromo Egbejule/The Guardian“We won’t rest until every agent of darkness is completely rooted out,” he added.However, analysts have said troops are struggling to contain jihadists in the “Timbuktu Triangle” – a term referencing the Malian city, a former jihadist stronghold – and used to denote an area stretching from eastern Yobe state into western Borno.Beyond the attacks on army bases,local reportssaid 40 farmers were reportedly killed and several others kidnapped by Boko Haram and Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP) in January. The latter faction split to ally with Islamic State and has taken on a different style, taxing some villages and small towns that they control and remitting taxes to commanders.There are also fears that thousands of displaced households sent from camps back to their villages under a resettlement scheme may now be under threat.As long as ago as 2023 the International Crisis Group warned of the resettlement scheme: “The hasty process is endangering displaced people’s lives – putting them closer to the fighting and cutting them off from support. By exposing civilians to hardship, the government risks giving jihadist groups an opportunity to forge ties with relocated communities and draw benefits from their economic activities.”The situation in Yobe is tense. In September34 peoplewere killed in an attack, then in Marcha pro-Tinubu media outletreported that villagers in Gujba, where more than 40 studentswere massacred in 2013, had been given eviction notices by Boko Haram for helping the army defeat the jihadists in a recent battle. The authorities claimed there was “no credible intelligence” backing the report.In late March,Niger withdrew from the military coalition, prompting concerns about intelligence sharing and the capacity to keep jihadists at bay after the exit of French and American troopsfrom the Sahel. A new and much bigger regional force, established this year, is yet to get on its feet.In Maiduguri, some say the Tinubu administration has been complacent and accuse thenational security adviserof being more focused on political matters.In a clinic in the city, an aid worker who wanted to remain anonymous watched student nurses roam the hallways. “Everybody has forgotten Maiduguri,” they said.Explore more on these topicsBoko HaramNigeriaAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

They didn’t have an opportunity to talk this through, to weigh the pros and cons of taking or leaving their children in the US,” Willis said.One of the mothers, who was deported with her seven-year-old and her four-year-old, both of whom are citizens, was unable to access medications and care for her youngest, who has a rare form of late-stage cancer.Another woman, who is pregnant, was put on a plane to Honduras along with her 11-year-old and two-year-old daughters, even as the children’s father and a caretaker designated by the family were desperately trying to contact them.“She’s in the early stages of a pregnancy and has undergone unimaginable stress,” said Willis. “So she’s trying to ensure her and that unborn child’s safety and health, while also processing and working through what they’ve all been through.”Both families were detained at regular check-in appointments with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) in New Orleans, according to lawyers, and then taken hours away from the city and prohibited from communicating with family members.Each year, hundreds of thousands of immigrant parents in similar situations, who have both a deportation order and US citizen children, have to choose whether to leave their kids in the US under the care of another family member or guardian, or surrender them to Child Protective Services.“No parent would want to be in that situation,” Willis said. “And we don’t bring any judgment against any decision that a parent makes.”But the mothers who were rushed on to deportation flights with their children last week, in high-profile cases that have drawn widespread condemnation from civil rights groups and lawmakers, were not empowered to make any real choices for their families, Willis said.“There were no real decisions being made here, especially when those parents were not able to communicate with other available caregivers,” she added.After lawyers for VML, the two-year-old who is identified in court documents by only her initials, filed an emergency motion to prevent the US citizen toddler’s deportation, a federal district judge raised concerns that he had a “strong suspicion that the government just deported a US citizen with no meaningful process”.A hearing in VML’s case has been scheduled for 18 May. Meanwhile, theTrump administrationhas been claiming that the family’s cases were handled legally and with due process.Trump’s border czar,Tom Homan, said: “The children aren’t deported. The mother chose to take the children with her.”In an interview with NBC’s Meet the Press, the secretary of state,Marco Rubio, echoed Homan, saying: “I imagine those three US citizen children have fathers here in the United States. They can stay with their father. That’s up to their family to decide where the children go.”The Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to the Guardian’s request for comment.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The father, who had brought them to the check-in appointment, began to worry that the appointment was taking longer than usual – and was later told that his partner and daughters had been detained.When he was eventually able to speak to them, he could hear his partner and daughter crying on the phone and his call was cut off before he was able to give them a number for the family’s attorneys.The government told him that it had removal orders for VML’s mother and her 11-year-old sister, who was not born in the US, and that their mother was choosing to also take VML to Honduras with them. They pointed to a handwritten letter, which they say was written by the mother, that reads in Spanish: “I will take my daughter ... with me to Honduras.”But the family’s lawyers dispute that the letter proves their consent, especially given that the parents weren’t allowed to coordinate VML’s release. They had wanted the toddler to be handed over to a US citizen that the family had chosen to serve as VML’s legal custodian. “The mom was never asked what she wanted. She was told, your child will be deported with you,” Willis said.Before their deportation, both families had been dutifully complying with Ice ordersto regularly check-in.VML’s mother had arrived at the US southern border during the “remain in Mexico” program instituted during the first Trump administration, which forced non-Mexican asylum seekers to wait south of the border while their cases were processed.The mother, and her now 11-year-old, had reported to an initial appointment with immigration officials but had been kidnapped in Mexico – and were unable to attend their second immigration hearing. When the mother and daughter managed to return and seek safety in the United States, immigration officials released them into the country on the condition that they regularly check-in – which they had been doing for about four years, according to Willis.The other woman deported with her children had entered the US as an unaccompanied minor child, and had been issued deportation orders after she failed to report at a hearing that she was not aware was happening, as she never received a summons, Willis said.Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationHondurasTrump administrationMarco RubioLaw (US)US politicsAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

And I say the only way this thing really works is for Canada to become a state,” he told Time magazine on Friday.On election day itself, Trump resumed his provocations with a social media post suggesting he was on the ballot and repeating that Canada should become the 51st state, incorrectly claiming that the US subsidizes Canada. “It makes no sense unless Canada is a State!” Trump posted.The Conservative leader, Pierre Poilievre, responded to Trump with a post of his own.“President Trump, stay out of our election. The only people who will decide the future of Canada are Canadians at the ballot box,” Poilievre posted. “Canada will always be proud, sovereign and independent and we will NEVER be the 51st state.”As recently as January, Poilievre was poised for the largest and most resounding electoral victory in more than half a century.Canadianpollsters and political pundits struggled to find fresh ways to describe the bleak prospects for the then prime ministerJustin Trudeau’s Liberal party, which seemed on track for a catastrophic blowout. The party trailed the Conservatives by as many as 27 points in some polls.Canada election is Carney’s to lose in contest turned on its head by TrumpRead moreBut Trump’s detonation of the US’s closest diplomatic and economic relationship has fundamentally reshaped how many feel about their southern neighbour and heavily influenced how Mark Carney, the former central banker who inherited control of the Liberal party to become prime minister in mid-March, has shaped his electoral bid.That framing has the possibility of producing a result that would have been unfathomable three months ago.Now the Conservatives’ chances of an electoral victory are slim – and would require a significant polling miss and a groundswell of support in key battlegrounds.“Almost everything about this campaign is without precedent. For the first time in Canada’s history, our closest geographic, economic and security partner has placed us in the crosshairs, disrupting our sense of economic and physical security,” said Scott Reid, a political adviser and former director of communications to the Liberal former prime minister Paul Martin.“And then you have this unprecedented situation where Mark Carney, with no electoral experience emerges on to the scene, reverses a 26-point deficit in his party’s fortunes and takes them to the brink of a majority victory. [There’s’] nothing about this that’s happened before. It’s not just that it’s unprecedented, it’s that it’s enormously consequential in all of its implications. It’s all jaw-dropping.”Still, the prospect of a fourth consecutive Liberal term has frustrated many in the country, who see a government that was unable to rein in a cost of living crisis on the verge of retaining power.“Ten years of a Liberal government is a long time. They had their shot. And the changes they made are for the worst. We need a new government, we need new ideas, new people and new ministers,” said Sam, who lives in a new housing development in Carney’s electoral district in Ottawa.He said that although Carney cast himself as a novice, the Liberal leader was a “political insider”, adding: “I’m not saying he’s not a qualified person. But he’s also a businessman. So is Trump. Look how that’s turned out for everyone.”Running on a message of change, Poilievre, a seven-term parliamentarian, has attracted thousands to his energetic rallies across Canada, and won over young voters attracted by his response to the country’s cost of living crisis.“Canadians are asking the simple question: can we really afford to allow Mark Carney to have the fourth term of Justin Trudeau, raising exactly the same taxes, running exactly the same deficits, doubling exactly the same housing costs, with exactly the same Liberal team?” Poilievre said during a campaign stop in the city of Saskatoon, a Tory stronghold.“There’s a generational divide in the country and real questions of whether the Canadian dream is achievable any more. Poilievre was beating the drums about this and Trudeau’s popularity was plummeting. And exactly the wrong moment, we have this threat to the south of us and it completely overturned the tables in Canadian politics,” said Melanie Paradis, the president of Texture Communications and director of communications for the former Conservative leader Erin O’Toole.“And the question is, what’s at stake? For the older generation, it’s the sovereignty and integrity of Canada. The existential threat to their future is Trump [but] the existential threat to the future of the younger generation is being able to own a home and start a family.”That shift in political calculus puts the Conservatives in a difficult place.“We’ve had a bizarre reversal of fortunes. We used to be so reliably strong with the older demographic – people who you could really count on to show up and vote on election day,” said Paradis. “Now we have an incredibly strong showing among young voters, but now we’ve lost the support of senior men.”A race dominated by the two main party’s leaders is also poised to devastate smaller opposition parties, all of which have struggled to be part of a discussion focused on Canada’s economic and political responses to Trump. The New Democratic party, which previously propped up Trudeau’s minority government, is poised for its biggest-ever loss, and its leader, Jagmeet Singh, is at risk of losing his federal seat in the Burnaby South electoral district.“Conservative attacks on the [NDP’s support for the Liberals] were highly effective in eroding trust in Jagmeet Singh. But the result was, when you see this threat from Trump, people who would have normally voted for the party are now strategically looking at the Liberals,” said Paradis.The Green leader, Elizabeth May, is also at risk of losing her seat. A wave of patriotic sentiment, spurred by Trump, hasthreatened the electoral prospectsof the separatist Bloc Québécois to the benefit of the Liberals.Already, more than 7 million people have cast ballots in early voting – a 25% increase over the previous record, helped in large part by the Easter long weekend. The first polls close at 8.30pm Atlantic time, with seat-rich Québec and Ontario closing at 9.30pm eastern time, with results expected soon after.Looming over the final day of electioneering was adeadly attack at a bustling street festival in Vancouverthat left the country reeling and forced Carney to briefly suspend his campaign in order to make sombre remarks to the nation.“Those families are living every family’s nightmare,” Carney said on Sunday morning, after a driver killed at least 11 people and injured more at the Filipino community’s Lapu Lapu festival. “I know that I join all Canadians in mourning with you. I know that Canadians are united with you.”A visibly emotional Carney spoke of “Bayanihan”, the Filipino value of community serving those in need.“This spirit upon which we must draw in this incredibly difficult time. We will comfort the grieving. We will care for each other. We will unite in common purpose,” he added.Explore more on these topicsCanadaAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Voters will choose the 41 members of the lower House of Representatives for a five-year term.The trigger for the vote was former prime minister Keith Rowley’s unprecedented decision to stand down in March, becoming the country’s first leader to resign without losing at the polls.Stuart Young, 50, was sworn in as prime minister, and a day later, he dissolved parliament and called the election, seeking a public mandate for his leadership.Opposing him is Kamla Persad-Bissessar, the 73-year-old leader of the UNC, who was prime minister from 2010 to 2015. Her party has endured internal upheaval, high-profile resignations, and a string of electoral defeats, but she retains a loyal base, campaigning against the government’s record on crime and the rising cost of living.The elections come on the heels of a three-month state of emergency, declared on 30 December after awave of bloody gang warfare. Last year, T&T, which has a population ofabout 1.5 million, recorded 624 homicides, making it one of themost violent countriesin Latin America and the Caribbean.“Crime will be a major factor in the election because the government has been unable to take control of the situation,” Hamid Ghany, a University of the West Indies political analyst, said.The UNC has promised a range of initiatives to tackle crime, including the creation of new ministries of defence and justice. The PNM, meanwhile, has promised to modernise governance, digitise services and improve public safety through the creation of a ministry of implementation and efficiency.View image in fullscreenKamla Persad-Bissessar shows her stained finger after casting her ballot at a polling station in Hermitage Village, Trinidad and Tobago, on 7 September 2015.Photograph: Andrea De Silva/ReutersAn opinion pollcommissioned by the T&T Guardian and conducted between 10 and 13 April by Ghany shows the UNC leading the PNM in most of Trinidad’s swing seats, while PNM retains an edge in Tobago. Among 1,650 respondents across 11 marginal constituencies in Trinidad, 45% said they would vote for the UNC if elections were held tomorrow, compared with 30% for the PNM.The survey also revealed that 61% of Trinidadian respondents were dissatisfied with the PNM’s performance over the last decade. Young insists that the PNM’s internal tracking shows a lead in several key constituencies.Ghany described the election as a contest between the “working class and the privileged class”. For people like maintenance worker Clinton Brewster, 35, the gravest concern is the rising cost of living, which is outpacing salaries.“The trade unions have sided with the UNC against the government on the need to address the concerns of the working class in attempting to repair the post-Covid economy. Class concerns have cut across race and ethnic lines, which has diminished the race factor in this election,” Ghany said.Race has historically been a fault line in local politics, with the PNM drawing support from Afro-Trinidadians and the UNC from Indo-Trinidadian communities. While both parties have repeatedly denied weaponising ethnicity, the 2025 campaign has included accusations of racial messaging in AI-generated ads and finger-pointing over class representation.A senior member of the T&T Hindu community, Dharmacharya Pandit Rampersad Parasram, said equality and equity are “front-burner” issues. He added that while the country has had to grapple with the impact of a post-colonial legacy, “we got independence 63 years ago. So what was then was then.“We just have to make sure that the gains that we have made in our fight for equality, fair play and justice, that we consolidate those gains and do not compromise them in any way. Words like equality and equity must remain important in a futureTrinidad and Tobago,” he said.Caribbean activists step up fight to end homophobic laws that ‘breach fundamental rights’Read moreBeyond these internal issues, the international context is also important, Ghany said. “This election is important in the Trump era because of the US policy towards Venezuela.”Earlier this month, the US revoked two licenses it had granted in recent years for the development of offshore natural gas projects between Trinidad and Tobago and Venezuela, dealing a blow to the country’s economic growth projections.“The closeness between PM Young and [Venezuela’s] Maduro’s regime will be on the Trump administration’s radar should the PNM win the election,” Ghany said. “It is quite possible that there may be a different response from the Trump administration should the UNC win the election, given the favourable disposition of Kamla Persad-Bissessar towards Trump.”Explore more on these topicsTrinidad and TobagoAmericasTrump tariffsCaribbeannewsShareReuse this content"

Vancouver’s police chief, Steve Rai, described the carnage as “the darkest day” in the city’s history and told reporters it was “impossible to overstate how many lives have been impacted for ever” by the lone driver.View image in fullscreenPeople comfort each other near the scene the day after a man driving an SUV killed 11 people during a Filipino community festival.Photograph: Lindsey Wasson/APSome of the injured were in critical condition. As of Sunday evening authorities had not released the names of those killed, but said they were aged between five and 65.The attack occurred shortly after 8pm on Saturday, when a man drove a black Audi SUV down a street in the city, striking people attending theLapu Lapu Day festival. He was arrested at the scene.Video of the aftermath showed the dead and injured along the narrow street in South Vancouver lined by food trucks. The front of the driver’s SUV was heavily damaged.0:56Vancouver: several people killed after car ploughs into crowd at community event – videoThe Lapu-Lapu festival, held on a warm spring day, drew nearly 100,000 people, many of whom were families with young children. The celebration is named after Datu Lapu-Lapu, an Indigenous resistance fighter in the Philippines, who orchestrated the defeat of the Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan in battle in 1521.Saturday’s festival was the second annual event for the city and organisers advertised a street parade, artisans, cultural activities, a basketball tournament and local food vendors.View image in fullscreenA woman and a child place a tribute to those killed at the Lapu Lapu Day festival. The attack came just two days ahead of a national election.Photograph: Chris Helgren/ReutersCarney, the Liberal party prime minister and former Bank of England governor who is favourite to win Monday’s election, paused campaigning to address the country on Sunday morning.“Those families are living every family’s nightmare,” said a visibly emotional Carney. “I know that I join all Canadians in mourning with you. I know that Canadians are united with you.”Carney referenced “Bayanihan”, the Filipino value of community serving those in need. “This spirit upon which we must draw in this incredibly difficult time. We will comfort the grieving. We will care for each other. We will unite in common purpose.”Kris Pangilinan, who brought his pop-up clothing and lifestyle booth to the festival, saw the vehicle enter past the barricade slowly before the vehicle accelerated in an area that was packed with people after a concert. He said hearing the sounds of bodies hitting the vehicle will never leave him.“And all I can remember is seeing bodies flying up in the air higher than the food trucks themselves and landing on the ground and people yelling and screaming. It looked like a bowling ball hitting bowling pins and all the pins are flying into the air.”Carayn Nulada said that she pulled her granddaughter and grandson off the street and used her body to shield them from the SUV. She said that her daughter suffered a narrow escape.Vancouver attack: what is the Lapu Lapu Day festival?Read more“The car hit her arm and she fell down, but she got up, looking for us, because she is scared,” said Nulada, who described children screaming, and pale-faced victims lying on the ground or wedged under vehicles. “I saw people running and my daughter was shaking.”Festival attenders held the suspect until police could arrive.Video circulating on social media showed a young man in a hoodie with his back against a chain-link fence, alongside a security guard and surrounded by bystanders screaming and swearing at him.Police set up a 24-hour assistance centre to help anyone who had been unable to contact relatives or friends who were at the festival.Carney cancelled his first campaign event and two major rallies on the final day of the election campaign before Monday’s vote, which has been heavily influenced by the spectre of Donald Trump’s threats to annexCanadaand a trade war he has launched against his country’s northern neighbour.Vancouver had more than 38,600 residents of Filipino heritage in 2021, representing 5.9% of the city’s total population, according to Statistics Canada.Associated Press contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsCanadaAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

It was unclear if he had managed to find the device.The incident was a reminder of the dangers Fuji poses to inexperienced climbers who underestimate the challenge of traversing its steep slopes. People are urged not to hike during the off-season as conditions can quickly become treacherous.Mount Fuji, an active volcano thatmost recently erupted in 1707, is covered in snow for most of the year and opens to hikers between early July and early September. Many walk partway up the mountain, while others navigate the rocky terrain through the night to watch the sunrise from the summit.The hiking season attractshuge numbers of foreign tourists, prompting local authorities last year tocap the number of daily visitorson the most popular trail to combat overcrowding.From this summer, hikers on Fuji’s four main trails will be charged a fee of 4,000 yen ($28/£21).Additional reporting by Agence France-PresseExplore more on these topicsJapanVolcanoesMountainsAsia PacificChinanewsShareReuse this content"

We will always honour the Korean heroes who gave their lives forRussiaand for our shared freedom, alongside their brothers-in-arms from the Russian Federation,” Putin said in a statement released by the Kremlin.In a statement released on Monday, North Korea’s KCNA state news agency quoted the ruling party as saying that the end of the battle in Russia’s Kursk region showed the “highest strategic level of the firm militant friendship” betweenNorth Koreaand Russia.The acknowledgment follows months of silence over the deployment, which has been widely reported in western media. The Kremlin also said Russia was ready to provide assistance to North Korea “similar to the support offered to its soldiers in the Kursk region”.From ammunition to ballistic missiles: how North Korea arms Russia in the Ukraine warRead moreRussia claimed last week that Ukrainian forces had been expelled from the last Russian village they had been holding. Kyiv has denied the claim, however, and said Ukrainian troops were also still operating in Belgorod, another Russian region borderingUkraine.Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said on Sunday that Ukraine’s army was still fighting in Kursk despite Moscow claiming the “liberation” of its western region.“Our military continues to perform tasks in the Kursk and Belgorod regions – we are maintaining our presence on Russian territory,” he said in his evening address. In a statement earlier on Sunday, he conceded that the situation remained difficult in many areas, including Kursk.The central military commission of North Korea’s ruling Workers’ party said Kim made the decision to deploy troops under the comprehensive strategic partnership treatyhe signed with Putinin June 2024.“Under the order of the head of state, the sub-units of the armed forces of the Republic regarded the territory of Russia as one of their country and proved the firm alliance between the two countries,” KCNA cited the commission as saying.North Korea “regards it as an honour to have an alliance with such a powerful state as the Russian Federation”, KCNA added.China turning blind eye to its citizens fighting in Ukraine, says ZelenskyyRead moreThe agency quoted Kim as saying: “They who fought for justice are all heroes and representatives of the honour of the motherland.”North Korea sent an estimated total of 14,000 troops, including 3,000 reinforcements, to replace those killed, injured orcaptured, Ukrainian officials have said. With no armoured vehicles or drone warfare experience, theytook heavy casualtiesbut adapted quickly, the officials added.Russia confirmed on Saturday for the first time that North Korean soldiers had been fighting alongside Russians in Kursk. Neither Russia nor North Korea had previously either confirmed or denied the deployment.The US state department said it was concerned by North Korea’s direct involvement in Russia’s war in Ukraine and that Pyongyang’s military deployment must end.“We continue to be concerned by [North Korea’s] direct involvement in the war. [North Korea’s] military deployment to Russia and any support provided by the Russian Federation to [North Korea] in return must end,” a state department spokesperson said in an email, adding that third countries such as North Korea “bear responsibility” for the war.Kim, whose material support for Putin could earn North Korea access to Russian satellite and military technology to boost its nuclear missile programme, said a monument would soon be built in the capital, Pyongyang, to honour his soldiers’ “battle feats”.North Korea has also provided Russia withvast quantities of ammunition, artillery shells, ballistic missiles and other weapons. South Korea, the US and their partners worry that Russia could reward North Korea by transferring hi-tech weapons technologies for use in its nuclear weapons programme. North Korea is also expected to receive economic and other assistance from Russia.Kim’s reference to “the tombstones of the fallen soldiers” is seen as public confirmation by the regime that North Korean troops had been killed in combat.Zelenskyy has put the number of killed or wounded North Koreans at 4,000, though US estimates are lower, about 1,200.Kim said North Korea must “take important national measures to specially honour and care for the families of war veterans”.Experts said Moscow and Pyongyang were likely to have agreed in advance to publicly disclose the deployment.“The two countries agreed to disclose the deployment because they judged that the benefits of compensation for the troop deployment outweighed the potential damage to their international image,” Yang Moo-jin, president of the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul, told Agence France-Presse.By promising state benefits to the deployed troops, North Korea could also “sufficiently ease internal backlash”, Yang said, adding that the move reflected Pyongyang’s growing confidence.“North Korea likely aimed to showcase that victory was achieved thanks to their involvement, thereby securing greater rewards from Russia,” he added.Explore more on these topicsNorth KoreaRussiaUkraineAsia PacificEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The group also “cleaned up leftover plastic bottles, wooden sticks and other debris and garbage on the reef”, the broadcaster reported.Philippines Coast Guard spokesperson Jay Tarrielasaidon Sunday that its navy, coast guard and police personnel had deployed to Sandy Cay in four rubber boats and had “observed the illegal presence” of a Chinese Coast Guard vessel and seven China maritime militia vessels.locator mapPosting footage of their own flag being displayed, Tarriela added: “This operation reflects the unwavering dedication and commitment of the Philippine government to uphold the country’s sovereignty, sovereign rights and jurisdiction in the West Philippine Sea.”Beijing claims sovereignty over almost all of theSouth China Seaand has waved away competing assertions from other countries in the region as well as an international ruling that its position has no legal basis.At the opening ceremony in Manila for the joint US-Philippines military drills, which began on Monday last week, US Marine Corps Lieutenant General James Glynn said the two sides would “demonstrate not just our will to uphold our mutual defence treaty in existence since 1951 but our matchless capability to do so”.“Nothing builds bonds more quickly than shared adversity,” he said, without specifying a common threat.Beijing said the military manoeuvres “undermine regional strategic stability” and accused Manila of “collusion with countries outside the region”.With Agence France-PresseExplore more on these topicsChinaAsia PacificPhilippinesSouth China SeanewsShareReuse this content"

It was already a tense time to be an immigrant. Rioters, propelled by false claims online that the man who had murdered children in Southport was an asylum seeker, were descending on hotels housing refugees, trying to burn them alive.The message alerted the Hongkongers to posts on far-right channels suggesting some new targets. “They all help refugees who come to the UK to take resources,” one of them read.WhenFinn Lausaw the message he felt a pulse of dread. Not only was his name on the list of targets but so were two addresses where he had recently lived. In the London office where he works as a chartered surveyor, Lau stared at the posts. They looked like just more examples of the flood of hatred that poured through social media during the riots. But Lau believed this was something more sinister.Lau, now 31, was among the activists whose role leading Hong Kong’s democracy movement catapulted them into confrontation with China’s authoritarian rulers. Many have fled into exile in the UK, where they continue to campaign. Educated, organised and articulate, they rank among the dissidents Beijing is most determined to crush.Lau and his fellow activists have been called traitors, with bounties on their heads that are three times what the authorities offer for murderers. Relatives back home have been arrested and intimidated. As he read the posts, Lau suspected a chilling new tactic: an attempt to harness far-right violence.View image in fullscreenFinn Lau and other activists have bounties on their heads that are three times what Chinese authorities offer for murderers.Photograph: Teri Pengilley/The GuardianWorking with the anti-racism group Hope Not Hate, the Guardian found more than 150 posts from 29 accounts on three days in August 2024 that sought to draw the attention of anti-immigrant groups and the far right to Lau and other Hong Kong exiles. Cybersecurity experts who have reviewed the posts say they exhibited some similarities toa major online influence operation that a Chinese security agency is suspected of orchestrating.As Keir Starmer courts Beijing in search of economic growth, his security minister, Dan Jarvis, told the Guardian: “National security is the first duty of this government. Any attempt by a foreign government to coerce, intimidate or harm their critics overseas, undermining democracy and the rule of law, is wholly unacceptable.“We continue to assess potential threats and work with our partners to counter foreign interference. We will make sure the security services and law enforcement agencies have the tools they need to deter, detect and disrupt modern-day state threats.”Posts on X inciting attacks on Lau and others were directed at far-right figures, including Tommy Robinson. “They’re even supporting the Muslim minorities too!” read one post denouncing Hongkongers, sent to the Reform UK MP Richard Tice. It gave the date and location of a planned gathering of Hongkongers a few days later. Posts on Telegram appeared in the channels of the leaders of the white nationalist group Patriotic Alternative.Online incitement appears to represent a novel weapon in the arsenal that projects Beijing’s power. Lau is one of the opponents of the regime – Hongkongers as well as Tibetans, Uyghurs, Taiwanese and campaigners for democracy – subjected to what the US-based advocacy group Freedom House calls “the most sophisticated, global and comprehensive campaign of transnational repression in the world”.The Guardian has worked with a team of reporters convened by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) to document this campaign. TheChina Targetsreporting team has identified 105 victims in 23 countries and catalogued the techniques the regime uses as it pursues its opponentsbeyond its borders.There have beenabductions,forced renditionsand harrowing accounts of China’s “black jails”. Compared with some of the more lethal methods used against opponents of Russian, Iranian, Indian and Saudi authoritarians, China’s model seems subtler, which may make it more effective. It relies on a powerful force: fear.‘Extremely scared’When the first posts identified by the Guardian appeared on 12 August last year, the targets had every reason to take the threat seriously. After a wave of riots, Starmer had said the government remained on high alert. He had cancelled his summer holiday to oversee the deployment of 6,000 police officers to deter further unrest. “We had Hongkongers in refugee hotels,” says Lau. “Some of them were extremely scared.”X messagesThe fake accounts tried to imitate genuine online interaction.Minutes later, “Curry Curry” replied with a list of UK addresses of Hong Kong pro-democracy groups and activists, including one whose profile was even higher than Lau’s. “Everyone knows what to do now, right? I recommend visiting Nathan Law first!” read a post from an account under the name Declan Dene McFly. This account then posted a screenshot of Apple Maps with the location pointer hanging over an address for Law.The Chinese regime saysNathan Lawis a criminal suspect wanted by Hong Kong police for endangering national security. Law, a leader of the movement that sought to salvage the freedoms promised to Hongkongers when they reverted from British to Chinese control, was imprisoned for months in 2017. He fought on. But when the national security law that Beijing imposed in 2020 meant protesters faced life sentences, Law joined anexodusof 100,000 Hongkongers who have come to the UK since the crackdown.After Law was granted UK asylum in 2021, China’s foreign ministry spokespersonsaidthe UK “should immediately correct its mistakes and stop interfering in Hong Kong affairs, which are China’s domestic affairs”. After members of the US Congress nominated Law for a Nobel peace prize, Time magazine named him among 2020’smost influential peopleand Joe Biden invited him to a summit on democracy, an “extremely furious” Hong Kong security chiefcalledLaw a “modern-day traitor” who was spreading “lies”.View image in fullscreenNathan Law: an Apple Map’s screenshot showing his address was publicised by a fake account.Photograph: Andy Hall/The ObserverBoyish, bespectacled but toughened by years of struggle, Law, 31, has endured one of the most testing methods in the regime’s repressive playbook. His mother and brother were detained by Hong Kong police and interrogated in 2023. Though they were released – after his brotherdenouncedhim on Instagram – Law and his relatives know the authorities could come for them again.The detentions came shortly after the Hong Kong government offered a HK$1m (about £100,000)bountyfor information leading to the arrest of Law, Lau, and other exiled dissidents. In May 2024, British police disrupted a suspected surveillance operation apparently directed by China. Law and Lau are believed to have been among the targets.A few months later, the social media posts urging far-right groups to attack Hong Kong activists began. “It’s outrageous,” says Law, “the way they try to inciteviolence towards me and try to divide society. I hope no one will take them seriously.”Influence campaignAt first glance, the posts read as though British bigots were calling for attacks on the Hongkongers. But the language was oddly stilted. One read: “There are too many foreigners in my community now, and the security is worse.” Grammatical errors suggested a limited command of English. “They are all helping asylum seeker,” a profile named Yannie posted to Laura Towler, the deputy leader ofPatriotic Alternative. Members of this group have since been jailed for offences during the riots.That post, like many of the others, appeared on Telegram, a Russian-founded app with few restrictions on what users can say. Others were published on X. Patriotic Alternative is banned from Elon Musk’s platform but he has allowed the far-right figurehead Tommy Robinson to return. “HK refugees keeps coming our country attributing to the effort of the following organisations and people,” someone going by MaryAnnie posted to Robinson. There followed a list of four Hong Kong pro-democracy organisations and two addresses for Lau.Get in touch embedOne curious aspect to MaryAnnie’s tweet was that it was sent at 3.58am. Dozens more, from this account and others were sent at similar times – during the working day inChina. And many of the 29 profiles shared the same image of a list of addresses in a typeface usually used for Chinese. Several of the Telegram accounts have changed their profile names to Chinese characters. Three of the X profiles went on to post in Chinese. One of them follows only one account: China’s vice-minister of foreign affairs.Experts at Graphika, a New York-based social media analysis company, reviewed the posts identified by the Guardian. The activity “echoes aspects” of a major Chinese online influence campaign that Graphika identified in 2019 and namedSpamouflage Dragon, the analysts said.The Graphika analysts agreed with other experts who said the social media campaign against Hongkongers could not definitively be attributed to Spamouflage Dragon because of differences in the style of posting. But they said posts identified by the Guardian showed “similarities to past activity Graphika and others have attributed to Chinese state-linked influence operations”.Analysts at the Microsoft Threat Analysis Center say Spamouflage Dragon’s “impact is limited but its ability to rapidly respond to current events and propagate narratives across various platforms highlights its potential to fuel division”. They believe “with high confidence” that it is orchestrated by China’s ministry of public security (MPS), a key agency in the authoritarian system.In 2023, American prosecutors broughtchargesagainst 34 MPS officers in Beijing, accusing them of running “transnational repression schemes” in the US and worldwide. The MPS officers allegedly deployed a troll farm “to target people of Chinese descent who had the courage to speak out against the Chinese Communist Party”.‘The overseas struggle’In response to the Guardian’s findings, a spokesperson for China’s embassy in the UK said: “The so-called ‘transnational repression’ by China is pure fabrication. China always respects the sovereignty of other countries and conducts law enforcement and judicial cooperation with other countries in accordance with the law.”Under Xi Jinping, who since taking power in 2012 has gripped the country more tightly than any leader since Mao Zedong, what politburo members call “the overseas struggle” has been vigorously pursued. The ICIJ team has found China-backed groups monitoring and intimidating human rights activists at the UN in Geneva.Chinese cyber-attackers – groups of whom have allegedlyhackedinto US presidential campaigns and critical infrastructure as well as UK parliamentarians’ emails – have been turned on the party’s opponents worldwide. And the posts inciting far-right attacks on Hongkongers matched a pattern identified by thecybersecurity experts who reviewed them. They say social media campaigns believed to be orchestrated by the Chinese regime use a vast network of accounts to give the impression of grassroots support.Telegram messagesAt least one other authoritarian regime is suspected of using social media to exploit the UK’s social divisions. A network of Telegram channels with Russian links was recentlydiscovered, offering cryptocurrency payments as rewards for attacks on British Muslims and mosques. Gregory Davis, of Hope Not Hate, said the British far right were “seen as ‘useful idiots’ and a potential tool to destabilise the country on behalf of foreign powers”.Laura Harth, of Safeguard Defenders, a group that documents the Chinese regime’s abuses, said Chinese troll accounts had been seizing on current events around the world as opportunities to target their victims. “Their aim is to make people afraid but also keep them occupied and distracted,” she said.Sense of forebodingThe message in the Hongkongers’ social media group alerting them to the posts was accompanied by a few words in Chinese: “Someone on the internet posted these photos and their addresses, and now people are worried about going to visit them and whether they will end up visiting someone else.”Lau, scrutinising the message in his London office, spotted that it came from an account in the same name as one of those disseminating addresses for him and others to the far right. This convinced him that its purpose was to ensure he and the rest of the targets knew they were in danger.Scrupulously polite, Lau is at pains to emphasise he bears no ill will towards Britons who, he says, may have been driven to unrest by deindustrialisation, the crime rate or the consequences of the 2008 banking crash. Nonetheless, the menacing social media posts have added to his sense of foreboding.View image in fullscreenFinn Lau: ‘I have become extremely cautious when I am on the street.’Photograph: Teri Pengilley/The GuardianLau was already watchful. In 2020, three masked men set on him as he walked along the Thames in west London. His last thought as he passed out was that he was going to die. He feels sure the Chinese regime had a hand in the attack. The police classified it as a hate crime but no charges have been brought.Lau moves house often. By the time of the social media posts in August 2024, he was no longer at either of the addresses that were published. But he could not know whether his current address would also be posted. He has since moved again.Although there are no reports that the online incitement succeeded in triggering physical attacks, Lau and at least one of the others targeted in the posts reported them to the Metropolitan police.The force said it did not comment on “matters of protective security in relation to any specific individuals”, but it added: “Counter-terrorism policing remains alive to any attempts from across borders to target or threaten individuals who are in the UK and we continue to work extremely closely with our intelligence and security partners in the UK and abroad to combat any such activity.”As far as the Hongkongers know, the force has taken no action in their cases. They are left to wonder who, if anyone, is protecting them.Lau hopes that the police will look again at the attempted incitement. “I have become extremely cautious when I am on the street,” he said. “That’s the direct consequence. I keep looking round.”Explore more on these topicsHong KongThe China Targets projectChinaFar rightAsia PacificSocial medianewsShareReuse this content"

It points to its record between 2013 and 2022 compared with what has happened under Labor over the past three years.Speaking to the ABC’s RN Breakfast on Monday, the Coalition climate change and energy spokesperson, Ted O’Brien, said “under the former Coalition government you saw emissions fall” – from 12% to 29% less than 2005 levels. And that in Labor’s three years in office emissions “have flatlined”, showing the ALP has “failed”.There is a bit going on here so let’s break it down.Let’s be honest: Australia’s claim to have cut climate pollution isn’t as good as it seems | Adam MortonRead moreEmissions from land and forestsIn purely numerical terms, O’Brien is correct in saying that emissions fell when the Coalition was in power. But a look at the data shows the reduction was not a result of its policies. In reality, it often took steps to prevent deeper cuts to pollution.According tothe climate department greenhouse gas inventory, annual emissions were about 113.8m tonnes of carbon dioxide lower when the Coalition left office than when it was elected. Sounds good at first blush.But nearly all of this fall – 100.4m tonnes – was due to claimed changes in emissions from the land and forests.Sign up for the Afternoon Update: Election 2025 email newsletterWhen the Coalition was elected, officials believe the landscape across the country released 12m tonnes in net terms. By the time it was voted out of office, they estimate the land and vegetation was absorbing much more CO2– 88.4 tonnes – from the atmosphere than it emitted.There are a couple of points to make about this. Firstly, historic emissions data for the land sector is repeatedly being revised and there is uncertainty in its accuracy – much more so than in emissions data from electricity, industry or cars.Secondly, the Coalition did nothing, or next-to-nothing, to drive this change.It is not evidence of climate policy that cuts emissions and drives a shift to a cleaner economy. As we have written, there is a strong case that land-sector emissions – while important – should not be counted in the national accounts as they can be used to mask continuing or increasing fossil fuel use. This is a problem when claimed changes in the land sector is easily the biggest contributor to changes in the greenhouse accounts.Emissions fell in one other area Coalition was in power – from the power grid. Pollution from electricity was down 27.2m tonnes.4:09Voting 101: Should you vote above or below the line this election? Why does it matter? – videoThis was overwhelmingly due to a national renewable energy target set under Labor. Famously, Tony Abbott considered abolishing it but didn’t have the votes. Instead, he legislated to reduce the target, with Labor support.The target ultimately still drove rapid construction of solar and windfarms to replace coal power in the second half of the last decade. This cut emissions. But it can hardly be claimed as Coalition policy.Emissions from other parts of the economy – notablytransportandmajor industry– continued to increase as the Coalition chose either to not introduce or not enforce steps that limit them.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toClear Air AustraliaFree newsletterAdam Morton brings you incisive analysis about the politics and impact of the climate crisisEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Scott Morrison resisted global callsfor that time to be used for a “green recovery”– to use the economic stimulus required to accelerate climate action – and instead aimed for a “gas-fired recovery” to boost fossil fuel use.Exclusion zones: is Peter Dutton’s campaign avoiding proposed nuclear power sites?Read moreSince Labor’s election, emissions have more or less flatlined, as O’Brien says.We have data for only the first two years and a bit. Officials estimate national pollution fell 1.4% over that time – nothing like the pace of reduction required. It is partly explained by pollution bouncing back as the economy reopened after Covid-19 limitations.Policy promisesIn terms of what happens from here, experts say the difference between the two parties is clear.Labor has policies designed to either reduce or limit emissions inelectricity, majorindustryandtransport. Analysts, scientists and crossbench MPs say it could and should be doing more, and point out it has released only one climate-related policy during the campaign –a subsidy for household batteries. Labor has delayed significant decisions and announcements – on a 2035 emissions reduction target and policies to meet it – until after the election.But the Coalition plans to unwind or scrap nearly all Labor’s policies, and hasreleased none of its own to cut emissions in the next decade at least.Notably, it plans to slow the rollout of large-scale renewable energy and instead burn more coal and gas for electricity until it says it can build taxpayer-funded nuclear generators, mostly after 2040.The Climate Change Authority estimates this could lead toan extra 2bn tonnes of emissions compared with Labor’s policy. To put this into context, Australia’s total annual emissions are about 440m tonnes.On Sunday, the ABC’s David Speers asked the Nationals’ frontbencher Bridget McKenzie what the Coalition would do to cut emissions in the next decade. She laughed, and did not directly answer the question.Explore more on these topicsAustralian election 2025Election Reality CheckClimate crisisFossil fuelsGreenhouse gas emissionsEnergyCoalitionLiberal partyanalysisShareReuse this content"

On Essential’s separate “two-party-plus” vote, which allows voters to remain undecided, Labor was at 49.6% and the Coalition on 45.6%, with 4.8% undecided.Tuesday’s poll result was a slightly better result for the Coalition fromthe previous poll in mid-April, where Labor was ahead 50% to 45%, with the balance undecided.The Essential poll isin line with all other published polls. The Coalition has recently claimed that published polls are not in line with their internal research, which they claim paint a rosier picture for Dutton’s prospects of forming government.The Essential poll finds Labor leads the Coalition among men (51% to 49%) and women (54% to 46%) on a two-party basis. Labor also leads among those aged 18-34 (58% to 42%) and those aged 35-54 (57% to 43%), while the Coalition leads among those over 55 years of age (56% to 44%).Albanese himself retains a slight negative approval rating, with 44% approving of his performance and 47% disapproving, for a net approval of minus 3%. Albanese’s total approval remained the same from the last poll, but the number of people who “strongly” approve of his performance moved from 10% to 13% over the month.Dutton’s approval ratings, however, further deteriorated to a net of minus 12% (39% approve, 51% disapprove). It continues a major cratering from December 2024, when Dutton had a plus 3% rating (44% approve, 41% disapprove).The Liberal leader’s disapproval shot up another three points from mid-April.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toAfternoon Update: Election 2025Free daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key election campaign stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Why does it matter? – videoAsked about the election campaign itself, and how it had affected their vote, 23% of respondents said they were now more likely to vote Labor, compared with 19% of people saying they were more likely to vote Coalition. Another 12% said the campaign made them more likely to vote Greens, 17% said they were more likely to vote independent, while 28% said the campaign had no impact on their voting intention.A key question at the heart of the election is whether Australians will vote based on their feelings about the last three years of Labor government or based on their expectations for the coming years. After three years of high inflation, rising prices and concerns about social cohesion, Dutton’s campaign has regularly asked, “Are you better off today than three years ago?”Meanwhile, Albanese and Labor have said Australia is “turning the corner” and that better days are ahead.Asked what was more important when considering their vote, 66% said they were thinking about which party would make them better off in three years and 34% said they would think about whether they were better off than three years ago.

This would require the governmentto continue slashing its reliance on consultantsover several years.A re-elected Labor government would also claw back $760m by increasing the cost of student visa applications to $2,000 (up from $1,600) from 1 July. This would take the total new savings to more than $7bn. These changes alone are not enough to cover Labor’s promised 18m extra bulk-billed GP visits a year.Beyond the additional savings, there were few surprises in Labor’s policy costings given it handed down a budget days before the election campaign was called.Labor’s plan for a 24/7 nationwide health advice and after-hours GP telehealth service backed by Medicare – already announced on the campaign trail – will cost $204.5m. Just $16.5m of Labor’s promised $1bn mental health package will be delivered next financial year.‘Spending will be crucial’Earlier on Monday, the New York-based S&P Global Ratings warned the budget was “already regressing to moderate deficits as public spending hits postwar highs, global trade tensions intensify, and growth slows”.“How the elected government funds its campaign pledges and rising spending will be crucial for maintaining the rating,” the agency said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toAfternoon Update: Election 2025Free daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key election campaign stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Hundreds stumbled along pitch-black metro tunnels using their phone torches; others scrambled for basics in supermarkets that could only take cash, or began long trudges home from work.Mobile networks went down and internet access was cut as power failed at 12.33pm (11.33 BST). Hospitals postponed routine operations but used generators to attend to critical cases, and while electronic banking was able to function on backup systems, most ATM screens were blank.Spain and Portugal power outage: what caused it, and was there a cyber-attack?Read moreIn scenes reminiscent of the 2003 outage that caused widespread blackouts in the US north-east, rail services across the Iberian peninsula were halted, air traffic disrupted and traffic lights extinguished.

But they will … All potential causes are being analysed and no hypothesis or possibility is being ruled out.”The Portuguese operator, REN, said the outage was caused by a “rare atmospheric phenomenon”, with extreme temperature variations in Spain causing “anomalous oscillations” in very high-voltage lines.REN said the phenomenon, known as “induced atmospheric vibration”, caused “synchronisation failures between the electrical systems, leading to successive disturbances across the interconnected European network”.Widespread outages are unusual in Europe. In 2003, a problem with a hydroelectric power line between Italy and Switzerland caused blackouts for about 12 hours, and in 2006 an overloaded power network in Germany caused electricity cuts across parts of the country and in France, Italy, Spain, Austria, Belgium and the Netherlands.Sánchez thanked France and Morocco for sending additional electricity to Spain, and said the current shortfall would be eased using gas and hydroelectric power.The prime minister said additional national police and Guardia Civil officers had been deployed across the country to ensure people’s safety overnight, adding that hospitals were functioning well thanks to the efforts of healthcare workers.View image in fullscreenThe outages created long queues for transport, such as buses, that were still operational.Photograph: Bruna Casas/ReutersHe said telecommunications services were still suffering interruptions, mainly because of a lack of electricity supply to antennae.Sánchez said that only 344 of the 6,000 flights in Spain on Monday had been cancelled, and that the country’s roads network was working well, barring some tailbacks.The main travel disruption had occurred on the rail network, where 35,000 passengers trapped on more than 100 trains had been helped by rail companies and the military emergencies unit. Eleven more trains that had stopped in remote areas were still waiting to be reached.In Madrid and other cities, traffic lights ceased to function, causing gridlock as vehicles slowed to avoid collisions, while metros were halted. Spain’s national road authority, DGT, urged motorists to avoid using the roads as much as possible.El País newspaper posted photos and video on its website of passengers navigating darkened metro tunnels in the Spanish capital and police directing traffic on the city’s streets. Footage also showed its own reporters working by torchlight.The Spanish health ministry said in a social media update it was in contact with regional authorities to assess the scope of the widespread blackout but reassured the public that hospitals had supplementary systems in place.In Portugal, the outage hit the capital, Lisbon, and surrounding areas, as well as northern and southern parts of the country. Lisbon metro carriages were evacuated and ATMs and electronic payment systems cut out.The Portuguese water supplier EPAL said water supplies could be disrupted, prompting queues to form at stores as people rushed to buy bottled water and other emergency supplies such as gas lights, generators and battery-powered radios.View image in fullscreenShops were swamped by people looking for emergency items, such as torches and radios.Photograph: Adri Salido/Getty ImagesSánchez said that eight of Spain’s 17 autonomous regions – Andalucía, Castilla-La Mancha, Extremadura, Galicia, La Rioja, Madrid, Murcia and Valencia – had declared level 3 emergencies, placing responsibility for the response in the hands of the central government. He said schools in those areas would be open on Tuesday, but would not be offering regular classes.He said the situation across the country remained very “asymmetric” on Monday night, with some regions already having 90% of their power restored, while others had recovered less than 15%.Sánchez also advised non-essential workers to stay home on Tuesday if necessary.“It’s going to be a long night,” he said. “But we’re going to keep working to get back to normal as quickly as possible.”Explore more on these topicsSpainPortugalEuropeEnergy industrynewsShareReuse this content"

It added that the sides would continue working “on how we can mitigate the impact of fluctuations in the global economic order”.However, the summit comes as the UK continues tariff negotiations with the US in the hope of carving out a special deal. Britain is facing a 10% tariff, while theEU faces 20%.Ahead of a meeting with the UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, last week, the leader of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, called for a drive to unlock investment for renewables in the North Sea.“We are friends. And we are Europeans. It means that we share interests and democratic values. And that we are ready to face global challenges as like-minded partners,” von der Leyen said after their meeting.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

So you’d expect us to be discussing a wide range of issues with the EU and obviously get an update on that at the summit.“The prime minister has spoken extensively recently about the benefits of free and open trade and the fact that we’re looking to strengthen alliances around the world to reduce barriers to trade, working with other economies. And that is actually a feature of our discussions, not just with the EU, but the US, India, and other countries as well.”Explore more on these topicsEuropean UnionBrexitEuropeYoung peoplenewsShareReuse this content"

Trust in our democracy is damaged like never before in our country’s postwar history.”Merz,a former banker, said that Johann Wadephul, a conservative MP who has long advised Merz on foreign policy, would become the new foreign minister.Wadephul has been a supporter of military backing forUkraineand recently told the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ) newspaper the war in Ukraine “is not about a few square kilometres in Ukraine but rather the fundamental question of whether we will allow a classic war of conquest in Europe”.Merz said that despite domestic misgivings about Germany’s role in Ukraine, with some calling for a halt to weapons deliveries, there were “no ifs or buts” about its continued support. Vladimir Putin’s invasion, he said, was nothing less than a battle “against the entire political order of the European continent”.Germany, he stressed, would remain “on the side of this attacked country and therefore on the side of all people inEuropewho are committed to democracy and the rule of law … to freedom and an open society.”His statement came hours after Boris Pistorius, a social democrat who is widely expected to continue in the role as defence minister, said Donald Trump’s peace deal proposals were “akin to a capitulation”.Pistorius and Wadephul are expected to work closely together in a newly formed national security council to represent Germany on the European and international stage.In a nod to Trump but without naming him, Merz said on Monday: “We have come to the realisation that we can no longer be certain of the transatlantic relationship in the spirit of freedom and the rules-based order.”Merz and his government are due to be sworn into parliament on 6 May, ending six months of political gridlock. His conservative CDU/CSU alliance agreed a deal to coalesce with the Social Democrats (SPD) after winning a federal election on 23 February, in which the far-right populist Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) came second.The results of a poll of the SPD’s 365,000 members approving the deal is expected on Wednesday. Only once they have given the green light will the SPD announce its cabinet ministers, said the party’s co-leader Lars Klingbeil.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He would do so, he said, by tackling “irregular” immigration that had “got out of hand” over the past decade, an allusion to his predecessor Angela Merkel’s so-called open-door policy during which about 1 million refugees came to Germany.Among his surprise appointments is that of Karsten Wildberger, the chief executive of Ceconomy, the parent company of the German electronic retailers Saturn and Mediamarkt, who will head a new ministry for digitalisation and modernisation of the state.He will, in part, be responsible for deciding how a special multibillion euro fund – controversially passed by the outgoing government to boost Germany’s ailing infrastructure and its shrinking economy, as well as strengthening its defence forces – is to be spent.Explore more on these topicsGermanyEuropeFriedrich MerzUkrainenewsShareReuse this content"

Its Portuguese counterpart, Redes Energéticas Nacionais (REN), said the outage started at 11:33am Western European summer time.By mid-afternoon the Spanish operator, which is partly state-owned, said that it had started to recover voltage in the north, south and west of the Iberian peninsula. The recovery process could only be carried out gradually, to avoid overloading parts of the grid as each generator connects.Endesa, Spain’s largest energy utility with 10 million customers, and Iberdrola, the second largest provider, said they were working with REE in accordance with established protocols.What caused it?The Portuguese prime minister, Luís Montenegro, said that the issue originated in Spain. Portugal’s REN said a “rare atmospheric phenomenon” had caused a severe imbalance in temperatures that led to the widespread shutdowns.REN said: “Due to extreme temperature variations in the interior of Spain, there were anomalous oscillations in the very high voltage lines (400 kV), a phenomenon known as ‘induced atmospheric vibration’. These oscillations caused synchronisation failures between the electrical systems, leading to successive disturbances across the interconnected European network.”The risks posed to electrical systems by big variations in atmospheric temperatures are well known in the industry, even if it is rare for problems to manifest on this scale.“Due to the variation of the temperature, the parameters of the conductor change slightly,” said Taco Engelaar, managing director at Neara, a software provider to energy utilities. “It creates an imbalance in the frequency.”Georg Zachmann, a senior fellow at Bruegel, a Brussels thinktank, saidthe system had suffered “cascading disconnections of power plants” – including one in France – when the frequency of the grid dropped below the European standard of 50Hz.Could it have been it foul play?The European Council president, António Costa, who was Portugal’s prime minister from 2015 to 2024, said “there is no evidence that it was a cyber-attack”, but cautioned that the ultimate cause was still unclear. Senior European Commission vice-president Teresa Ribera also told Spain’sRadio 5that there was no evidence of a deliberate act having caused the outage.However, Spain’s national security council was convened on Monday to assess the outage. Portugal’s prime minister said it was too early to say for sure what caused the blackout.What is the role of renewables?View image in fullscreenIberdrola wind turbines. Spain has been a leader in renewable power generation.Photograph: Sergio Pérez/ReutersSpain is on its way to being a green energy leader: it has abundant sun and wind. Last year was a record period for renewable power generation, which accounted for 56% of all electricity used. By 2030 that proportion will rise to 81%.That shift will help Spain end its reliance on energy imports, but it also brings its own challenges. Every national grid in the world will need to spend heavily to upgrade distribution systems to connect scattered renewable generation and ensure it is balanced.What is grid balancing?The grid needs constant management to ensure it is not overloaded by too much generation, or left short by too little. Power stations will shut down automatically if the frequency breaks out of normal range. To restart they must then be reconnected to users.Balancing has been important as long as there has been a grid, but there is more focus on the issue because of therapid switch to renewables like solar and wind, which are intermittent.Spinning gas turbines have been the standard technology for managing the frequency for decades, but renewables will need investment inother options such as flywheelsor advanced power electronics.“You cannot ignore it,” Zachmann said. “You need the tools to keep the system running.”Did international connections cause problems?Engelaar said such a widespread failure was “extremely unusual”. However, there have been previous examples. In 2003 a problem with a hydroelectric power line between Italy and Switzerland caused ahuge outage across Italyfor about 12 hours. A2006 German power overloadcaused outages as far away as Portugal and Morocco.“Interconnection between countries is vital for sharing clean energy, but it also creates new pathways for failure to spread quickly,” Engelaar said.However, Bruegel’s Zachmann said that interconnections also help to prevent problems from getting worse. The interconnector with France will make it “much easier to bring the electricity system back”. “Yes, problems spill over but at the same time the larger system acts as a buffer and prevents the crisis escalating,” he said.Explore more on these topicsEnergy industrySpainPortugalFranceEuropeexplainersShareReuse this content"

He has repeatedly referred to a “deep state” inIsraelthat he alleges seeks to thwart democratically elected leaders and undermine elected governments.The relationship between Netanyahu and Bar, a former special forces soldier who holds degrees from Tel Aviv and Harvard universities, deteriorated afterthe publication in March of a Shin Bet reporton the 7 October 2023 attacks by Hamas militants in southern Israel. The service admitted to mistakes but criticised policies of the Netanyahu government that it said had enabled Hamas to build up its strength in Gaza and catch Israel by surprise.4:35Could the West Bank become the next Gaza? – video explainerNetanyahu has never accepted any responsibility for Israel’s worst national security disaster, which killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and led to 251 being abducted and held hostage in Gaza. Eighteen months after the attack, many of the senior officials in post at the time have resigned or been forced out. Netanyahu appears unlikely to leave power before elections late next year and may stay on beyond then.Bar’s authorisation for Shin Bet to open two investigations into Netanyahu’s close aides, including one forallegedly taking payments from Qatar to promote its interests in Israelat the same time that Qatar was partly financing Hamas in Gaza, has been widely cited as a motive for his dismissal. Netanyahu is already facing a multitude of corruption charges in court, and political opponents have alleged the prime minister wanted to remove Bar in order to sabotage the investigations.Netanyahu has consistently denied any improper or ulterior reasons for firing Bar.“To this day, the reason for my firing is not clear to me,” Bar wrote in his supreme court affidavit. “But … it was not rooted in any professional metric, but out of an expectation by Netanyahu that I would be personally loyal to him.”Yair Lapid, Israel’s opposition leader, praised Bar’s decision and criticised Netanyahu. “Of those responsible for the greatest failure in the history of the country, only one remains, clinging to the chair,” Lapid said.The priority of Shin Bet is counter-terrorism, but the service also investigates espionage, manages security clearance for thousands of sensitive posts and has a legal duty to defend Israel’s democratic system.Bar took over the service in 2021, having been appointed by the then prime minister, Naftali Bennett, and was expected to serve the standard five-year term.Bar was one of the first senior security officials to accept responsibility for the many failures that led to the 2023 attacks, and made it clear he intended to resign.He has stayed on this long, associates and supporters said last month, to work towards the release of hostages still held by Hamas in Gaza and to protect Shin Bet from political manoeuvres.Explore more on these topicsIsraelBenjamin NetanyahuIsrael-Gaza warMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Three months into his presidency, not only is the war in Ukraine continuing and the war in Gaza restarted, but in Yemen, the number of civilian casualties caused by US bombing is rapidly and deliberately escalating.Sixty-eight were killed overnight, the Houthis said, when the US military bombed a detention centre holding African migrants in Saada, north-west Yemen, as part of a campaign against the rebel group. In the words of the US Central Command (Centcom), its purpose is to “restore freedom of navigation” in the Red Sea and, most significantly, “American deterrence”.Trump was ‘the candidate of peace’. Now he’s fanning the flames of war | Mohamad BazziRead moreA month ago, whenUS bombing against the Houthis restarted, the peace-promising Trump pledged that “the Houthi barbarians” would eventually be “completely annihilated”. It is a highly destructive target, in line perhaps with the commitments made by Israeli leaders to “eliminate” Hamas after 7 October, and certainly in keeping with statements from Trump’s defence secretary, Pete Hegseth, that the US military must focus on “lethality, lethality, lethality”.Photographs from Almasirah, a Houthi media organisation, showed a shattered building with bodies inside the wreckage. TV footage showed one victim calling out for his mother in Amharic, the official language of Ethiopia. It is not immediately obvious they were material to the Houthi war effort, in which the group has attacked merchant shipping in the Red Sea and tried to strike targets in Israel.That the Houthis have sought to fight on behalf of Palestinians in Gaza is not in dispute but what has changed is that the US military response –joint US and UK airstrikeswhen Joe Biden was in the White House – has escalated. The data clearly suggests that previous restraints on causing civilian casualties have been relaxed.Approximately 80 Yemeni civilians were estimated killed and 150 injuredin a bombing raid on Ras Isa porton 18 April, according to the Yemen Data Project, a conflict monitor. The aim, Centcom said, was to destroy the port’s ability to accept fuel, whose receipt it said was controlled by the Houthis, and, the US military added, “not intended to harm the people of Yemen” – though the country is already devastated by 11 years of civil war. Half its 35 million peopleface severe food insecurity.So far, theTrump administrationbombing campaign, Operation Rough Rider, is estimated to have caused more than 500 civilian casualties, of whom at least 158 were killed. Compare that with the previous campaign, Operation Poseidon Archer, which ran under Biden from January 2024 to January 2025: the Yemen Data Project counted 85 casualties, a smaller number over a longer period.Parties in war are supposed to follow international humanitarian law, following theprinciple of distinctionbetween military and civilian targets, and respecting theprinciple of proportionality, where attacks that cause excessive civilian casualties relative to any military advantage gained are, in theory, a war crime.The clear signs from the US campaign in Yemen are that it is following a looser approach, mirroring the unprecedented level of civilian casualtiesin the Israel-Gaza war. It is hardly surprising, given that Hegseth has already closed the Pentagon’s civilian harm mitigation office, which handled policy in the area, and the related Civilian Protection Center of Excellence, responsible for training.That could make it difficult for traditional allies to assist. Whereas the UK participated in Poseidon Archer, British involvement in the latest operation has gone from minimal to nonexistent. No air-to-air refuelling was provided in the most recent attacks, the UK Ministry of Defence said, unlike in March.In justification, Centcom says that after striking 800 targets, Houthi ballistic missile launches are down 69% since 15 March. But one figure it does not cite is that transits of cargo ships in the Red Sea during March remain at half pre-October 2023 levels,according to Lloyd’s List. A broader peace in the region may prove more effective in restoring trade than an increase in demonstrative violence.Explore more on these topicsYemenUS militaryUS foreign policyHouthisTrump administrationDonald TrumpPete HegsethanalysisShareReuse this content"

The UN’s top court will hear from dozens of nations and organisations in order to draw up an advisory opinion on Israel’s humanitarian obligations to Palestinians more than 50 days into itstotal blockade on aid entering Gaza.Israel is not participating but has submitted oral evidence claiming its decision last October to end all cooperation with Unrwa, the UN relief agency for Palestinians, was necessary because of infiltration by Hamas.Blinne Ní Ghrálaigh, the counsel for the Palestinian state, described Israel’s actions as “antithetical to a peace-loving state”. She said the restrictions on “the fundamental rights of the Palestinian people, [Israel’s] attacks on theUnited Nationsand on UN officials, property and premises, its deliberate obstruction of the organisation’s work and its attempt to destroy an entire UN subsidiary organ” were “unprecedented in the history of the organisation”.They amounted to “a fundamental repudiation by Israel of its charter obligations owed both to the organisation and to all UN members and of the international rule of law”, she said.Warning that the international order was crumbling and expressing “the continuing desperate hope that international law might finally prevail”, Ní Ghrálaigh urged the court to reset the moral compass enshrined in the UN charter by ordering Israel to permit aid to enter Gaza, and by restoring cooperation with Unrwa.She said Israel had closed all crossings and turned Rafah, once a refuge for almost 1.5 million displaced Palestinians, into a post-apocalyptic wasteland.“Plans are reportedly under way for Israel to annex 75 sq km of Rafah, one-fifth of Gaza, to Israel’s so-called buffer zone, permanently. This, together with Israel’s continuing maritime blockade, cuts Gaza and its people off from direct aid and assistance and from the rest of the world,” Ní Ghrálaigh said.She said: “Gaza is now home to the largest cohort of child amputees in the world, the largest orphan crisis in modern history, and a whole generation in danger of suffering from stunting, causing irreparable physical and cognitive impairments; over 15,600 children have been killed violently. Tens of thousands more of Gaza’s children are injured or missing, and many of those surviving are so traumatised that they openly express the wish to die.”Earlier in her 30-minute opening submission to the court, the UN undersecretary general for legal affairs, Elinor Hammarskjöld, opted for a full-throated assertion of the immunities and privileges of the UN and its subsidiary bodies under the UN charter and 1946 convention on UN privileges.She said Israel had no right unilaterally to declare UN bodies were not impartial and so deny cooperation or aid, adding: “When the basic elements of this [the charter’s] legal framework are not observed, the very nature of the work of the organisation on behalf of its member states is in jeopardy.”Hammarskjöld said that, if UN member states had complaints about the neutrality of an organisation such as Unrwa, established mechanisms existed for this to be addressed.View image in fullscreenElinor Hammarskjöld said Israel’s UN membership entailed legal obligations that were essential for the organisation to properly function.Photograph: Peter Dejong/APIsrael’s complaints had been examined by relevant UN bodies but the full cooperation of member states, including the furnishing of documents, was also required, she said. This was a thinly coded assertion that Israel has not backed up some of its claims of mass Hamas infiltration with evidence to the UN. Independent investigations have also found that Israel had not provided evidence for its headline allegation.In a sign of the breakdown in relations, Israel’s foreign minister, Gideon Sa’ar, said on Monday that the ICJ hearing was part of a “systematic persecution and delegitimisation of Israel”.“It is not Israel that should be on trial. It is the UN and Unrwa,” he told reporters in Jerusalem.In its written evidence to the court, Israel argues no obligation exists to respect the immunities of a UN agency “where the legitimate security concerns of a member state are severely undermined by the agency in question, whose conduct manifestly contravenes the fundamental principles of neutrality, impartiality and independence”.The UN general assembly has ordered the UN to seek an ICJ advisory opinion on whether Israel has overriden the immunities of a UN body by its policy of non cooperation. The policy has forced Unrwa to suspend operations in Gaza and the West Bank.4:35Could the West Bank become the next Gaza? – video explainerHammarskjöld told the court the proceedings were crucial to clarify some fundamental elements of the legal framework of the UN’s status. She pointed out that Israel’s UN membership entailed legal obligations that were essential for the organisation to properly function and carry out the mandates. These included “good faith and cooperation with the organisation, respect for the safety of UN premises, property assets and personnel, and obligations concerning the immunities of UN properties so that the UN can fulfil its obligations”.Israel strictly controls all inflows of international aid for the 2.4 million Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. It halted deliveries on 2 March, days before the collapse of a ceasefire that had significantly reduced hostilities after 15 months of war. Supplies are dwindling and the UN’s World Food Programme on Friday said it had sent out its “last remaining stocks” to kitchens.Paul Reichler, representing the Palestinians, told judges that one of the Geneva conventions “not only lays down that the occupying power must agree to relief schemes on behalf of the population, but insists that it must facilitate them by all the means at its disposal”.The UN was the first to address the court on Monday, followed by Palestinian representatives. In total, 40 states and four international organisations are scheduled to participate.On Tuesday, South Africa, a staunch critic of Israel, will present its arguments. In hearings last year in a separate case at the court,the country accused Israel of committing genocide against the Palestinians in Gaza– a charge Israel denies. Those proceedings are still under way. Israel’s’s ally, the US, is scheduled to speak on Wednesday.The court will probably take months to rule. Experts say the decision, though not legally binding, could profoundly impact international jurisprudence, international aid to Israel and public opinion.Explore more on these topicsInternational court of justiceIsrael-Gaza warPalestinian territoriesIsraelUnited NationsNetherlandsMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

A warrant was also obtained for the leader of Hamas’s military wing but was withdrawn after he was confirmed dead.The recent order imposing constraints on Khan comes amid tensions between the prosecutor and ICC judges over his handling of the Palestine investigation and several other cases in which he publicly announced his decision to seek warrants, a move that departed from his predecessor’s more discreet approach.Khan has in recent months said he has applied for, but not yet obtained,arrest warrants for Myanmar’s military leader, as well as theTaliban’s supreme leader and Afghanistan’s chief justice. He also indicated at a UN meeting he would seek warrants for peopleaccused of atrocities in Sudan’s West Darfur region.The flurry of announcements came as Khan faced the prospect of US economic sanctions against him – whichmaterialised in February– and in the wake ofsexual misconduct allegations against himby a member of his staff. Khan has denied the allegations, which external investigators are now examining.According to court officials with knowledge of internal discussions, the publicity generated by Khan’s statements has frustrated ICC judges and staff within the prosecutor’s office due to concerns his actions have departed from routine practice and placed pressure on the judges considering the applications.In their secret order in the Palestine case, the judges have blocked publicity that even alludes to the filing of applications for arrest warrants, and ordered Khan to refrain from disclosing any forthcoming requests unless he receives their permission.A separate panel of ICC judges had issued a similar order in at least one other case, three sources said, in an apparent sign of a wider crackdown on Khan’s approach.A spokesperson for the prosecutor said they “cannot confirm or deny the existence or content of any judicial decision which has not been made public by the court”.They said the prosecutor acted in accordance with the court’s legal framework and an arrest warrant application was “the outcome of an extensive, independent and impartial investigation in a situation under the court’s jurisdiction”.The strategy of going publicThe process for applying for ICC arrest warrants often occurs in closed proceedings. This can be to protect the integrity of investigations, ensure the safety of witnesses and victims, and improve the chances of locating and apprehending suspects.However, the prosecutor has significant autonomy and is able to publicise arrest warrant applications if, for example, it could have a deterrent effect on continuing alleged crimes and does not hinder arrest opportunities.Khan’s predecessor Fatou Bensouda revealed the existence of an arrest warrant only after it was approved by judges. The court’s first chief prosecutor, Luis Moreno Ocampo, publicly announced his intention to file applications on three occasions during his nine-year term.The international criminal court should prosecute Syria’s Assad | Kenneth RothRead moreOnce approved, an arrest warrant confirms there are “reasonable grounds to believe” the accused individual has committed a crime within the ICC’s jurisdiction, and establishes a legal mechanism to bring the accused to the court, which is based in The Hague, to stand trial.Khan first publicly announced an arrest warrant application in 2022, less than a year into his term, for suspects accused of crimes in Georgia. He repeated the strategy last year, when he revealed requests for warrants in the court’s Palestine investigation for Israeli and Hamas leaders in a dramaticvideo statementandinterview with CNN.The prosecutor’s decision to publicise the first round of arrest warrants in the Palestine case was opposed by some of Khan’s most senior staff, according to sources with knowledge of the investigation. The move, they said, placed the three judges overseeing the case under unprecedented public pressure.The panel of judges, whichapproved the warrants in November, appear to have now prevented Khan from following a similar approach when he files new arrest warrant applications in the case. Court sources said they expected the warrants to focus on alleged crimes in the West Bank.Bensouda launched the ICC’s Palestine caseas a formal criminal investigationin 2021. Khan inherited the inquiry and accelerated it after the Hamas-led 7 October attacks and Israel’s ensuing bombardment of Gaza.The investigation intensified in May 2024 with Khan’s decision to seek warrants for senior Israeli and Hamas officials, but it has continued to examine a range of other alleged crimes, both in the Gaza offensive and in theWest Bank, where there has been an intensification of Israeli settler violence and deadly military operations.The court did not respond to requests for comment.Do you have information about this story?

The US military had no immediate comment.The US has been conducting near-daily strikes against the Houthis since 15 March in an operation known as “Rough Rider”, seeking to end the threat it poses to vessels in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden.The Houthis started targeting Israeli and western vessels in the Red Sea in October 2023, in what they describe as solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza. The latest Houthi attack, on Saturday, targeted Israel’s Nevatim airbase with a Palestine-2 hypersonic ballistic missile. The missile was shot down by Israeli defences.View image in fullscreenRescuers transport the bodies of victims pulled from the rubble of a building hit in the strikes on Saada.Photograph: AFP/Getty ImagesGraphic footage aired by the Houthis’ al-Masirah satellite news channel in the aftermath of the strike on Sunday night showed what appeared to be dead bodies and others wounded at the detention centre.Yemen has long been a key transit country for people from Africa – mainly from Ethiopia and Somalia – trying to reach Saudi Arabia and Oman. One estimate claims there are more than 300,000 migrants across Yemen, a country devastated by a 10-year civil war. The Houthis allegedly make tens of thousands of dollars a week smuggling people over the border.Monday’s strike recalled a similar attack by a Saudi-led coalition battling the Houthis in 2022 on the same compound, which caused a collapse, killing 66 detainees and wounding 113 others, a UN report later said. The Houthis shot dead 16 detainees who fled after the strike and wounded another 50, the UN said. The Saudi-led coalition sought to justify the strike by saying the Houthis built and launched drones there, but the UN said it was known to be a detention facility.The US military has shifted tactics since the arrival of the Trump administration,which declared the Houthis as a foreign terrorist organisationin January. Since mid-March the US has mounted a much more sustained bombardment that is aimed at not only knocking out Houthi missile sites but also its political leadership, including Abdelmalek al-Houthi, the Houthi leader since 2004.In a statement early on Monday before news of the latest strike broke, US Central command said: “To preserve operational security, we have intentionally limited disclosing details of our ongoing or future operations. We are very deliberate in our operational approach, but will not reveal specifics about what we’ve done or what we will do.”View image in fullscreenA screengrab taken from a video released by the Houthi-run al-Masirah TV shows paramedics at the scene of the airstrike.Photograph: Houthis Al-Masirsah Tv/Handout/EPAIn March, Donald Trump claimed that the Houthis – the last militant group in Iran’s self-described “axis of resistance” that is capable of regularly attacking Israel – had been “decimated” by US strikes. But he also warned: “Stop shooting at US ships, and we will stop shooting at you. Otherwise, we have only just begun, and the real pain is yet to come, for both the Houthis and their sponsors in Iran.”The effectiveness of the US strikes is disputed and the Houthis in the past have shown an ability to withstand a bombardment by Saudi Arabian jets supplemented by British guidance.The UK has also been more involved in the latest US military operations than any other European country. The bulk of the US strikes have been launched from USS Harry S Truman in the Red Sea, but additional strikes were carried out by USAF B-2 bombers operating from Diego Garcia, the UK base in the Indian Ocean leased to the US.More than 750 strikes have been authorised since the decision in mid-March to raise the level of bombardment.View image in fullscreenPeople assess the damage after strikes in Saada attributed by the Houthi rebels to the US.Photograph: Mohammed Huwais/AFP/Getty ImagesThe Houthis for their part claim to have downed seven US Reaper drones in less than six weeks at a cost of more than $200m to the Pentagon.The value of the US attacks on the Houthi leadership is disputed, with some claiming the movement would not be disrupted if its leader was assassinated. The Houthis are Zaydi Shia, a branch that believes that leadership should be limited to descendants of the prophet Muhammad and that leaders must fulfil specific criteria, including being recognised religious scholars.Writing recently in the Yemen Review, Maysaa Shuja Al-Deen, a senior researcher at Sana’a Center for Strategic Studies, argued: “Without a respected local Zaydi authority figure capable of mediating or guiding the transition, the dispute would likely remain unresolved without external intervention. In this situation, Iran’s role would be key. Its political and military backing for one of the rival factions could prove decisive in shaping the group’s future direction.”Explore more on these topicsYemenHouthisUS foreign policyMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Temperatures of 25-28C are likely across parts of Germany, France and southern Britain, especially later in the week, with high pressure bringing dry and sunny conditions.Far higher temperatures are expected acrossPakistanand parts of north-west India. An ongoing heatwave will nudge temperatures to 7C above normal until the end of the month across several regions including Punjab, Islamabad and Kashmir. A peak of 48-49C is likely across parts of the Sindh region, and the authorities have issued public warnings urging people to take precautionary measures against the extreme heat.A change in weather is predicted in Pakistan at the beginning of May, bringing some relief to those suffering from the heatwave. Moist air from the Arabian Sea is likely to raise humidity levels, triggering thunderstorms and heavy rainfall, with lightning, hail, dust storms and strong winds likely to create hazardous conditions.Meanwhile, severe storms could affect parts of the US early this week, particularly the upper midwest. Strong winds, tornadoes and large hail have been reported in recent days in areas including Texas and Colorado. The threat of severe weather will continue over the coming days and spread north-eastwards.As warm, moisture-laden air surges north across the Great Plains and into the midwest, it will interact with colder air to produce unstable atmospheric conditions. This is likely to trigger severe thunderstorms and an increasing chance of tornadoes.Damaging winds, heavy rain and large hail are also likely, with flash flooding possible in the stormiest areas. The storm risk will spread into the north-east before easing midweek.Explore more on these topicsEnvironmentWeather trackerWashington DCPakistanEuropeSouth and central AsiaExtreme heatanalysisShareReuse this content"

The exemption for milk-based drinks was included because of concerns about calcium consumption, particularly among children.However, the Treasury said young people only get 3.5% of their calcium intake from such drinks, meaning “it is also likely that the health benefits do not justify the harms from excess sugar”.“By bringing milk-based drinks and milk substitute drinks into the SDIL, the government would introduce a tax incentive for manufacturers of these drinks to build on existing progress and further reduce sugar in their recipes,” it said.The Institute of Economic Affairs, a rightwing free-market thinktank, expressed concerns about the cost to consumers of the proposed changes.Children’s sugar consumption halved since tax announcement, study findsRead more“The sugar tax has been such a dramatic failure that it should be repealed, not expanded,” said Christopher Snowdon, head of lifestyle economics at the institute.“Sugar taxes have never worked anywhere. What happened to Starmer’s promise to not raise taxes on working people?”The government consultation on the plans will run from Monday until 21 July.Explore more on these topicsFood & drink industryMilkFoodLabourUltra-processed foodsObesitynewsShareReuse this content"

In the UK, a criminal handed a prison sentence of one year or more can be defined as having committed a “serious crime”.Officials said the planned changes will mean that anyone convicted of a crime and placed on the sex offender register will be categorised as having convicted a “particularly serious crime”, regardless of the length of sentence they receive.Home Office sources have not said how many more foreign national offenders may be removed from the UK as a result of the change. The department has conducted an impact assessment on the new policy which is yet to be released.According toofficial statistics, there were 451 foreign nationals serving sentences of less than 12 months in England and Wales at the end of March. There is no breakdown showing how many of those are sex offenders.Offenders who face removal could still attempt to claim a right to remain in the UK under the European convention on human rights, sources indicated. The new rule will also apply to foreign offenders who were convicted of sex offences abroad.Steve Valdez-Symonds, the programme director for refugee and migrant rights at Amnesty International UK, said the development was “an irresponsible approach to lawmaking that has long plagued immigration policy”.He added: “Rushing through late-stage amendments to major legislation means laws are made without the full scrutiny and care they demand. It risks creating injustice and dysfunction.“Excluding individuals from refugee protections without a proper, individualised assessment undermines fairness, hinders integration, and condemns people to live in limbo, unable to move forward with their lives.”The Home Office will also direct courts to reduce the time they take to consider appeals from asylum seekers in accommodation.The amendment will also set a 24-week target for first-tier immigration tribunals to decide on the appeals of those living in asylum seeker supported accommodation, or who are foreign national offenders, in a bid to cut the asylum backlog.Artificial intelligence will be used to support those processing asylum claims, the Home Office said, such as by summarising interview transcripts and accessing country advice. Using the technology could save case workers up to an hour per case, according to the department.Enver Solomon, the chief executive of the Refugee Council, welcomed efforts to speed up the appeals process, but said that extra funding would be required to make it work.He said: “A faster appeals process cannot be magicked up out of thin air and must not come at the cost of people’s access to justice. Previous efforts to speed up this process have often led to a bigger court backlog due to poor quality initial decisions.“The use of AI therefore must be carefully considered before potentially life or death decisions become a testing ground for the technology,” he said.Reform is on course to take hundreds of council seats and is ahead in the race for two metro mayoralties – Lincolnshire and Hull – as well as the Runcorn byelection, a constituency which Starmer has not yet visited.While much of the focus has been on the Tory response to the Farage threat, with Kemi Badenoch’s party expected to suffer a devastating night on Thursday, Labour insiders are also anxious about how they will perform against Reform in their post-industrial heartlands.There is some alarm on the backbenches over the government’s response to date, with MPs fearing the party’s position on issues is reached as a result of electoral considerations – such as migration, Europe and social issues.“We need to be careful about lurching to the right in response to Reform,” one MP said. “We can do better than that. We should be arguing for Labour values especially on immigration. If we want economic growth, legal migration has to play a part in that.”The number of migrants who have arrived in the UK after crossing the Channel this year has edged closer to 10,000, at the start of what is forecast to be the warmest week of 2025 so far.It emerged last year thata man who had carried out a chemical attack in Clapham, south London, had been granted asylum despite being a convicted sex offender and on the sex offender register.Abdul Ezedi, who doused his former girlfriend in alkaline before taking his own life, was granted asylum in 2020 by a judge who accepted that he was a Christian convert.He had been given a suspended sentence at Newcastle crown court on 9 January 2018 after pleading guilty to sexual assault and exposure and had been placed on the sex offender register for 10 years.Explore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumSex offenders registerLocal electionsReform UKLabourLocal politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

One concrete thing is that the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) have been involved in pushing for the Open to return to Trump-owned Turnberry.”Both the DCMS and Trump Turnberry declined to comment.Two other people briefed on conversations between the US president and Keir Starmer said Trump had asked the prime minister multiple times about hosting the Open at Turnberry, which the Trump Organization has owned since 2014.Trump has previously lobbied publicly to host the Open at the Ayrshire course, saying in 2023: “Everybody wants to see the Open championship here.”King Charles acknowledged the course’s importance to Trump whenhe wrote to him offering a visit to one of his Scottish estatesshould the president already be in the country visiting Turnberry.Hosting the Open could provide a welcome financial boost for SLC Turnberry, the course’s operating company, which is run by the president’s sons, Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. Last year the company lost £1.7m, having made £571,000 in the previous year – its only profit in 10 years.The R&A has a list of nine or 10 historic courses it would consider for hosting the Open, including famous venues such as St Andrews and Royal Birkdale. Turnberry is on that list, having hosted the championship in 2009. However golf experts point out that the event has grown substantially since then. While the 2009 Open attracted 123,000 people, the event at Royal Troon last year was attended by over 250,000.The R&A previously said it would not host the tournament at Turnberry in the wake of the January 6 attack by Trump supporters on the Capitol in 2021. Last November, the then head of the organisation, said he did not want “media noise” detracting from the game.Since then however the R&A has changed leadership. And in an apparent shift of position Mark Darbon, the new chief executive,said last weekhe would like to see the championship return to Turnberry “at some point”.Those briefed on the discussions between government officials and the R&A say they have mainly focused on the logistical challenges to hosting the Open at Turnberry. They said the main problems would be getting the sheer number of spectators in and out of the site by road, rail and air, given Turnberry is a two-and-a-half hour train trip from Glasgow, or a one-hour drive along a single A-road.Darbon said last week: “At Turnberry, there are definitely some logistical and commercial challenges that we face around the road, rail and accommodation infrastructure. We’re doing some feasibility work around what it would look like to return to that venue and the investment that it would require.”One ministertold the Financial Times earlier this yearthe venue would need “tens, or hundreds, of millions of pounds of investment” to make it easier to reach and to provide enough high-quality hotel accommodation in the area.A spokesperson for R&A said: “We regularly engage with government and local government regarding venues. We have explained the logistical challenges around Turnberry to the government and they are aware of the position.”Explore more on these topicsThe OpenDonald TrumpGolfLobbyingCivil serviceForeign policyScotlandnewsShareReuse this content"

That has now been seriously undermined as the retailer scrambles to deal with disruption caused by a massive cyber-attack it first revealed a week ago.At a time when M&S – alongside most big retailers – are pushing more automation on its customers and workers, industry insiders say the retailer’s staff have been forced to return to pens, paper and clipboards to check stock in stores as internal systems have been put on hold.Every second counts now, for M&S’s bottom line and for its reputation. Shoppers report problems with the use of gift cards in stores while thousands of orders made on or after 23 April have been cancelled. On Monday,it emerged that the difficulties were now affecting Ocado,as M&S’s deliveries of a small number of packaged foods to the online specialist it co-owns, were hit.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

On Thursday, those systems mostly restarted but M&S halted all orders on its website – which accounts for just over a third of clothing and homewares sales – amounting to almost £3.8m a day.As Patrick O’Brien, a retail analyst at GlobalData, says, cyber-attacks can have major consequences for businesses. “This is one of the most damaging cyber-attacks on a major UK retailer we have seen, the worst since Carpetright last year, which tipped an already very weak retailer into administration,” he says.M&S is a much stronger and larger business than Carpetright and not likely to be at risk of collapse, but the attack is having a direct impact on sales and as O’Brien says, the longer the disruption goes on, the more likely customers are to take their money elsewhere.M&S cyber-attack: when will orders be back, and is my data at risk?Read moreWhile most of the problems did not start until the later part of the Easter bank holiday, according to M&S, the attack cut off a run of buoyant trading. What M&S says was a separate incident also affected contactless payments in stores on the Saturday before Easter.Before then, sales had jumped almost 9% in the three months to 30 March, according to industry analysts Kantar, well above the wider fashion industry, as it continued to win over shoppers.M&S may derive some comfort from the fact that this is not happening during a peak trading period such as before Easter or Christmas, and Clive Black, M&S’s house broker at Shore Capital, said he expected the retailer to recoup any losses resulting from the attack via insurance.“The financial impact will be a zero sum game,” he says. “I don’t believe there will be enduring damage unless they don’t manage to fix it.”“There will be Mr & Mrs Angry from Tunbridge Wells but most people can see in the past decade that M&S has materially improved as a business and there will be some sympathy. This is not something it brought on itself but a malevolent force.”O’Brien agrees: “Customers are surprisingly forgiving.”Explore more on these topicsMarks & SpencerRetail industryCybercrimeanalysisShareReuse this content"

M&S did not confirm the number of items affected but said it had worked with Ocado and its suppliers “to minimise any disruption to the small proportion of the range delivered through our network to Ocado”.The disruption caused by the hack – and uncertainty over when it will end – has wiped more than £500m off the stock market value of M&S in the past week as experts said it had clearly suffered a cyber-attack on a huge scale.Vodafone whistleblowers warned executives about plight of high street store staffRead moreThe company has apologised to shoppers for the “inconvenience” caused by the attack, which will hit its online clothing and homeware sales amounting to almost £3.8m a day on average.On Monday, the retailer told 200 agency staff at its main distribution centre for its clothing and homewares at Castle Donington in Leicestershire to stay at home as orders on M&S.com remained on hold for the fourth day in a row, as first reported bySky News.Shoppers are still able to browse online and shop in M&S’s physical stores using cash or cards, but some difficulties continue in stores with gift cards not currently being accepted. Returning goods is only possible at tills in clothing and homeware stores or via post. Food stores are not currently able to accept returns.However, the company said shoppers did not need to take any action – suggesting no customer data had been accessed.M&S has hired cybersecurity experts to help investigate and manage the problem and said it was taking actions to further protect the network to ensure it could continue serving shoppers.It has limited access to its systems via its virtual private network for staff working from home to try to stop the spread of the attack, the Sunday Times reported.Clothing suppliers told the Guardian they had not been asked to pause deliveries as yet but feared this could be the case if online orders were paused for another week or more.“If it is not resolved by the end of this week it is going to become an issue,” one said.He said the difficulties came at a time that “sales are going exceptionally well in stores and things are looking fantastic”. May was likely to be a “huge month” for some clothing products given the burst of warm weather, which has kickstarted demand for summer gear and before the wedding and school proms season.The retail website closure came after several days of problems in stores where contactless payments and the collection of online orders were hit from Monday.Contactless paymentswere restarted late on Thursday.A separate technical problem on the Saturday of the busy Easter weekend affected only contactless payments.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Staff were brilliant,” one shopper wrote on Facebook.Another said: “I returned an online order in store yesterday but it’s not showing on my account.”M&S told shoppers on social media that orders placed after Wednesday 23 April would be refunded. Those expecting to pick up online orders in stores this week that had been placed before Wednesday were told to wait for a “ready to collect” notification email before heading to a store. It admitted to additional difficulties for those who had ordered party food, including wedding cakes, with some orders cancelled while notification emails were not always working even if orders were arriving in stores.Security experts warned shoppers to watch out for scammers capitalising on the high-profile incident.Kate Calvert, an analyst at Investec, said the longer it took for online sales to resume, the worse the hit would be for M&S. “There will be a short-term profit impact without a doubt,” she said.M&S said in January that ithad rung up strong sales over the Christmas period.

Fund, looked at 632 food products marketed towards babies and toddlers under three.It found that 41% of main meals marketed for children had sugar levels that were too high and that 21% of ready-to-eat fruit products, cereals and meals were too watery and not providing adequate nutrition.Ultra-processed babies: are toddler snacks one of the great food scandals of our time?Read moreIt also discovered that many early weaning foods were being sold as being suitable for babies aged four months, which goes against NHS and World Health Organization guidance.The study also found that a quarter of the products analysed were so high in sugar they would require a sugar warning label on the front of the pack, in accordance with WHO guidelines. According to NHS guidelines, babies aged one should have no more than 10g of sugar per day, and no more than 14g per day for children aged two and three.The sugar recommendation is applicable to naturally occurring free sugars and added sugars.The report also surveyed more than 1,000 parents. It found that 70% of parents agreed that high sugar baby foods should have front-of-pack warning labels, while 59% were concerned about the high levels of naturally occurring sugars in food.Dr Diane Threapleton, the lead author of the study, said: “Voluntary guidelines are often ineffective, and so regulation is needed to make sure that change happens.“With around 1.7 million children between six and 36 months in the UK, baby food is a massive market. Widespread availability of inappropriate products with poor nutritional quality will negatively impact child growth and development.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Stronger, mandatory baby food regulations are long overdue.”Sue Davies, the head of food policy at Which?, said: “The government urgently needs to update the out-of-date laws for commercial baby foods to ensure there are tighter controls on their composition – including limits on their sugar and salt content – make labelling clear and upfront and clamp down on any misleading marketing claims that suggest products are healthier than they really are.”A spokesperson for Ella’s Kitchen said: “There is nothing misleading about the name of this product. It follows strict legislation on how foods must be named, and clearly reflects exactly what is in the pouch – pears, peach and baby rice – in order of quantity.“Our ‘no added sugar’ claim is legally approved – and absolutely accurate. We never add sugar to our weaning products; all the sweetness comes naturally from the fruit and veg we use to make them.”A spokesman for Kraft Heinz said: “We’re proud of the role we play in families’ lives and remain committed to the health and wellbeing of infants and young children. We provide quality products based on nutrition science that meet the nutrient requirements specific to this life stage and adhere to stringent UK/EU regulation.“Our convenient, resealable pouches, made from natural ingredients with no added sugars, should be used as a complementary part of a varied weaning diet (six+ months) and are designed to be squeezed into a bowl or straight on to a spoon – as communicated on pack.”A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said:“Existing laws already set nutrition needs for baby foods, and we support enforcement against any product that does not meet these expectations.”Explore more on these topicsChildrenNutritionSugarHealth & wellbeingFoodnewsShareReuse this content"

It directs the attorney general to provide resources to the legal defense of police officers who “unjustly incur expenses and liabilities for actions taken during the performance of their official duties to enforce the law”. The order also includes a directive to “[hold] state and local officials accountable” for “willfully and unlawfully [directing] the obstruction of criminal law.”The second order targets so-called “sanctuary cities”, and directs the attorney general and secretary of homeland security to publish a list of state and local jurisdictions that “obstruct the enforcement of federal immigration laws”. It also calls on the government to identify federal funds that can be terminated as a consequence for cities that identify as sanctuary jurisdictions.Trump also signed an order on Monday requiring commercial vehicle drivers, such as truckers, read and speak English.The new executive orders come less than a weekafter a federal judge ruledthat the Trump administration cannot withhold federal funding from cities and counties that have passed laws preventing or limiting cooperation with US immigration officials, considered “sanctuary cities”.Trump can’t withhold funds from sanctuary cities, says federal judgeRead moreOn his first day in office in January, Trumpissued an orderdirecting the attorney general and homeland security secretary to withhold federal funds from such jurisdictions as part of his administration’s crackdown on immigration.In February, he also issuedanother orderinstructing the federal government to ensure that federal funding to state and local governments does not “abet so-called ‘sanctuary’ policies that seek to shield illegal aliens from deportation”.In response, San Francisco, along with more than a dozen other cities and counties nationwide with “sanctuary” policies, challenged the orders.According toWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, the orders signed on Monday will bring the total number of executive orders signed during Trump’s first 100 days in office to more than 140, nearing the total number signed by Joe Biden over his four-year term.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationUS immigrationUS politicsDonald TrumpUS policingnewsShareReuse this content"

The report attempts to put a number to Musk’s many conflicts of interest through his work with his so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge), warning that he may seek to use his influence to avoid legal liability.The report, which waspublished on Mondayby Democratic members of the Senate homeland security committee’s permanent subcommittee on investigations, looked at 65 actual or potential actions against Musk across 11 separate agencies. Investigators calculated the financial liabilities Musk and his companies, such as Tesla, SpaceX and Neuralink, may face in 45 of those actions.US senator introduces conflict of interest bill aimed at Elon MuskRead moreSince Donald Trump won re-election last year and Musk took on the role of de facto head ofDogein January, ethics watchdogs and Democratic officials have warned that the Tesla CEO could use his power to oust regulators and quash investigations into his companies. In the role, Musk, the richest man in the world, holds sway over agencies that regulate or contract with his companies. The subcommittee report outlines the extent of Musk’s liabilities, which include potentially facing $1.19bn in fines to Tesla alone over allegations it made false or misleading statements about its autopilot and self-driving features.Although the report gives a total estimated amount, it also states that the $2bn-plus figure does not include how much Musk could avoid from investigations that the Trump administration declines to launch. It also excludes the potential contracts, such ascommunications dealswith his Starlink satellite internet service, that Musk’s companies could gain because of his role in the administration.“While the $2.37 billion figure represents a credible, conservative estimate, it drastically understates the true benefit Mr Musk may gain from legal risk avoidance alone as a result of his position in government,” the report states.TheTrump administrationhas downplayed concerns over Musk’s conflicts of interest in recent months, with the White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, stating in early February that he would “excuse himself” if there was any issue. Democrats havepressed the administration for answerson how Musk is addressing these conflicts, while also seeking to put theincreasingly unpopular billionaireat the forefront of their attacks against the Trump administration. The Democratic senator Jeanne Shaheen introduced a bill earlier this month targeting Musk that would prohibit awarding government contracts to companies owned by special government employees.“Despite numerous requests from members of Congress, the Trump Administration has failed to provide any relevant documents or information, the authorities relied upon for these actions, or an explanation of how Mr Musk is navigating the conflicts they inherently pose,” the report states.Musk’s conflicts span multiple agencies, including the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) which oversees SpaceX rocket launches and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), which has multiple open investigations into Tesla’s operations. In February, Dogefired workersat the NHTSA that were experts in self-driving car technology.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The subcommittee’s report issues a series of demands to Trump, executive departments and regulatory agencies to take stronger oversight action against Musk, including allowing for independent audits of major contracts given to Musk-affiliated companies.“No one individual, no matter how prominent or wealthy, is above the law,” the report states in its conclusion. “Anything less than decisive, immediate, and collective action risks America becoming a bystander to the surrender to modern oligarchy.”Explore more on these topicsElon MuskUS politicsDogeTrump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

As screenwriter, he is also known for The Bourne Legacy and Kong: Skull Island. Most recently, he has also written multiple episodes of the acclaimed Star Wars series Andor.The original show ran from 1984 to 1990 and starred Don Johnson and Philip M Thomas as leads. It was executive-produced by Michael Mann who later relaunched it on the big screen with Colin Farrell and Jamie Foxx.‘I wish I’d never written that damn movie’: Rust director Joel Souza on finishing his film after the fatal on-set shootingRead moreThe 2006 film made $164m worldwide from a $135m budget and initial mixed reviews soon turned into a stronger re-appreciation in the subsequent years. “It is operatic and grandiose – but gripping and exhilarating in a way no other film-maker could manage,” the Guardian’s Peter Bradshawwrote.Farrell later spoke negatively about the film in an interview with Total Film. “I didn’t like it so much – I thought it was style over substance and I accept a good bit of the responsibility,” he said. “It was never going to be Lethal Weapon, but I think we missed an opportunity to have a friendship that also had some elements of fun.”Kosinski made his feature film debut with 2010’s Tron: Legacy and went on to direct the sci-fi adventure Oblivion and firefighter drama Only the Brave before making the smash hit Top Gun sequel which made $1.4bn worldwide.This summer sees the release of his Brad Pitt-starring action drama F1 and he was also recently attached to a UFO conspiracy thriller which he is set to make for Apple.Explore more on these topicsFilmUS televisionCrime filmsTelevisionnewsShareReuse this content"

Separate figures reported by the Financial Times from Vizion, a data provider, show container bookings from China to the US fell 45% by mid-April compared with a year earlier.UK banks brace for first-quarter reports after Trump tariff turmoilRead moreEconomists have warned that Trump’s trade battles will lead to a significant slowdown in global trade and come with a cost for US consumers by pushing up prices and raising the chances of a recession. Washington has imposed a 145% tariff on Chinese imports and a blanket 10% border tax on all other countries, barring some exemptions.Over the weekend, the US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, suggested there was apotential “path” to a deal with Chinaon tariffs after speaking with his Chinese counterparts on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank spring meetings.Analysis by the US private equity group Apollo Global Management showed new business orders have fallen sharply since Trump’s “liberation day”announcementon 2 April.Torsten Sløk, the asset manager’s chief economist, said: “For companies, new orders are falling, capex [investment] plans are declining, inventories were rising before tariffs took effect, and firms are revising down earnings expectations.“For households, consumer confidence is at record-low levels, consumers were front loading purchases before tariffs began, and tourism is slowing, in particular international travel.”Growing numbers of US company chief executives have voiced alarm at the impact from Trump’s tariff policies. The bosses of Walmart and Target, two of the country’s largest retailers, have warned the president that his plans could disrupt supply chains, raise prices and lead to empty shelves.Analysts said the latest shipping figures, which are updated on a daily basis, indicated the fallout was escalating. However, some of the decline will also be down to a lull in activity after US companies rushed to import goods before Trump’s inauguration in anticipation of his tariff policies.The US trade deficit widened to arecord high in Januaryas companies front-loaded imports before tariffs were imposed.Kathleen Brooks, the research director at the trading platform XTB, said: “Already, port authorities in the US and logistics firms are expecting Chinese shipments to fall sharply.“Demand for goods from China has plummeted since mid-April, suggesting that US businesses have been quick to adjust to the tariffs.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, the vice head of China’s state planner, Zhao Chenxin, said on Monday he was “fully confident” that the world’s second-largest economy would achieve its economic growth target of about 5% for 2025.The San Pedro Bay ports of LA and Long Beach handle almost a third of all containerised seaborne trade in the US, and act as the main gateway for goods from China. As the busiest port in the western hemisphere, cars, computers and smartphones are the top imports to the port of LA.Highlighting that it typically takes between 20 and 40 days for a sea container to travel from China to the US, Sløk said there would be a knock-on impact on demand for US trucking from the middle of next month, which could lead to empty shelves and layoffs in the distribution and retail industries.This could lead to a recession by the summer, he added.Paul Krugman, the US Nobel-winning economist, said the collapse in trade was “reminiscent of what happened during and after the Covid pandemic” amid growing uncertainty for companies over the president’s policies.“But this time a virus won’t be responsible. It will all be about Donald Trump,” he wrote on Substack. “This time there won’t be a vaccine coming to our rescue.

But jobs in the EV industry could be affected by Trump’s war on clean energyKavitha Cardoza in Kansas CityMon 28 Apr 2025 07.00 EDTShareIn aKansasCity classroom, 20 students were learning how basic circuit boards work. They fiddled with knobs, switches, levers and wires; if they got the connections right, tiny light bulbs glowed.The students, recruited for the opportunity by Panasonic, were participants in an eight-week apprenticeship course that involved classes at the community college and on-the-job training. When they’re done, they will be among the first workers at the company’s new electric vehicle battery factory in nearby De Soto,Kansas. The $4bn manufacturing plant – touted as thelargest EV battery factory in the world– is expected to open in early summer and eventually employ roughly 4,000 people. Panasonic also paid for the students’ tuition, as well as the instructor’s salary.Apprenticeship programs like this one have been heralded as the future of workforce development. Born out of partnerships between industry and community colleges, these short-term programs offer credentials closely aligned with employer needs and are often referred to as the pathway to high-skill, high-demand, high-wage jobs. In this case, Panasonic and two Kansas colleges created theirs in a matter of months, adapting an existing curriculum to meet factory demand.“We’re helping them build their workforce from the very beginning,” said Greg Mosier, the president of Kansas City Kansas Community College (KCKCC).During the Biden administration, the federal government invested billions of dollars to help build and expand domestic electric vehicle and battery production.But theTrump administrationhas thrown this career pathway into uncertainty. On his first day in office,Donald Trumpsignedan executive orderthat scrapped a Biden administration goal that half of all new cars sold in the US by 2030 be electric; called for the elimination of tax credits for the vehicles; and pushed to undo regulations around pollution and fuel economy standards. Trump also paused federal funding to build electric vehicle chargers,ordered thousands of stations disconnected at government sitesand tried to freeze spending on clean energy projects.View image in fullscreenOne-semester Automation Engineer Technology students create electrical circuits in a lab at the Kansas City Kansas Community College Technical Education Center.Photograph: Zac Clingenpeel for The Hechinger ReportA Princetonanalysissaid these changes would wipe out demand for new electric vehicle manufacturing in the United States, causing electric vehicle battery sales to drop by about 40% by 2030 and putting half of the existing plants at risk of closure. In the final quarter of 2024, EVsmade up more than 8%of all vehicle sales.After initially agreeing to let a reporter access the classes it started at KCKCC and talk with students, instructors and a Panasonic representative canceled that offer without explanation, and did not respond to subsequent interview requests.Few state leaders were willing to speak about how the federal policy changes would affect community colleges and businesses in the state. Kansas governor Laura Kelly, a Democrat, declined to comment. Representative Sharice Davids, a Democrat who represents the congressional district where the Panasonic facility is being built, called Trump’s decision to roll back tax credits “harmful”. In a statement to the Hechinger Report, she said the president’s executive orders “throw uncertainty into the mix, not just for Panasonic but for every worker, supplier, and small business that stands to benefit”.In recent years, community colleges have led the charge to build a skilled workforce for electric car companies and their suppliers, for jobs that often require some postsecondary education but not a four-year degree.Pima Community College in Arizona,Richland Community College in Illinois,Wake Technical Community College in North CarolinaandRio Hondo College in Californiaare among the institutions that have started such programs.The American Association of Community Colleges (AACC) operates an Electric Vehicles Hub – in partnership with Tesla and Panasonic and funded with $8m in federal dollars – that helps colleges share best practices and track student outcomes. There are a limited number of qualified instructors for these programs, and they require specialized equipment and computer programs that are expensive, said Martha Parham, who heads communications for the community college association. The KCKCC program’s lab, with its specialized computer programs and equipment, cost $5m.View image in fullscreenGreg Mosier, the president of Kansas City Kansas Community College, stands outside the school’s career and technical education center.Photograph: Zac Clingenpeel for The Hechinger ReportKCKCC took an existing two-year curriculum in advanced manufacturing and initially created a 16-week course that included both classroom instruction and practical training. But Panasonic couldn’t wait that long, said Mosier: “To ramp up, they really needed to get people going at a faster rate.”So the college, along with another local college, Johnson County Community College (JCCC), worked with Panasonic to understand exactly which employee skills it needed immediately and then shortened the course to eight weeks – effectively doubling the number of students who could participate. KCKCC and JCCC plan to cycle a combined 200 students through this entry-level course each year. The starting salary is expected to be more than $50,000.JCCC, whose program will begin in June, is working to train Panasonic supervisors as instructors, who will then transition as supervisors when the class moves to the factory floor. “So they will have a familiar face and someone who understands their skill set,” said L Michael McCloud, the provost. The credentials are also stackable, meaning they will count toward a two-year associate degree at both colleges. In addition, JCCC developed an agreement with Kansas State University to recognize the credentials as part of a bachelor’s degree in engineering technology.Panasonic also sponsors students in other KCKCC classes, including an associate degree class in automation engineering. Justin Jefferson, a student in that class, said he signed up too late to secure one of the Panasonic spots, about half the class. Still, he is determined to work at the company once he graduates: “Panasonic is preparing for the future,” he said.View image in fullscreenAC/DC Electrical systems sit on tables in a lab at the Kansas City Kansas Community College Technical Education Center.Photograph: Zac Clingenpeel for The Hechinger ReportJefferson, 38, has held several jobs over the years, including as a butcher and as a health aide; now, more than anything, he wants stability. “That way I won’t have to deal with the stress of not having enough or just having enough,” he said. His classmates range in age from recent high school graduates to career switchers in their 50s.McCloud said staff have been fielding calls daily from people asking about Panasonic offerings. Local school district superintendents have reached out too, he said, to learn how their students can get a leg up in applying for Panasonic jobs.Although community colleges have not been the focus of Trump’s cuts to and attacks on higher education institutions, they are potentially vulnerable. During the 2022-23 school year, nearly 15% of community college budgetscame fromfederal sources. In addition, 48% of the roughly 10.5 million community college students in 2020 received some sort of federal aid.At her confirmation, Trump’s education secretary, Linda McMahon, said she supports expanding postsecondary education and training pathways, including apprenticeships. At the same time, though, the Trump administration has canceled some grants for apprenticeship programs and research projects and terminated theadvisory committee on apprenticeship. The labor and of education departments did not respond to interview requests.On a weekday in February, the site of the sprawling new Panasonic facility in downtown De Soto was abuzz with activity. It sits on the former Sunflower Army Ammunition Plant, abandoned since the early 1990s. “There was a lot of blight,” said Rick Walker, the part-time mayor of De Soto, a community of 6,500. Residents worried about what would become of the site, Walker recalled. “Was it just going to be this zombie wasteland forever?”Today, construction workers, cranes and cement trucks crowd the nearly 5m sq ftf building site. At lunchtime, a nearby Mexican restaurant was packed with some of the 3,300 workers hired to build the plant. Four new eateries have opened. A struggling grocery store is busy again. New apartment units are fully occupied. Since Panasonic arrived, the town has had a 130% increase in sales tax revenue, which has allowed city leaders to cut property taxes by a third, said Walker.View image in fullscreenA lot lies under construction in downtown Kansas City, Kansas, on 4 February.Photograph: Zac Clingenpeel for The Hechinger ReportGreg LeRoy, the executive director of Good Jobs First, a watchdog group that tracks corporate subsidies, points out that there isa lot of public moneyat stake. To attract the company, the Kansas Legislature created an incentive program awarding Panasonic more than $829m in tax credits, payroll reimbursement, workforce training and sales tax exemptions on construction materials. It’s also eligible for federal corporate income tax credits, which he estimated at $6.8bn. LeRoy said the public money is tied to output, which is less certain because of the federal policy shift. “If they don’t produce, they’re not going to get the credits,” he said.Local governments in Kansas are shouldering the greatest risk, he said, because they’ve had to spend millions of dollars up front – preparing land for development, building and widening roads, and installing new utility hookups. “They had to build an entire new fire station because this plant has special fire risks associated with it,” he said. As a cautionary tale, LeRoy cited FoxConn, whose much-touted Wisconsin factoryremains largely undeveloped, costing local governments about $300m in land rights, water mains, roads, eminent domain purchases and other expenses.Walker, the De Soto mayor, said his city has put in $2m to date, to widen roads, which leveraged an additional $60m in state funds. “Even if Panasonic shuttered their doors before they open, we’re not going to go bankrupt,” he said. The company has funded much of the infrastructure work through a Tax Increment Financing district designation, he said, which freezes taxes at a pre-development level and diverts future tax revenue for infrastructure improvements. Panasonic is occupying just 300 acres of the 9,000-acre (3,600-hectare) site, Walker said, and he hopes the infrastructure improvements will attract other companies.If the demand for electric vehicles falls, it could lead to less investment in training, fewer jobs and poorer economic prospects for states like Kansas. But many people here in this region, which voted decisively for Trump in 2016, 2020 and 2024, didn’t seem concerned as yet. Especially in the Kansas City area, “EVs are here to stay” was a common refrain.Walker, who is also an engineer, said he said he was “distressed” to read about the federal government’s decision to move away from battery-operated cars. “Electric cars are much more efficient, it’s not just about the environment,” he said. Still, he believes the adoption of electric vehicles is inevitable. “While the demand or sales may be slower, I don’t see that flatlining or reversing.”JCCC’s McCloud acknowledged the fear, but said he hasn’t heard “any broad concerns about the viability of the factory”. He added: “While this plant is designed around batteries that would function for electric vehicles, it’s my understanding that those power sources will possibly also be useful in other ways.” Mosier from KCKCC, said he didn’t think a “couple of actions at the federal level” would shut efforts down.Jefferson, the KCKCC student, also remains optimistic about the long-term prospects of the EV battery factory and his potential future in it. “You know you read stories about people who worked at General Motors for 20 or 30 years and do OK?” he said. “That’s my goal.”Thisstory about apprenticeshipswas produced bythe Hechinger Report, a non-profit, independent news organization focused on inequality and innovation in education.

NLRB field staffing hasdeclinedby one-third in the last decade, while case intake per employee at the agency grew by 46%.“The harm to America’s workers by potential directives to reduce this independent agency’s workforce cannot be overstated,” the letter added. “Any NLRB reduction in force (RIF) or office closures would be catastrophic for workers’ rights.”The representatives also requested all information related to Doge’s role at the NLRB, including all communications Doge had with employees at the NLRB or regarding the NLRB with other agencies.Dismissed labor official sues Trump and NLRB chair over firingRead moreDoge is led by billionaire Trump donorElon Musk.

The report noted that in the pandemic’s wake, a lack of microchips for German carmakers caused production to collapse to 1975 levels.“They are present in everything, and are becoming only more so with time,” Turtelboom said. “In a modern car, there are about 1,500 microchips. By 2030, this number is expected to rise to 3,000.”Brussels announced a Chips Act in 2022 to reduce the EU’s reliance on foreign states for supplies of critical components. The resulting regulation came into force in 2023.“Is it worrying? We know that other continents, China, the US, Taiwan and South Korea, they are not sitting still,” Turtelboom added.China is expected to overtake Taiwan as the world’s biggest manufacturer of chips in 2030 with 22% of the market, according to the ECA. The EU is forecast to manufacture just 8% on its own soil by then, and would have to quadruple its production capacity to meet a 20% target.The ECA found that the Chips Act did provide “new impetus” to manufacturing, and that the funding provided by the European Commission was aligned to the bloc’s strategy.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It added that tax breaks needed to be closely monitored with a view to increasing investment.The EU’s ambition when the Chips Act came into force was to mobilise €86bn (£73bn) in investment by 2030, but this is eclipsed by the sums being spent by the likes of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), Samsung and Intel.These top players budgeted $425bn (£361bn) for investment in just three years between 2020 and 2023 and only one, TSMC, had significant plans to invest in the EU.Intel, which already has manufacturing facilities in Ireland, had planned to pour €30bn into a mega plant in Magdeburg, Germany, with backing of almost €10bn from the German government, but postponed construction last September.The postponement was a big blow to the EU that highlighted the effects of the sector being concentrated in so few hands.“There are a limited amount of players who receive a lot of funding, which means if one project drops, it has a huge impact on the 20% targets,” Turtleboom said.A European Commission spokesperson said the Chips Act had catalysed funding of €80bn and “laid a strong foundation in consolidating Europe’s position in the global semiconductor market after two decades of decline, and put Europe back on the path of growth”.Explore more on these topicsTechnology sectorEuropean UnionEuropeArtificial intelligence (AI)newsShareReuse this content"

It is Arsenal’s third appearance in the last four of Europe’s elite competition, after the victory against Villarreal in 2005-06 and the defeat by Manchester United in 2008-09.Luis Enrique urges PSG to ‘rewrite history’ against Arsenal in Champions LeagueRead moreArsenal were beaten byBarcelona in the 2005-06 finaland Arteta wants to harness the collective yearning for a first Champions League triumph, not to mention the connection he has built between the team and the fans. It underpinned the electric atmosphere at the Emirates Stadium for the 3-0 quarter-final first-legwin against Real Madrid, which set Arsenal up to progress5-1 on aggregate.“I tell them [the supporters], and I’m not exaggerating here: ‘Guys, bring your boots, bring your shorts, bring your T-shirts and let’s play every ball together,’” Arteta said. “We want to do something special. The place has to be something special, something that we haven’t seen. I really hope that everybody that comes to the Emirates and is watching and following us, brings that energy with them.“You feel it [the lack of aChampions Leaguetitle]. We have, fortunately, a lot of people that have worked in the club for many, many years and they’ve never been in this position [to win it]. So that tells you how unique and beautiful it is. We need to earn the right to be in that final and everything is going to start tomorrow. So yeah, we are making history. It’s a beautiful story right now but we want much more. We have to take the opportunity and make it happen.”Arteta refused to dwell on any negativity, unlike his PSG counterpart, Luis Enrique, who complained about his team’s treatment by the French media. PSG, who are in the Champions League semi-finals for a fourth time in six seasons, are also chasing a first triumph in the competition.Arteta is emboldened not only by how his team took Madrid apart butPSG’s struggles at Aston Villain the quarter-final, second-leg when theylost 3-2and only just progressed 5-4 on aggregate. Then, there was the manner of Arsenal’s 2-0 home win against PSG in the second round of ties in this season’s league phase. That night, it was Arsenal’s greater physicality, as much as anything else, that stood out.“You learn a lot from every game,” Arteta said. “Going to the Bernabéu is probably the biggest test that you can have as a European team. That brings confidence and experience to a team that most of us … we never had before.“I take a lot of things from the game we played here [against PSG]. It was very important for us because at the time, they were one of the best teams in Europe. To put yourself into that category, to that level and say: ‘Actually, we can compete and we can beat them.’ It was good preparation for what is coming right now.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The petition was filed in January by Jeffrey Lenkov, a Southern California lawyer who represented Rose prior to the 17-time All-Star’s death at age 83.Charlie Hustle: the definitive Pete Rose book that deconstructs a disgraced legendRead more“I met with President Trump two weeks ago, I guess now, and one of the topics was Pete Rose, but I’m not going beyond that,” Manfred said. “He’s said what he said publicly, I’m not going beyond that in terms of what the back and forth was.”Trump posted on social media in February that he plans to issue “a complete PARDON of Pete Rose.” Trump posted on Truth Social that Rose “shouldn’t have been gambling on baseball, but only bet on HIS TEAM WINNING.” It’s unclear what a presidential pardon might include – Trump did not specifically mention a tax case in which Rose pleaded guilty in 1990 to two counts of filing false tax returns and served a five-month prison sentence. The president said he would sign a pardon for Rose “over the next few weeks” but has not addressed the matter since.Rose had 4,256 hits and also holds records for games (3,562) and plate appearances (15,890). He was the 1973 National League MVP and played on three World Series winners.An investigation for MLB by lawyer John M Dowd found Rose placed numerous bets on the Cincinnati Reds to win from 1985-87 while playing for and managing the team.Rose agreed with MLB on a permanent ban in 1989.Lenkov is seeking Rose’s reinstatement so that he can be considered for the Hall of Fame. Under a rule adopted by the Hall’s board of directors in 1991, anyone on the permanently ineligible list can’t be considered for election to the Hall. Rose applied for reinstatement in 1997 and met with Commissioner Bud Selig in November 2002, but Selig never ruled on Rose’s request. Manfred in 2015 denied Rose’s application for reinstatement.Manfred said reinstating Rose now was “a little more complicated than it might appear on the outside” and did not commit to a timeline except that “I want to get it done promptly as soon as we get the work done. I’m not going to give this the pocket veto. I will in fact issue a ruling.”Rose’s reinstatement doesn’t mean he would automatically appear on a Hall of Fame ballot. He would first have to be nominated by the Hall’s Historical Overview Committee, which is picked by theBaseballWriters’ Association of America and approved by the Hall’s board. Manfred is an ex-officio member of that board and says he has been in regular contact with chairman Jane Forbes Clark.“I mean, believe me, a lot of Hall of Fame dialogue on this one,” Manfred said.If reinstated, Rose potentially would be eligible for consideration to be placed on a ballot to be considered by the 16-member Classic Baseball Era committee in December 2027.Manfred added he doesn’t think baseball’s current ties to legal sports betting should color views on Rose’s case.“There is and always has been a clear demarcation between what Rob Manfred, ordinary citizen, can do on the one hand, and what someone who has the privilege to play or work in Major League Baseball can do on the other in respect to gambling,” he said. “The fact that the law changed, and we sell data and/or sponsorships, which is essentially all we do, to sports betting enterprises, I don’t think changes that. It’s a privilege to play Major League Baseball. As with every privilege, there comes responsibilities. One of those responsibilities is that they not bet on the game.”Manfred did not go into details on his discussion with Trump over foreign-born players other than to say he expressed worry.“Given the number of foreign-born players we have, we’re always concerned about ingress and egress,” Manfred said. “We have had dialogue with the administration about this topic. And, you know, they’re very interested in sports. They understand the unique need to be able to go back and forth, and I’m going to leave it at that.”Explore more on these topicsMLBCincinnati RedsDonald TrumpUS politicsGamblingBaseballUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

That said, drafts do tell you a great deal about how NFL teams think about themselves at a particular point in time – what they need, where they’re lacking, and how they want it all to come together. Whether right or wrong in the end, there’s no more clear indicator of team philosophy than the annual three-day exercise, and that’s why it’s important beyond the players who are actually selected.While it will be years before we know how wise each move was in the 2025 draft, here are those who benefited most and least, as well as the decisions we feel are worthy of applause, and the ones that had us shaking our heads.WINNER: The Jacksonville JaguarsWhen the Jaguars moved up from the fifth overall pick to the second in a trade with theCleveland Brownsto select Colorado cornerback/receiver/unicorn Travis Hunter, they were making history in more ways than one. This marked the first time that a team moved up into the top five in a draft to select a non-quarterback since 1997, when the St Louis Rams moved up to take offensive tackle Orlando Pace, who wound up in the Hall of Fame. And if you consider Hunter more of a cornerback than a receiver, he became the highest-drafted player at that position in the NFL’s common draft era, which goes back to 1967.Travis Hunter wants to be the NFL’s Shohei Ohtani. Will anyone let him?Read moreThe Jaguars gave up their fifth overall pick in 2025, as well as their 36th and 126th picks in 2025, and their first-round pick in 2026 for the right to draft Hunter, and Cleveland’s 104th and 200th picks in 2025. Cleveland (more on them in a minute) tookMichigan defensive tackle Mason Grahamwith the fifth pick,Ohio State running back Quinshon Judkinswith the 36th, and Tennessee running back Dylan Sampson with the 126th. Good players all, which is important to a Browns team with multiple needs, and that extra 2026 pick could mean a lot in next year’s superior quarterback class.But for Cleveland, this trade only works if they hit big, because Hunteris unlike anyone we have seen before. Two-way football players of this magnitude have not existed since the days of Sammy Baugh and Chuck Bednarik – hence the comparisons to Shohei Ohtani and Victor Wembanyama.“Travis Hunter, he embodies belief,” Jaguars general manager James Gladstone said. “He’s a rare person. He’s a rare player. But he’s also a reminder that the boundaries of the game of football were built to be challenged. So, the decision to select him was actually a statement, a statement for how we plan to move, who we are, and we want him to be nothing more than him because, when he is, he elevates the space around him.”Hunter had a credible case as the best receiverandthe best cornerback in this draft class. If he is able to live up to his potential, Jacksonville won’t regret the price they paid.LOSER: The Atlanta FalconsThe Falcons’ need for pass-rushers on the edge was perhaps the most obvious in the entire draft, and the team went all out to fill it. Perhaps a bit too all-out. Atlanta selected Georgia’s Jalon Walker with the 15th overall pick, andWalker can rush the passer very wellfrom the defensive line and from linebacker depth. Then, the Falcons traded their 46th pick in the second round, their 242th pick in the seventh round, and their first-round pick in 2026 to move up to No 26 to select Tennessee pass-rusher James Pearce Jr.Pearce has been productive, with 23 sacks and 113 total pressures over three seasons with the Volunteers, per Pro Football Focus. But he is a bit of a one-trick pony at this point – if he can’t win with speed around the edge, he struggles to win at all, and one-trick ponies tend to struggle at any position in an NFL with more dimensional demands.The price the Falcons paid there was especially odd given what the New York Giants paid to trade up for the 25th selection one pick before what Atlanta did. For the rights to select Jaxson Dart, the Giants gave the 34th pick in the second round, the 99th pick in the fourth round, and a third-round pick in 2026 to the Houston Texans. That’s a more reasonable transaction, and now, the pressure is on Pearce to perform to a higher standard, through no fault of his own.That’s the football stuff, but the Falcons’ draft story got plain weird on Sunday night, when it emerged that the son of the team’s defensive coordinatorhad prank called Shedeur Sandersas the quarterback slid down the draft. Atlanta DC Jeff Ulbrich had apparently left his iPad lying around and his 21-year-old son, Jax, had copied Sanders’s number off the device.Jax’s friend then passed himself offas New Orleans Saints general manager Mickey Loomis on Friday to tell Sanders the team intended to take him with their next pick. After his part in the prank was revealed Jaxsaid his conduct had been“completely inexcusable, embarrassing, and shameful.” He also called Sanders for the second time in a few days, this time as himself. He did not say whether Sanders accepted his apology.View image in fullscreenDillon Gabriel was picked ahead of Shedeur Sanders by the Browns.Photograph: Soobum Im/Getty ImagesLOSER: Dillon Gabriel, QB, Cleveland BrownsFor about 24 hours,Oregon quarterback Dillon Gabrielthought that he had a good shot at the Browns’ starting job. Gabriel had earned that opportunity given the Browns’ dearth of hope at the position, with veterans Joe Flacco and Kenny Pickett in the room and Deshaun Watson out of the picture for 2025 through injury, not to mention the fact thatWatson’s tenure has been a disaster, on and off the field.The Browns selected Gabriel in the third round based on a 2024 season in which he proved to be one of the NCAA’s best quarterbacks under pressure and as a deep passer. If he wasn’t relatively small (5ft 11in and 205lb) and old (24) he might have been a first-round prospect. Regardless, Gabriel had, and may still have, a very good chance to become the Browns’ next franchise quarterback, and this is a team who have been trying to figure out that position since their rebirth in 1999.But, one day after Gabriel heard his name called,the Browns selected Sandersin the fifth round, and all hell broke loose. The media circus that has followed Sanders throughout his NCAA rise will unquestionably remain and expand in the NFL – as we have already seen with the prank call. This could be the most overcooked story for a quarterback based on coverage versus actual NFL achievement since Tim Tebow. Gabriel was just a guy trying to make his way in the league; now, he’ll be seen by most as a barrier to the story everyone will want to read.WINNER: Caleb Williams, QB, Chicago BearsThere were all kinds of questions about the future of the first overall pick in the 2024 draft after his rookie season, and few of them were Williams’ fault. The Bears cycled through three different offensive coordinators, the offensive line was a mess, and Williams didn’t even know what his coaches wanted him to do half the time.Fortunately for Williams, the franchise looked to reverse all the negatives this offseason. New head coach Ben Johnson is one of the best offensive minds in football, and free agency brought a new interior offensive line with left guard Joe Thuney, center Drew Dalman, and right guard Jonah Jackson.Then, in the first two rounds of the draft, the Bears gave Williams two new weapons who could be major factors right away. Michigan tight end Colston Loveland, the 10th overall pick in the first round, transcended a less-than-explosive Wolverines offense in 2024by making plays at all levels of the field. And Missouri receiver Luther Burden III, the 39th overall pick in the second round,gets the nuances of the positionin ways that amplify his physical attributes.None of this guarantees anything once they hit the field, of course, but it’s hard to find a quarterback who had a better offseason – and after that brutal rookie year, Williams deserved a better hand.View image in fullscreenJihaad Campbell has added depth to an already fearsome Eagles defense.Photograph: Matt Rourke/APWINNER: Howie Roseman, general manager, Philadelphia EaglesRoseman is going to be a winner in just about every article of this nature just about every year, because he’s just so good at understanding his own team’s needs, the ideal players to fill them, and the vagaries of the draft process.This year, Roseman started his draft by giving defensive coordinator Vic Fangio (quite possibly the best in the business) five straight additions, and all five could be immediate impact players.Alabama linebacker Jihaad Campbellgives Fangio a peerless athlete who can succeed at all three levels of the defense – were it not for a shoulder injury that may delay his NFL debut, Campbell would have been a lock in the top half of the first round; instead Philly got him with the 31st overall pick.Texas safety Andrew Mukubais one of the best pass defenders in the 2025 class, and Roseman stole him with the 64th pick in the second round.Fourth-round pick Ty Robinson, a defensive lineman from Nebraska, could be the ideal replacement for Milton Williams, who signed a massive free-agent contract with the New England Patriots this offseason.On and on it went.There wasn’t a single pick the Eagles madethat made you shake your head; more often, the thought was, ‘Oh, Howie did it again.” Other NFL executives are probably nervous when Roseman is on the other end of the line, because odds are, you’re about to get out-thought and out-foxed. If you want the primary reason the Eagles are the defending Super Bowl champions, you can start right there.LOSER: The 2025 quarterback classIt’s clear that the NFL didn’t think much of a quarterback class that was seen as far worse than the one from 2024. Last year, there were six quarterbacks selected in the first round – the top three picks (Caleb Williams, Jayden Daniels, Drake Maye), and the remaining three in the top 12 (Michael Penix Jr with the eighth pick, JJ McCarthy with the 10th pick, and Bo Nix with the 12th pick). That was a star-studded class, and outside McCarthy, whose preseason torn meniscus cost him the 2024 season, the entire class showed starting potential right away.This time around, just two quarterbacks – Miami’s Cam Ward first overall to the Tennessee Titans, and the aforementioned Dart with the 25th pick – were first-rounders. It’s a class far more like the group in 2022, when Pitt’s Kenny Pickett was the only first-rounder, and even that was a reach.That’s not to say none of these quarterbacks will succeed; after all, the best from the 2022 class was Brock Purdy, the final pick that year. But it’s fair to say this class faces a steeper hill to climb – and the league made that judgment clear on draft weekend.Explore more on these topicsNFLJacksonville JaguarsCleveland BrownsAtlanta FalconsChicago BearsPhiladelphia EaglesUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Nine times this season in the league, Arsenal have led in games that they have failed to win. On 13 occasions, Liverpool have improved their result in the second half (that is, turned a draw into a win, or a defeat into a draw or a win). It has not been a thrilling conclusion –they’ve wrapped the title upbefore the end of April with four games to spare and have looked probable champions for at least three months – but at least they had their day of celebration of Anfield.Premier League and FA Cup semis: 10 talking points from the weekendRead moreAnd because it was Tottenham, after the early blip of Dominic Solanke’s goal, there was a grand procession, a carnival of largely pressure-free attacking football, five goals including one for Mohamed Salah, a fitting way to round off what has been an excellent season for him personally. Liverpool lost the first leg of their Carabao Cup semi-final 1-0 to Spurs, but they have scored 15 against them in their other games this season. That in itself is telling of one of Liverpool’s great strengths. They may not press quite as aggressively and extravagantly as they did under Jürgen Klopp, but they press effectively nonetheless; Tottenham, who have spent most of the season almost pathologically playing out from the back despite having very little capacity to do so successful, are almost the perfect victims for them.Historically, this triumph matters because Liverpoolmove level with Manchester Unitedon 20 English league titles; Arsenal are seven behind them in third. If your tiebreaker is how often you have been second, United remain the most successful side in English history; if it’s total trophies won, it’s Liverpool. Such arguments, though, are perhaps best left to the darker corners of fan media. (20 league titles, compared with other leading leagues, is a relatively small tally – Real Madrid have 36, Juventus 36, Bayern 33 – as useful an indicator as any of how successful English football was for a long time in resisting a super-club elite).1:34Liverpool fans ecstatic after winning Premier League in Arne Slot's first season at club – videoMore interesting, perhaps, is that while United’s titles have come under just three managers, Liverpool’s have come under 10 (although that tally does include Matt McQueen, who took over from David Ashworth three months before the 1922-23 title was won). No other side has triumphed under so many; their success has been, if not exactly consistent since they claimed their first championship in 1900-01, then at least better spread than most. The 30 years they had to wait between their last title under Kenny Dalglish in 1989-90 and the Klopp title in 2019-20 represents their longest drought. English football may have remained equitable longer than most, but there has rarely been an age when Liverpool have not been challengers.How this title comes to be viewed probably depends on what happens next. On the one hand, very few managers have ever been handed a squad in quite such a good condition as the one Klopppassed on to Arne Slot, and yet at the same time there has been a growing awareness as the season has gone on that Liverpool’s squad needs strengthening in as many as five or six positions. Those are not contradictory statements, and to an extent the need for new blood is a result of Liverpool signing only one senior player last summer, but they do explain the slightly ambivalent feeling many seem to have towards this side. Is it the last great triumph of the Klopp era, with Slot as a latter-day Matt McQueen? Or is he more of a Bob Paisley, building on the great legacy of his predecessor?Either way, it has been a hugely impressive achievement. Nobody can claim the title race has been particularly exciting, but that is not to denigrate Liverpool. They have been very good and none of their rivals have been, and the result has been a largely uneventful march to the title. There was perhaps a slight wobble in recent weeks as fatigue began to bite and focus slip, but nobody else looked remotely equipped to take advantage.Had the title been sealed by Arsenal losing to Crystal Palace on Wednesday that would have been a damp squib but, in the end, it was won gloriously, on a sunny afternoon ofred smoke and raucousness, with a rampant display against a compliant Spurs.It was neither tense nor dramatic, but Liverpool have been by far the best side in thePremier Leaguethis season and that’s all that really matters.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It was originally built as part of a complex to house a 1924 trade fair. Early photographs show it to have been surrounded by fields, emphasising just how far it was from central London (it may only be 20 minutes now on the underground, but on a matchday, rammed in with tens of thousands of others, those can feel like very long minutes). Even the endlessly romanticised Twin Towers, built to recall the designs of Edwin Lutyens in New Delhi, actually housed a generator and a storeroom for flags.Wembley needed events, and the FA needed a venue for the Cup final; a deal was soon reached, and on 28 April 1923 Bolton beat West Ham 2-0 in the firstFA Cupfinal at Wembley. The game is most famous, though, for the scenes of PC George Scorey and his horse Billy clearing crowds well in excess of the 127,000 capacity off the pitch.

Lillard will probably miss most, if not all, of the 2025-26 NBA season.The team confirmed on Monday that Lillard will undergo surgery on the injury.Lillard was injured in the first quarter of Sunday’s 129-103 playoff loss to the Indiana Pacers. The non-contact injury occurred when the nine-time All-Star was trying to secure an offensive rebound, falling to the floor shortly before the midway point of the first quarter. He immediately grabbed his left leg, and was unable to get up. He was eventually helped off the court while keeping his left foot from touching the floor. Lillard wore a boot and used crutches when he was seen leaving the arena.NBA playoffs 2025 predictions: the winner, key players and dark horsesRead moreThe 34-year-old had just returned to action after missing time because of a blood clot in his right leg. He missed the final 14 games of the regular season and the first contest of this playoff series against the Pacers due to the clot.“This is a tough one,” Bucks coach Rivers said on Sunday night. “Blood clot followed by this. It’s just tough. ... He’s such a great freaking dude. No one deserves this. That’s why I feel bad. I’ve seen injuries that are deflating. This one hurt.”Lillard averaged 24.9 points, 7.1 assists and 4.7 rebounds in 58 regular-season games this season, his second in Milwaukee.He joined the Bucks in a trade in September 2023after leaving the Portland Trail Blazers, who he had been with since they selected him with the sixth overall pick in the 2012 draft. The Bucks, who won the NBA title in 2021, had been expected to challenge for another championship with Lillard playing alongside two-time league MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo. However, they lost to the Indiana Pacers in the first round of last season’s playoffs, and are 3-1 down in their current series and could be eliminated from the postseason in Tuesday’s Game 5.Lillard is under contract with the Bucks through the 2025-26 season and has a player option for 2026-27. He is owed $113m in salary during that span.Explore more on these topicsMilwaukee BucksNBABasketballUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

During the final change of ends of her fourth-round match against the Ukrainian qualifier Yulia Starodubtseva, as she served for a comfortable victory, she learned of the power outage that had ravaged Spain, Portugal and many nearby countries, ultimately forcing play to be postponed in Madrid.As matches across the tournament grounds had already come to a halt, the two players were told that they could play out the subsequent game, but there was a catch: the live electronic line‑calling system was no longer functioning and there were no line umpires to call upon. They would have to play as if they were juniors again, calling their own lines with only the umpire there to intervene. Naturally, Andreeva began to feel the pressure.Alex de Minaur sounds warning with ruthless victory at Madrid OpenRead more“It was 15-40 on my serve and I was like: ‘Oh, Mirra. Just please, please do everything in your power to just take this game and finish this match,’” she said, laughing. “I knew that if it would go to 5-5, probably we would have to wait. Probably I would not be here yet and I would just be waiting and we would just see what we would do.”From double break point down, Andreeva pulled herself together and closed out the match. A few metres away on the neighbouring stadium court, her next opponent was also one of the fortunate players:Coco Gauffhad been in the middle of her post‑match interview after a dominant win when the power shut down. Gauff noted she had actually requested to be scheduled as the second match on‑court; for once, she was thankful to the WTA supervisers for not honouring that request.“So far, the toughest thing has been not been able to shower after my match. There’s no running water so I just had to take baby wipes and wipe myself, spray some perfume and call it a day,” Gauff said an hour after her match. “I don’t even think we’ll be able to go back to the hotel as the traffic lights are out. So it’s just crazy how much we depend on electricity. It’s really insane. It puts that in perspective and also makes me think about the humans that lived before electricity and how impressive that is.”1:24Major power outage causes chaos in Spain and Portugal – video reportOther players were not quite as fortunate. Grigor Dimitrov, the 15th seed, held a match point against Britain’s Jacob Fearnley at 6-4, 5-2 before serving for the match a game later. By 5-4, the second set back on serve, both players were walking off the court. An hour later, Dimitrov could be found sitting down alone in the sun in a quiet outdoor spot players use to warm up, smiling to himself at such an surreal turn of events.“At this point this is only a situation that you can just laugh at if I was on-court because it’s probably not going to happen ever again,” Gauff said. “You can always remember the day the power went out at the Madrid Open.”As much of Madrid came to a standstill, that chaos was reflected inside the Caja Mágica. Unlike many other tournament sites, the Madrid Open grounds are mostly indoors, below ground level and there is minimal natural light off the court. It meant that much of the grounds were plunged in total darkness. In the communal fan areas, spectators stood shoulder to shoulder, packed like sardines, relying solely on the lights from their phones.View image in fullscreenBulgaria’s Grigor Dimitrov had his match with Britain’s Jacob Fearnley interrupted.Photograph: Thomas Coex/AFP/Getty ImagesThe players themselves had things slightly better. Shortly after the outage, workers swept in with candles, with the players’ restaurant and lounge eventually illuminated by dozens of candles. Every hour, the player warm-up area seemed to take on a completely different function. Shortly after the power cut, a number of players due on-court had been warming up in total darkness. An hour later, the room was filled with players simply lying on the floor, on the phone and talking with others. Eventually, as they admitted defeat, numerous massage tables appeared and the players ended their days with physiotherapy.“I was in the gym and it’s super dark, everyone is using the phones with flashlights, but it’s also kind of fun because everyone is talking to each other and the atmosphere is a little more friendly,” Andreeva said.It soon became clear that there would be no more play on this unforgettable day. As players scrambled to secure a lift home, the line at the transport desk extended almost as long as the Wimbledon queue. Their requests were recorded with pen and paper. With traffic lights ceasing to function in the city, a three-hour journey awaited for those who secured a car. Many opted for the one‑ to two‑hour walk. Once they reached home, this time they would not be able to distract themselves by playing video games, watching TV series or doomscrolling on social media. Not everyone seemed to mind.“If you take my phone away, I’m completely fine spending time without it,” said Andreeva, who turns 18 on Tuesday. “The only thing I need in my phone right now is a flashlight.”Explore more on these topicsTennisCoco GauffnewsShareReuse this content"

One concrete thing is that the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) have been involved in pushing for the Open to return to Trump-owned Turnberry.”Both the DCMS and Trump Turnberry declined to comment.Two other people briefed on conversations between the US president and Keir Starmer said Trump had asked the prime minister multiple times about hosting the Open at Turnberry, which the Trump Organization has owned since 2014.Trump has previously lobbied publicly to host the Open at the Ayrshire course, saying in 2023: “Everybody wants to see the Open championship here.”King Charles acknowledged the course’s importance to Trump whenhe wrote to him offering a visit to one of his Scottish estatesshould the president already be in the country visiting Turnberry.Hosting the Open could provide a welcome financial boost for SLC Turnberry, the course’s operating company, which is run by the president’s sons, Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. Last year the company lost £1.7m, having made £571,000 in the previous year – its only profit in 10 years.The R&A has a list of nine or 10 historic courses it would consider for hosting the Open, including famous venues such as St Andrews and Royal Birkdale. Turnberry is on that list, having hosted the championship in 2009. However golf experts point out that the event has grown substantially since then. While the 2009 Open attracted 123,000 people, the event at Royal Troon last year was attended by over 250,000.The R&A previously said it would not host the tournament at Turnberry in the wake of the January 6 attack by Trump supporters on the Capitol in 2021. Last November, the then head of the organisation, said he did not want “media noise” detracting from the game.Since then however the R&A has changed leadership. And in an apparent shift of position Mark Darbon, the new chief executive,said last weekhe would like to see the championship return to Turnberry “at some point”.Those briefed on the discussions between government officials and the R&A say they have mainly focused on the logistical challenges to hosting the Open at Turnberry. They said the main problems would be getting the sheer number of spectators in and out of the site by road, rail and air, given Turnberry is a two-and-a-half hour train trip from Glasgow, or a one-hour drive along a single A-road.Darbon said last week: “At Turnberry, there are definitely some logistical and commercial challenges that we face around the road, rail and accommodation infrastructure. We’re doing some feasibility work around what it would look like to return to that venue and the investment that it would require.”One ministertold the Financial Times earlier this yearthe venue would need “tens, or hundreds, of millions of pounds of investment” to make it easier to reach and to provide enough high-quality hotel accommodation in the area.A spokesperson for R&A said: “We regularly engage with government and local government regarding venues. We have explained the logistical challenges around Turnberry to the government and they are aware of the position.”Explore more on these topicsThe OpenDonald TrumpGolfLobbyingCivil serviceForeign policyScotlandnewsShareReuse this content"

If, and it remains quite a big if, he really is considering sacking Farke, the club’s chairman – who, perhaps significantly pulled out of a planned pre-match television interview at the last minute – must surely be having second thoughts after this.Leeds chairman flying to UK for talks with Daniel Farke over manager’s futureRead moreWin at Plymouth on Saturday and Farke’s formidably impressive Leeds will finish the season on 100 points and, due to their superior goal difference, clinch the Championship title. All kaleidoscopic passing and movement, they simply steamrolleredBristol Cityinto submission and the visiting manager, Liam Manning, can only hope that a defeat that could have been considerably heavier does not exert too much psychological damage at a vital moment.Although City are well placed to finish in the top six, they may still need to beat Preston at Ashton Gate on Saturday to secure a playoff semi-final against Sheffield United or, more probably, Sunderland. Manning’s players did not have a shot of any description until the 75th minute here.Given Farke’s achievement insecuring a top-two placelast week despite losing three of his best players in a £140m fire sale last summer, reports that he could be about to be sacked seem absurd. Although the manager is due to meet with Marathe this week to “discuss the future”, club sources claim it is all part of a routine end of season review and nothing out of the ordinary.Whatever the precise truth – given that the stories have not emerged from thin air it seems someone, somewhere clearly has an agenda –the club’s owners, the San Francisco-based 49ers Enterprises, are surely misguided if they really believe they can get a better manager? Do they not appreciate just how good Farke is?Interestingly, Angus Kinnear, the outgoing Everton-bound Leeds chief executive penned an ode to the German in Monday’s match programme. “I want to congratulate Daniel on an almost immaculate season,” he wrote. “This club needs a leader with broad shoulders, strong principles and unshakeable belief if it is to be successful. I don’t believe we could have a better leader.”Farke himself remained characteristically poised before kick-off, telling a television interviewer: “It’s not my topic … I just recommend you don’t believe everything you read in a newspaper.”View image in fullscreenLargie Ramazani fires home Leeds’ fourth goal in stoppage time.Photograph: Robbie Jay Barratt/AMA/Getty ImagesAfterwards, still soaked in the champagne his players had sprayed over him at the final whistle, he proved similarly diplomatic. “Right now it’s just about celebrating this special day,” said Farke. “I’m not worried about myself, I’m very proud of what we’ve achieved. I signed a long term contract here and the next step is to establish this side in the Premier League.”Earlier, dressed in his trademark black parka, Farke took his place in the home dugout on an unusually warm late April evening, the ground turned into a sea of twirling yellow scarves as the stadium rocked to a raucously rousing rendition of the club anthem “Marching on Together”.Five years ago when Leeds were last promoted to the Premier League, the Covid pandemic dictated that locals were denied their party. They certainly made up for it here and a City team penned into their own half and struggling to string two passes together proved perfectly obliging guests.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

City mark zonally but that system failed here.O’Leary initially kept them in the game, with the best of several fine saves denying Solomon. Leeds though monopolised possession and doubled their lead when Wilfried Gnonto ran onto Piroe’s superb through ball and expertly lifted his shot over the advancing O’Leary.By way of emphasising that 30 points separate these sides, substitute Largie Ramazani scored the third with his first touch after meeting a ball from Junior Firpo as perfectly calibrated as Leeds performance.When Ramazani controlled Ilia Gruev’s through pass and whipped a stoppage-time fourth past O’Leary Elland Road offered Farke a standing ovation.

There were shouts of joy as the weight of what they had just achieved dawned on the players, havingreached a Champions League finalfor the first time since the club won it in 2007.The team’s leader, the normally stoic Kim Little had tears in her eyes. She was soon joined by Lia Wälti who came over to her midfield colleague and wrapped her in a long embrace, a quiet moment of triumph in the mayhem.Slegers ‘so proud’ as Arsenal book WCL final place after stunning comebackRead moreIt seemed the perfect way to celebrate the Arsenal captain, a player who has served the club for 15 seasons (in two stints) and has built her career on her understated brilliance. Little is not a vocal leader; instead, she commands the respect of those around her by letting her football do the talking.At 34 years old and edging slightly towards the end of her career, there is still no doubt Little remains one of the talents of her generation, one who perhaps deserves to be celebrated more frequently.She is the heartbeat of Renée Slegers’s side, a steady presence in the centre of the pitch who has adapted her game over the years to suit the needs of her team. Other players attract more headlines, but the former Scotland international holds the pieces of the puzzle together, quietly dictating the tempo.Against Lyon, she produced a performance for the ages, controlling the middle of the park alongside the effervescent Mariona Caldentey as they nullified the threat from the eight-times European champions. It was a display that earned her player of the match and one that reminded everyone she still has so much to give.“The first and only person I wanted to see was Kim,” said a visibly emotional Leah Williamson. “Kim Little is an unbelievable footballer who goes under the radar all the time.View image in fullscreenArsenal’s Kim Little in action with Lyon’s Lindsey Heaps.Photograph: Manon Cruz/Reuters“Unfortunately, the international stage didn’t provide her with any of these incredible opportunities but she’s a player worthy of seven or eight Champions League titles. I’m very proud the team did that for her today.”Her manager was equally eager to celebrate a player who, when fit, is one of the first names on the teamsheet. You can only imagine how much of a help Little’s presence has been to Slegers since she put in temporary charge last October and thenofficially appointed managerin January.“It was such a special moment for Kim,” the Arsenal manager said. “She has been a part of the club for so long. If you see how she invests and how much she works … all the players see it and feel it. Leah Williamson said it in the huddle afterwards.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The way she performs is incredible and it was highlighted by the player group as well.”There is no doubt Arsenal will need her more than ever as they take on the indomitable Barcelona on 24 May. The holders are chasing theirthird successive Champions League titleand in their8-2 demolition of Chelseaarguably looked even better than ever. The burgeoning partnership between Little and Caldentey will be key if Arsenal are to be successful.Quick GuideWCL success boosts status of English clubsShowThe runners-up in the Women's Super League next season will get a direct qualification spot in the main \"League phase\" of the 2026-27 Women's Champions League, in addition to the WSL champions, owing to English clubs' strong performances in the WCL.Arsenal's run to the final this season, combined with Chelsea reaching the semi-finals for a third consecutive campaign and Manchester City's run to this season's quarter-final, have all helped to boost the English league's coefficient in Uefa's points-based system, which assesses performances over the past five seasons. The WSL previously has only had one automatic spot in the main stage of the competition, for the domestic champions.England's rise up to second place in the coefficient ranking, from fourth, will also mean that the WSL's third-placed side can enter the final round of qualifying, rather than entering in the earlier rounds, which will still be the case in August 2025 when the third-placed WSL side from this side – currently set to be Manchester United – will need to progress through multiple rounds of qualifying to reach the main league phase. From 2026, just one two-legged tie would stand in their way. No English club has won European women's football's top prize since Arsenal in 2007.Tom GarryWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Caldentey has been a revelation for them since signing from the Spanish champions in the summer, adopting a deeper role while continuing to influence in front of goal. They will need to be at their very best when faced with the threats of Aitana Bonmatí, Patri Guijarro and Alexia Putellas in order to control the central areas and attempt to stop Barcelona playing through the lines.Little will guide her team on the biggest stage in European football with the same unassuming level-headedness she has displayed for years. In Lisbon, she will equal the club record for Champions League appearances held by Emma Byrne. She will not want the fuss but it is an accolade worth noting whatever the outcome. Predictably, however, it will be her teammates who will lead the charge in that respect rather than Little herself.Explore more on these topicsArsenal WomenWomen's Champions LeagueWomen's footballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Should the RFU host Chelsea at Twickenham, it would be a lucrative move for the union, which last November announced record losses and is struggling to break even.No green light: RFU threatens to leave Twickenham over Beyoncé spatRead moreAsked if the RFU’s licence would allow for Twickenham to stage Chelsea fixtures, Sweeney said: “It would allow it to happen. There have been conversations previously about possible Premiership [sic] clubs coming here. Richmond council, Richmond borough is more concerned about that. I just think in terms of impact on local residents, numbers of fans and so on they’re a little bit more sensitive. It may depend on which club it is. It would be a big financial number, I know Richmond borough would definitely have a conversation about that though.”The RFU is planning a £660m redevelopment of Twickenham, assuming a move to Milton Keynes is off the table. Sweeney said last month that it would be “a very difficult call” to stay at Twickenham if Richmond council did not grant a licence to host more concerts and mentioned Milton Keynes and Birmingham as possible destinations.The RFU is permitted to host three a year and only two on consecutive nights with a limited capacity of 55,000. The union says Twickenham, which has a capacity of 82,000, is empty for 340 days a year with Sweeney previously claiming that, due to the restrictions, the RFU missed out onstaging Beyoncé concerts. As a result the RFU is lobbying Richmond council for 15 events a year at a capacity of 75,000 and expects an answer by September.“We’re making really good progress with Richmond,” Sweeney said. “The conversations with them have been positive, it’s a cooperative process. They see the value that we bring to the area and they understand why we need to have more non-rugby events when you compare it to Tottenham, Wembley, the O2, they can see why we need those non-rugby events to make the thing viable.“We’ve always said our preference was to remain here. Not just for cultural reasons and the history. Hospitality and ticketing are 50% of our revenue and from a geographical point of view this is a really important part of the country to be in. There was a lot of investigation into what the different options are and we came out saying our preference would be to remain here.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Only one team could be promoted.WSL: Hemp and Greenwood returns lift Manchester City, Crystal Palace go downRead moreWolves have met all the criteria to play second-tier football but it has emerged the club did not apply, and the players were informed of this during a team meeting on Sunday after full-time in their 6-0 home victory against Liverpool Feds, their final game of the season.Wolves did not wish to comment on the matter when contacted on Monday by the Guardian with a series of questions.Beth Merrick described the situation as “crazy”, before the midfielder said: “Imagine fighting for promotion all season, to find out our Championship bid was never submitted. As a group we are absolutely devastated to finish the season this way and believe it speaks volumes about the club’s ambitions for the women’s team. For our staff to have to deliver this news to us moments after is astonishing.“Our players, staff and fans deserve so much better. The staff have put in hours of dedication, for a bid to never be submitted. It’s not about money, it’s about honesty and transparency.”Any third-tier clubs interested in applying for a second-tier licence, to be ready for promotion subject to their final league position, initially had until 20 December 2024 to express their intent to apply, before the formal deadline to submit a second-tier application, which was on 21 February.The list of criteria included a requirement to provide evidence a club could attract average home attendances of at least 600 spectators, while also requiring clubs to commit to appointing the following staff within one month of next season starting: a head of women’s football, marketing manager, head coach, assistant coach, physiotherapist or sports therapist, doctor, a strength and conditioning coach, a goalkeeping coach and several people in specific safeguarding and player-welfare roles, as well as a matchday safety manager.It is also understood that the company running the Women’s Championship, Women’s Professional Leagues Limited, has proposed to raise the minimum contact hours per week for players up to 20 hours per week, although this proposal remains subject to receiving final shareholder approval.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Arsenal are not a serious football club. Manchester United are hopeless. Chelsea are a shambolic mess. Lads, it’s Tottenham. They got lucky with knack. They had help from the PGMOL. While we’ll leave it up to you to decide which of the above statements are true, most if not all have been mooted as the main reasons Liverpool won the Premier League this season by fans whose almost heroic begrudgery in the face of their own teams’ failure has to be commended. Of course, a more considered view is thatLiverpool are the champions againbecause they are quite obviously the best football team in the country and have only lost two football matches throughout a campaign from which few of their own fans, no TV or radio pundits and only one particularly enlightened, erudite andprescient podcast regularpredicted they would prevail before a ball was kicked. And because Arsenal are not a serious football club.With the title up for grabs and Dr Tottenham paying a house call, the pre-match sense around Anfield was that securing the point Liverpool needed towin their 20th championshipwould be little more than a formality. On a hiding to nothing and with the embarrassment of being knocked out of Bigger Vase by a team from the Arctic Circle over the next fortnight to focus on, an even more below strength Spurs than usual didn’t so much threaten to poop the party as add to the general gaiety of the occasion by taking an early lead even they knew they were never, ever going to hang on to. Liverpool duly swatted them aside, withMo Salaheven taking the time out to grab a phone and take a selfie with the Kop by way of celebrating his 28th top-flight goal of the season. The moment stood in stark contrast to the last time Liverpool won a title during the pandemic, when any such photo would have featured the beaming Egyptian and countless rows of empty red plastic seats. “Liverpool have more [Big Cups] and today will equal Manchester United’s 20 League titles – the debate is over,” said Gary Neville ahead of the game, upon being asked which is England’s most successful club. “Liverpool’s success should cause pain and heartache [to United fans].” The Sky Sports co-commentator wisely opted out of joining his fellow pundits on the pitch for the post-match debrief, choosing instead to remain in the comparative safety of his perch on the gantry.While the mawkish, omnipresent and supercilious “this means more” cobblers dreamed up by some beanbag-dwelling marketing wonk erroneously suggests Liverpool fans somehow love their club on a level their counterparts at others couldn’t possibly comprehend, winning the title clearly meant an awful lot to everyone at the game and their ticketless brethren assembled outside the ground. Many held flares aloft, a number of which sent thick clouds of blue smoke billowing into the air over Merseyside after one mischievous Everton fan had bought a job lot of them and spent the weeks building up to yesterday’s game diligently changing the labels before selling them outside Anfield. We can but hope this entrepreneurial prankster’s reach extends as far as the Vatican, so that the traditional signal that a new pope has been elected will also serve as a tribute to Everton’s imminent departure from Goodison Park. For now, Merseyside and the Premier League is red and one suspects even Arne Slot’sfamously critical fathermight have been quietly impressed by the scenes he saw unfold at Anfield yesterday afternoon.QUOTE OF THE DAYSomebody said the Welsh have the ‘heart of a poet and the fist of a fighter.’ That’s what I love about this place.

Fortunately, Neapolitans are expert in creating sobriquets for closest friends and greatest heroes.At full time on Sunday, a Dazn interviewer asked him which nickname was his favourite: “MacGyver, McTerminator, McFratm, orApribottiglie[The Bottle Opener], because you always score the first goal?”View image in fullscreenMcTominay has a bond with Napoli fans for his efforts on and off the pitch.Photograph: Matteo Ciambelli/ReutersMcTominay started laughing before the question was finished. “[Napoli defender] Pasquale Mazzocchi would say McFratm!” he said, dissolving to giggles together with another teammate, Leonardo Spinazzola, stood next to him.This is local humour, an in-joke, referencing years-old memes about someone mispronouncingMcFlurry at a drive-through. Mazzocchi was born and raised in Naples. McTominay only got here eight months ago, yet somehow he simply belongs.Answers like this one, almost as much as his on-pitch performances, help explain why the fans adore him, why Billy Gilmour has told reporters he cannot go anywhere in the city with his fellow Scotsman without getting mobbed. There have been plenty of players down the years who found the experience of playing in Naples, the closeness demanded by fans, overwhelming, but those who embrace it will have their affection returned a thousand-fold.In word and deed, McTominay has been all-in from day one. He has talked about the difficulty of learning Italian yet already speaks it well enough that he does not need journalists’ questions translated. His confidence speaking has grown to the point ofrecording messages for the fans.He raves about the food, not in the generic way that any person might praise Italian cuisine butwith specific passion for the flavour of locally grown tomatoes. Even when things have been going well on the pitch, McTominay has spoken with an obsessive intensity about wanting to do better.In an interview with La Gazzetta dello Sport this month, he was asked whether he had expected to make such an immediate impact inSerie A. “I see it differently,” McTominay replied. “I really think I could give more than I have so far. Some games I’ve ended disappointed because I could have scored more goals. I didn’t take full advantage of certain chances.”He was speaking just before this recent run of five goals in three games but was already the club’s second-highest scorer. Even as his manager, Antonio Conte, was railing against excessive media expectations, reminding reporters that Napoli finished 10th last season and hinting at his frustrations over the mid-season departure, without replacement, of Khvicha Kvaratskhelia, McTominay was reiterating his intent to win it all.View image in fullscreenMcTominay pounces to score Napoli’s second goal against Torino.Photograph: Cesare Abbate/EPA“At primary school I wrote down that my dream was to win the league,” he said. “At the start it was the Premier League, but as life goes on your dreams change. Today it’s the Italian league.”Napoli are not a one-man show. For all Conte’s laments – some justified – this is still a team that spent almost €150m on transfer fees last summer. Alessandro Buongiorno, signed from Torino, has been a major upgrade when fit at centre-back, while Romelu Lukaku has 12 goals and 10 assists in Serie A.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Conte has helped several of them, including the captain Giovanni Di Lorenzo and midfielder Frank Anguissa, to get back to their best.Still, without McTominay it is hard to imagine they would lead the league today. Team performances have faded in the second half of the campaign, the absence of Kvaratskhelia’s creative magic being felt. Napoli were struggling to carve out chances against last-placed Monza a week ago before McTominay sealed the points with a late header.Against Torino he struck early, side-footing in Anguissa’s centre at the near post in the seventh minute. But Napoli did not dominate after that. If anything, Torino enjoyed the better chances of a cagey first half, right up until McTominay pounced again with another first-time conversion of a cross from the right.These goals were no acts of chance. McTominay’s success in Naples has many contributing factors, his talent and application being the greatest of all, but Conte’s tactics have been a huge element. This is what the manager does best: identifying a player’s strengths and devising specific, precise systems – drilled relentlessly on the training ground – to exploit them.Conte has allowed McTominay to be the player he was always meant to be, something between a No 8 and No 10, breaking the lines and arriving in the box to score goals just like these ones. His 11 strikes make this the most prolific season by a Scottish player in Serie A, surpassing the 10 scored by Denis Law for Torino in 1961-62.Quick GuideSerie A resultsShowAtalanta 1-1 Lecce, Napoli 2-0 Torino, Juventus 2-0 Monza, Fiorentina 2-1 Empoli, Inter 0-1 Roma, Como 1-0 Genoa, Venezia 0-2 Milan.MondayUdinese v Bologna, Lazio v Parma, Verona v Cagliari.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.There is a second side to this story of Napoli’s title push. They could only pull clear on Sunday because Inter lost again – a third defeat in eight days. The defending champions look spent,exhausted from their ambitious pursuit of a quadruple. After failing to score against Bologna, Milan or Roma, and crashing out of the Coppa Italia against their city rivals, it now looks most likely they will end with no trophies at all.Conte claimed on Sunday not to have followed their game, played a few hours before Napoli faced Torino. “I switched off my phone and everything,” he said. “At the end I heard some people were happy.”A whole city, in fact. Two years after celebrating their third league title, Napoli are in within touching distance of a fourth. If Diego Maradona was the hero of the first two, and Kvaratskhelia shared top billing with Victor Osimhen for the most recent, it might well be McTominay who is remembered as the face of this side. “A Scottish Neapolitan”,in the words of one popular local news site.

It was not, insisted Dino Toppmöller, a final. Nor a playoff. Nor was it even the most important match of the season. All it was, according to theEintracht Frankfurtcoach the day before the game, was quite simply: “Matchday 31.”By the end, as Saturday night drew in, it was definitely Saturday night. It turned out that Toppmöller’s less-is-more approach suited his team perfectly. They had thrashed RB Leipzig, their significantly more wealthy rivals for a Champions League spot, and were six points clear of their fifth-placed opposition with three games left, staring a return to the promised land square in the eyes.Eintracht’s jubilant players celebrated as they deserved to after such an effort, though Toppmöller told Sky “they had to turn [the music] off for a minute so I could say a few things.” Even he, though, was prepared to admit it is now close. “We’ve taken a huge step,” he said, “[though] the job isn’t finished yet.”Many, however, had doubted it was possible. Eintracht have been prolific and highly successful sellers in recent seasons, but you suspected theJanuary exit of Omar Marmoushwould be a step too far. Selling is the model, and before the season began it was envisaged Marmoush and probably the midfielder Hugo Larsson would be next to go, following Luka Jovic, Randal Kolo Muani, Willian Pacho and the rest. The Egyptian’s exit to Manchester City, partially driven by the outgoing Premier League champions’ desperation to re-dynamise, was a window earlier than sporting director, Markus Krösche, would have liked.Scott McTominay bathes in the adoration as Napoli leap clear in title race | Nicky BandiniRead moreIf Eintracht Frankfurt had a shot at making the Champions League, it had all been down to Marmoush. Having gradually developed in theBundesliga, first at Wolfsburg and then after his move west, he had become a force of nature, a blanket attacking solution with a fix for any situation via his power, pace and finishing ability. Marmoush reached theWinterpauseas the league’s second-top scorer behind Harry Kane and having made Eintracht a bona fide Europa League contender.Then he went. Marmoush completed his move on 23 January, but inside the club it was not a shock. Six days before the transfer he came out to wave a fond farewell to the fans after they beat hapless Borussia Dortmund on a Friday night. It did, however, cast a shadow over the rest of the campaign. It was almost like The Chaser. Did Eintracht have enough of a lead in the Champions League race to keep the wolf from the door?View image in fullscreenOmar Marmoush trailed only Harry Kane in the Bundesliga scoring charts when he left in January.Photograph: Philipp Kresnik/SPP/ShutterstockSince the main man departed for England it has been predictably bumpy. Marmoush’s parting gift had been – as well as the sterling service and the €70m fee – the position he had helped lift the team to. It felt as if they were going to need all of that head start. Directly after his move they won one in seven in all competitions (the win was over relegation certainties Holstein Kiel), suffering four Bundesliga defeats in six at the back end of that. But when those he left behind needed to step up they did, and then some.In recent weeks poise was regained and a sense of an opportunity to be taken has loomed larger. That steady climb to making sure Eintracht kept what was in their grasp has been epitomised by Hugo Ekitiké, still only 22 but not unaccustomed to setbacks. His four goals and four assists in the past nine games underline his place as the latest in a line of top-quality centre-forwards developed at Eintracht.His goal that gave them the lead in theEuropa League quarter-final at Tottenhamwas all him, an individual marvel. On Saturday, he was smart to open the game up, neatly prising Leipzig apart for Ansgar Knauff to put Eintracht in front. The brilliant Ekitiké’s third, emphatically headed in from Jean-Mattéo Bahoya’s perfect cross to seal the game, also took him level with Marmoush on 15 Bundesliga goals for the season, symbolising the team’s ability to get along despite everything.View image in fullscreenEintracht Frankfurt fans pay tribute to Werner Lorant, a former player who died last week.Photograph: Action Press/ShutterstockThat they achieved this “statement win,” as Toppmöller called it, at home, meant even more. You had wondered if the famously formidable atmosphere at the Deutsche Bank Park – particularly on European nights – would overwhelm Ange Postecoglou’s fragile team when they visited, having failed to make their own first-leg dominance in London count, and putDie Adlercloser to a second Europa League title in four years. If the occasion overwhelmed anyone,it was the residents.Against Leipzig, Eintracht rose to the occasion, even knowing full well how big it was. Toppmöller will be rewarded with a new deal and his players will get their recompense in standing to attention on their home pitch and hearing the Champions League anthem at least four times come autumn and winter. That, truly, will be something special.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Kane will watch Saturday’s potential title-winner at Leipzig from the stand after picking up a fifth yellow card.For Leverkusen the results are not anywhere near the full picture. The Carlo Ancelotti situation at Real Madrid is a huge problem, as they don’t know whether Xabi Alonso is coming or going – and neither does he. Senior players including Robert Andrich talked of the destabilising effects (“there is a lot of unrest around the team”), with his future and those of Florian Wirtz and Jonas Hofmann, among others, also in doubt. A club that are the most meticulous of planners are in a situation where they simply can’t.Back with the mere mortals in the Champions League race, Freiburg were the big winners, now fourth after victory at Wolfsburg, their third in a row, which takes them above Leipzig.

In the time that has elapsed since their 2012 triumph, the club has drifted into a state of dereliction and destitution. Their relegation from Ligue 1 confirmed,La Pailladeexit the stage with a whimper; it may be a while before they grace it once more.Montpellier are a family club.Louis “LouLou” Nicollinis the founding president of the club and upon his death, in 2017, ownership passed to his son, Laurent. LouLou who died aged 74, continues to be honoured in the 74th minute of every home match by the fans, but there was a mixture of applause and boos at Sunday’s commemoration. Families don’t always get along and relationships have buckled under the strain of the most devastating season in the club’s 50-year history. Disunity reigns at the Mosson.Ligue 1’s two-faced truth: European success is masking financial ruin | Philippe AuclairRead moreThe 74th minute of the dour 0-0 draw against Reims on Sunday – which halted MHSC’s 11-game losing run and constituted their first clean sheet of the season – coincided with Téji Savanier coming off the bench. Savanier is anenfant du club,having come through Montpellier’s academy before returning in 2019. He is the emblematic and humble captain; a player who lives in the same neighbourhood he grew up in, despite his riches, who holidays in a campsite on the outskirts of town, who rejected the chance to go to Milan in favour ofLa Pailladeandwhose love for the club and the city could never be questioned. Or at least not until recently.The defeat to fourth-tier Le Puy in the Coupe de France was embarrassing in itself, but it will be remembered more as a moment that sullied Savanier’s image. “Last inLigue 1– does that hurt?” teased a Le Puy fan in a viral video posted on social media. “When you’re being paid €210,000 a month, no,” responded Savanier, who was condemned by the club and stripped of the captaincy. Relegated to a bit-part role, statistically, this has been his worst season, and it will be his last, too.The experienced spine of the team will be dismantled. It isn’t just Savanier the club are seeking to offload – Wahbi Khazri, Benjamin Lecomte, Jordan Ferri, and Falaye Sacko are also touted for departures. Andy Delort was also parachuted back to the club on loan in January with the mission of saving MHSC from the drop. He is yet to score a goal and has not been included in the past two squads.View image in fullscreenA banner unveiled by the Montpellier fans against Monaco tells the players: ‘You embody the worst version of our club: shame on you’.Photograph: FEP/Icon Sport/Getty ImagesMany of the aforementioned stalwarts have already had their game time reduced in recent weeks, since the arrival of Zoumana Camara as manager. The former PSG youth coach replaced an exhausted Jean-Louis Gasset this month.“Maybe I’m a football has-been,” said Gasset, who had replaced Michel Der Zakarian earlier in the campaign. The returning club legend never looked like saving the sinking ship and he rarely struck an optimistic tone. “It’s over” and “we have to stop believing” are the pick of Gasset’s quotes that best surmise the acceptance of fate. If words aren’t enough, the club’s decision to sell their starting attacking trio – Akor Adams, Musa al-Taamari and Arnaud Nordin – in January paints the picture clearly. Sporting ambition left the room quite a long time ago.Gasset remains at the club, albeit now in a backroom role, and he elected Camara as his successor. The new man has been looking to the future, giving time to young players and academy products. However, along with the experienced spine, the best and brightest – Joris Chotard, Khalil Fayad, and Becir Omeragic – will also be forced out in a desperate bid to raise funds.Last year’s accounts showed the wage bill was almost equivalent to the club’s entire income. Thefinancial crisis gripping French footballmore generally, which could be further exacerbated by the uncertainty surrounding the continuation of DAZN’s broadcasting deal, has hit Montpellier particularly hard. The finger has naturally been pointed at Nicollin, who did not help matters with his vociferous support of the LFP president and close friend Vincent Labrune, the architect of that botched broadcasting deal last summer.But there are plenty of fingers to be pointed. “At some point, we will have to stop laughing,” said Nicollin after the defeat to Angers on 13 April. “There are people whose story with the club is over, whatever happens. We will go forward with a healthy base of people who want to fight for the club and people who aren’t just there for their own sake. I’ve spoken and spoken, the people that this concerns will understand.”View image in fullscreenTeji Savanier has been stripped of the captaincy and relegated to a bit-part role after an inflammatory post on social media.Photograph: PSNEWZ/SIPA/ShutterstockThose comments shocked an emotional Ferri. “If our president said that, I don’t have a lot to say. I don’t even want to speak more than that.”The president has turned on his players and the fans have turned on the club. With relegation confirmed before Montpellier’s match against Reims thanks to Le Havre’s draw against Monaco, the Mosson was sparsely populated, the atmosphere not aided by the closure of the ultras stand after violent scenes led to the abandonment of the match against Saint-Étienne in March. There was anger then, there is a feeling of ambivalent resignation now.Those who were present for the non-event booed the entrances of Khazri and Savanier, witnessed a dire state of affairs. Montpellier are a club at war with themselves, but one despite relegation are trying to right their wrongs and look to the future. The future is uncertain though, and the fear of a Bordeaux 2.0 lingers. Montpellier’s 50th anniversary celebrations this season have been anything but. At their lowest ebb, the objective must simply be to survive for another 50.Quick GuideLigue 1 resultsShowMarseille 4-1 Brest, Lens 0-4 Auxerre, Montpellier 0-0 Reims, Nantes 0-0 Toulouse, Angers 0-2 Lille, Lyon 4-1 Rennes, Le Havre 1-1 Monaco, Strasbourg 3-1 St-Étienne, PSG 1-3 Nice.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Talking points“We have this obsession with the Champions League,” said Luis Enrique abefore PSG’s meeting with Nice on Friday.

Youssouf Ndayishimiye’s game-clinching third came from a free-kick and 38% of all the goals conceded byLes Parisienshave now come from set pieces. Their weakness is Arsenal’s strength and one that the Gunners will be hopeful of exploiting. “Records aren’t our primary goal, titles are,” said Luis Enrique last week. “If someone assured me that losing to Nice would get me into the Champions League final, I’d sign up immediatelyDomestic invincibility has been sacrificed; time will tell if it yields European glory.The race for the Champions League remains enthralling. Amine Gouiri’s spectacular hat-trick helped Marseille comfortably beat Brest to cap a week that marked the start of a multi-week training camp in Rome – an unprecedented move to distance the club from what is perceived as a toxic atmosphere in their native city.

But that doesn’t mean anything because every single match is different. Everybody speaks about the Premier League as being the best league in the world. I don’t know if I agree or not. But we are full of confidence and looking forward to playing in the semi-final.”Enrique said before taking over at PSG in 2023 that he wanted to work in English football in the future and has previously been linked with Chelsea and Tottenham. Asked to clarify whether he thought the Premier League is the best in the world Enrique, who has a spiky relationship with the French media despite his successful record so far, said: “It doesn’t matter. Whatever I say, everybody is going to criticise me.”PSG were without their top scorer Ousmane Dembélé for their last trip to north London in October after the France forward had a falling out with Enrique, with Kai Havertz and Bukayo Saka sealing a comfortable2-0 victoryfor Arsenal. Enrique said that his side, wholost 3-1 against Niceat the weekend to end a run of 30 matches unbeaten in Ligue 1, have learned from that game and are ready to make history afterlosing against Bayern Munichin the 2020 final.“The game that you are talking about took place on 1 October so that was seven or eight months ago. There are huge differences between now and then,” he said. “I have reviewed the game, and seen how far our game has come and we are better now. We are a more complete team.“Our next objective is to rewrite history and there is only one way to do that. I would like to remind you that Arsenal has not won theChampions Leaguebefore and only one of us will get the ticket to the final over the two legs and I hope that will be PSG.”Vitinha has been outstanding in PSG’s run to the semi-finals, although the Portugal midfielder said he has not been on his best form sincethe 3-2 defeatto Villa in the second leg of their quarter-final. He only made 19 appearances for Wolves after joining them on a season’s loan from Porto as a 20-year-old in 2020 and believes he has benefited from the experience.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The record defeat by Gloucester was a 12th from 15 Premiership matches for the two-time champions this season, leaving them in ninth spot with only Newcastle below them.It is hard to see either Hunter or Hepher returning to their roles after a review into the defeat on Sunday, as well as the miserable campaign, has been completed but Rowe said: “No final decision regarding the club’s coaching structure going forward has been made, and it would be improper to make any further comment until all internal procedures have been completed.”It is less than five years sinceExetercompleted a league and Champions Cup double but more recently they have been hit by a string of high-profile departures including Jack Nowell, Luke Cowan-Dickie and Sam Simmonds. They have also had to contend with a long-term shoulder injury to Immanuel Feyi-Waboso since December but have conceded 50-plus points on five occasions this season, including the 69 scored by Bordeaux and 64 by Toulouse – both times on home turf at Sandy Park.After the humiliation at the hands of Gloucester, Hunter said: “Aside from how we feel individually, the first thing to recognise is that it was no way acceptable for us to perform like that. There is no hiding away, and we haven’t tried to hide away from that in the changing room.“Quite clearly, we have gone underneath an avalanche of pressure and intensity from Gloucester and wilted underneath it. It is not a case of back to the drawing board, it is more a case of lessons you feel you are learning, you are not learning.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Brecel won the sprint to the dressing room as he summoned a break of 71 to see off the 2016 finalist 13-4, and he was swiftly followed by O’Sullivan, who rifled in a break of 95 to complete his victory over Pang by the same score.Having barely been challenged to get out of second gear by his outclassed opponent, O’Sullivan, who came to Sheffield having not played acompetitive match since January, remained predictably downbeat about his performance.Rating his form as “probably two out of 10”, O’Sullivan, who will face another Chinese opponent, Si Jiahui, in the last eight, said: “I wasn’t bothered about getting it over quickly – I need all the table time I can get. I think I’ve dragged them (my opponents) down to a poorer level. I think they expected me to play better and were maybe shocked that I didn’t, but I don’t think Si will fall into that trap, and that’s what makes him dangerous.”Si, a shock semi-finalist on hisCrucible debut two years ago, survived a late scare to see off Ben Woollaston 13-10 and confirm his place in the quarters.Asked about his chances of winning a record eighth Crucible crown, O’Sullivan said: “I’d have to play a lot better. I’d have to start potting a few long ones, pinning them to the back rail a bit more. It needs a bit more improving in those areas really.”Brecel’s own victory was shaped by a stunning first session on Saturday, for which he had jetted in on a private jet from Belgium with four hours to spare, and proceeded to compile two centuries and three more breaks over 50 as he racked up a virtually unassailable 7-1 lead.View image in fullscreenLuca Brecel needed only one frame in the evening session to reach the last eight.Photograph: Danny Lawson/PA“I don’t like to hang around too long,” said Brecel, who had hired the jet with the help of his friend, the Arsenal and Belgium winger Leonardo Trossard, but neglected to reveal its cost. “I always try to get here as late as possible. Even today I came in 15 minutes before the game. That has always been my way, and as long as it works, that’s good.”Brecel, who will face Judd Trump in the last eight, arrived at the Championships in negligible form but believes he stands a chance of repeating hisstunning run to the title in 2023.“I’m not sure if I’m playing as good as then but I’m definitely not so worried about winning the title,” he said. “Two years ago it felt like a golden chance, and now I feel like I can get back there and do it again, so it’s not that much pressure.”Earlier, Trump held off a spirited fightback from Shaun Murphy, who recovered from 12-6 down to reel off four consecutive breaks over 70 and reduce the deficit to 12-10, to reach the quarter-finals. Murphy had a chance to close further but a missed red to the corner let in Trump for a break of 58 which effectively secured a hard-fought 13-10 win.“Shaun was in a world of his own for them four or five frames,” Trump told the BBC. “I was a little bit worried but I just had to back myself in that last frame to put a nice stroke on that first red and get in. By the time it’s got to 12-10, you’re probably starting to think the worst. The way he was potting the balls as well … Shaun when he gets the support around him absolutely loves it.”Explore more on these topicsWorld Snooker ChampionshipRonnie O'SullivanJudd TrumpSnookernewsShareReuse this content"

The left-hander reached his 100 in 35 balls to register the second-fastest century inIPLhistory.ICC rejects Ben Stokes’ plea for review of over-rate penalties in TestsRead moreThe former England captain Jos Buttler had earlier scored 50 not out from 26 deliveries and had a front-row seat for the remarkable display, keeping wicket for the Titans as Suryavanshi teed off. Jofra Archer was among the Royals players celebrating with Suryavanshi as they wrapped up an eight-wicket win.Not surprisingly, Suryavanshi was named as the player of the match. Speaking at the post-match presentation ceremony, the teenager said: “It is like a dream to score a century in the IPL. It feels really good. The results are showing for what I have been practising for the last three to four months. I don’t see the ground so much, just focus on the ball.”Yashasvi Jaiswal, who combined with Suryavanshi for a 166-run opening partnership, said: “Incredible innings, one of the best I’ve seen. Hope he’ll keep doing it for us for a long time. He was incredible today. He just played amazing shots. He works hard in the nets, we can see that. He has the game, he has the temperament and mentality.”Suryavanshi grabbed headlines when he became the youngest player to earn a contract in the lucrative IPLat the age of 13, before making his debut this month and announcing himself in style with a six off the first ball he faced.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

TheNBAacknowledged the mistake shortly after the game, saying a foul should have been called on the Knicks’ Josh Hart.Had the foul been called, Hardaway would have been awarded three free throws with about 0.3 seconds left. Instead, the game ended on that play and Detroit were left fuming.“You guys saw it,” Hardaway said after the game, speaking to reporters. “Blatant.”The Knicks took a 3-1 lead in the series after their victory, with Game 5 in New York on Tuesday.“During live play, it was judged that Josh Hart made a legal defensive play,” crew chief David Guthrie told the media after the game. “After postgame review, we observed that Hart makes body contact that is more than marginal to Hardaway Jr and a foul should have been called.”Hart didn’t dispute that he made contact with Hardaway.“Did I make contact with him? Yeah, I made contact with him,” Hart said. “Was it legal? I don’t know. We’ll let the two-minute report say that.”The NBA puts out a review of all calls in the final two minutes of games decided by three points or fewer, with those reports released the day after the game. But in this case, the NBA had Guthrie speak to a reporter and explain what happened.Detroit argued to no avail after time expired. Pistons coach JB Bickerstaff was clearly angered and approached the officiating crew, but he had no recourse to challenge the call. Firstly, the Pistons had used their challenge earlier in the game and secondly, even if Bickerstaff still had the challenge it wouldn’t have mattered – technically, no call was made, so he couldn’t have challenged.“There’s contact on Tim Hardaway’s jump shot,” Bickerstaff said. “I don’t know any other way around it. There’s contact on his jump shot. The guy leaves his feet, he’s at Timmy’s mercy. I repeat, there’s contact on his jump shot.”The Pistons had the ball with 11.1 seconds left, down by one. Cade Cunningham missed a jump shot with 7.4 seconds remaining and, after a scramble, the ball ended up in Hardaway’s hands in the left corner. Hardaway ball-faked to get Hart into the air, and Hart clearly made contact with the right side of Hardaway’s body as he was in the act of shooting.Knicks star Karl-Anthony Towns was asked for his view of the play after the game.“What do you want me to say? View of what?” Towns said, smiling. “Going back to Madison Square Garden. Happy we got a win. You like that answer? Is that good?”Elsewhere on Sunday, Jaden McDaniels converted a three-point play with 39.5 seconds left for the lead and stole the ensuing inbounds pass from LeBron James, leading a rally by the Minnesota Timberwolves for a 116-113 win over the Los Angeles Lakers that put them up 3-1 in the first-round series.Meanwhile, the Boston Celtics went up 3-1 in their series against the Orlando Magic with a 107-98 victory. In Sunday’s late game, Myles Turner scored 23 points and the Indiana Pacers won 129-103 to grab a commanding 3-1 lead in their Eastern Conference playoff series with the Milwaukee Bucks, who lost Damian Lillard to a lower left leg injury.Explore more on these topicsNBADetroit PistonsNew York KnicksBasketballUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Although it is illegal to create or share a sexually explicit image of a child, the technology enabling them remains legal, the report noted.“Children have told me they are frightened by the very idea of this technology even being available, let alone used. They fear that anyone – a stranger, a classmate, or even a friend – could use a smartphone as a way of manipulating them by creating a naked image using these bespoke apps,” the commissioner, Dame Rachel de Souza, said.“The online world is revolutionary and quickly evolving, but there is no positive reason for these particular apps to exist. They have no place in our society. Tools using deepfake technology to create naked images of children should not be legal and I’m calling on the government to take decisive action to ban them, instead of allowing them to go unchecked with extreme real-world consequences.”De Souza urged the government to introduce an AI bill that would require developers of GenAI tools to address the risks their products pose, and to roll out effective systems to remove sexually explicit deepfake images of children. This should be underpinned by policymaking that recognises deepfake sexual abuse as a form of violence against women and girls, she suggested.In the meantime, the report urges Ofcom to ensure that age verification on nudification apps is properly enforced and that social media platforms prevent sexually explicit deepfake tools being promoted to children, in line with the Online Safety Act.The report cited a 2025 survey by Girlguiding, which found that 26% of respondents aged 13 to 18 had seen a sexually explicit deepfake image of a celebrity, a friend, a teacher, or themselves.Many AI tools appear to only work on female bodies, which the report warned is fuelling a growing culture of misogyny.One 18-year-old girl told the commissioner: “The narrative of Andrew Tate and influencers like that … backed by a quite violent and becoming more influential porn industry is making it seem that AI is something that you can use so that you can always pressure people into going out with you or doing sexual acts with you.”The report noted that there is a link between deepfake abuse and suicidal ideation and PTSD, for example in the case of Mia Janin, who died by suicide in March 2021.De Souza wrote in the report that the new technology “confronts children with concepts they cannot yet understand”, and is changing “at such scale and speed that it can be overwhelming to try and get a grip on the danger they present”.Lawyers told the Guardian that they were seeing this reflected in an increase in cases of teenage boys getting arrested for sexual offences because they did not understand the consequences of what they were doing, for example experimenting with deepfakes, being in a WhatsApp chat where explicit images are circulating, or looking up porn featuring children their own age.Danielle Reece-Greenhalgh, a partner at the law firm Corker Binning who specialises in sexual offences and possession of indecent images, said the law was “trying to keep up with the explosion in accessible deepfake technology”, which was already posing “a huge problem for law enforcement trying to identify and protect victims of abuse”.She noted that app bans were “likely to stir up debate around internet freedoms”, and could have a “disproportionate impact on young men” who were playing around with AI software unaware of the consequences.Reece-Greenhalgh said that although the criminal justice system tried to take a “commonsense view and avoid criminalising young people for crimes that resemble normal teenage behaviour … that might previously have happened behind a bike shed”, arrests could be traumatic experiences and have consequences at school or in the community, as well as longer-term repercussions such as needing to be declared on an Esta form to enter the US or showing up on an advanced DBS check.Matt Hardcastle, a partner at Kingsley Napley, said there was a “minefield for young people online” around accessing unlawful sexual and violent content. He said many parents were unaware how easy it was for children to “access things that take them into a dark place quickly”, for example nudification apps.“They’re looking at it through the eyes of a child. They’re not able to see that what they’re doing is potentially illegal, as well as quite harmful to you and other people as well,” he said. “Children’s brains are still developing. They have a completely different approach to risk-taking.”Marcus Johnstone, a criminal solicitor specialising in sexual offences, said he was working with an “ever-increasing number of young people” who were drawn into these crimes. “Often parents had no idea what was going on. They’re usually young men, very rarely young females, locked away in their bedrooms and their parents think they’re gaming,” he said. “These offences didn’t exist before the internet, now most sex crimes are committed online. It’s created a forum for children to become criminals.”A government spokesperson said:“Creating, possessing or distributing child sexual abuse material, including AI-generated images, is abhorrent and illegal. Under the Online Safety Act platforms of all sizes now have to remove this kind of content, or they could face significant fines.“The UK is the first country in the world to introduce further AI child sexual abuse offences, making it illegal to possess, create or distribute AI tools designed to generate heinous child sexual abuse material.”In the UK, the NSPCC offers support to children on 0800 1111, and adults concerned about a child on 0808 800 5000. The National Association for People Abused in Childhood (Napac) offers support for adult survivors on 0808 801 0331. In the US, call or text the Childhelp abuse hotline on 800-422-4453.

The report attempts to put a number to Musk’s many conflicts of interest through his work with his so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge), warning that he may seek to use his influence to avoid legal liability.The report, which waspublished on Mondayby Democratic members of the Senate homeland security committee’s permanent subcommittee on investigations, looked at 65 actual or potential actions against Musk across 11 separate agencies. Investigators calculated the financial liabilities Musk and his companies, such as Tesla, SpaceX and Neuralink, may face in 45 of those actions.US senator introduces conflict of interest bill aimed at Elon MuskRead moreSince Donald Trump won re-election last year and Musk took on the role of de facto head ofDogein January, ethics watchdogs and Democratic officials have warned that the Tesla CEO could use his power to oust regulators and quash investigations into his companies. In the role, Musk, the richest man in the world, holds sway over agencies that regulate or contract with his companies. The subcommittee report outlines the extent of Musk’s liabilities, which include potentially facing $1.19bn in fines to Tesla alone over allegations it made false or misleading statements about its autopilot and self-driving features.Although the report gives a total estimated amount, it also states that the $2bn-plus figure does not include how much Musk could avoid from investigations that the Trump administration declines to launch. It also excludes the potential contracts, such ascommunications dealswith his Starlink satellite internet service, that Musk’s companies could gain because of his role in the administration.“While the $2.37 billion figure represents a credible, conservative estimate, it drastically understates the true benefit Mr Musk may gain from legal risk avoidance alone as a result of his position in government,” the report states.TheTrump administrationhas downplayed concerns over Musk’s conflicts of interest in recent months, with the White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, stating in early February that he would “excuse himself” if there was any issue. Democrats havepressed the administration for answerson how Musk is addressing these conflicts, while also seeking to put theincreasingly unpopular billionaireat the forefront of their attacks against the Trump administration. The Democratic senator Jeanne Shaheen introduced a bill earlier this month targeting Musk that would prohibit awarding government contracts to companies owned by special government employees.“Despite numerous requests from members of Congress, the Trump Administration has failed to provide any relevant documents or information, the authorities relied upon for these actions, or an explanation of how Mr Musk is navigating the conflicts they inherently pose,” the report states.Musk’s conflicts span multiple agencies, including the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) which oversees SpaceX rocket launches and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), which has multiple open investigations into Tesla’s operations.

The ripples from Europe’s newfound desire for self-reliance could go even further: as far as space.Europe’s drive for more autonomy means it must also increase its invesment in space technology, according to Josef Aschbacher, director general of theEuropean Space Agency(Esa), the intergovernmental body tasked with overseeing the space exploration ambitions of European countries including much of the EU and the UK.“There are many domains that are seen in space as the ones where Europe will want to increase its autonomy, and it is crystal clear in a more volatile geopolitical situation the need for more autonomy is there,” Aschbacher said in an interview with the Guardian in London. “The situation is changing drastically.”Humans are turning their eyes to the skies more than ever. The world is in the middle of a second space race, with governments – and also private companies – taking advantage of huge advances in satellites, sensors and, crucially, rockets. Analyststalk of a $1tn industry, a scale that would match today’s airline sector, with Earth observation, communications, and even tourism expected to boom. The Trump-provoked increase in military spending could add further momentum, as armed forces vie for better spying gear.However, Aschbacher’s role as Esa boss is also to argue for continued investment in science to benefit humanity, including projects such as measuring wind speed using lasers, climate monitoring satellites, and the Euclid telescope, designed to explore the mysteries of dark matter.For European space science, close cooperation with the US has been vital for decades. The Esa works with American counterparts on projects ranging from putting astronauts on the International Space Station to the James Webb telescope, which is peering atradiation from galaxies billions of years ago, and the Artemis programme to return people to the moon. Aschbacher, an Austrian, controls a budget worth €7.7bn (£6.4bn) this year, a large amount, but dwarfed by the $25.4bn (£19.6bn) budget of the US’s National Aeronautics and Space Administration (Nasa).Trump’s return has raised questions over whether that cooperation will continue, as the USimposes steep cuts on Nasa.Elon Musk adds another complication. His SpaceX has already been perhaps the biggest contributor to therevolutionary decline in launch coststhanks to its reusable Falcon 9 rockets. Yet the billionaire’s highly controversial cost-cutting mandate under Trump means he is likely to wield significant influence over US space policy, despite the obvious risk of conflicts of interest as Nasa’s key contractor. Trump’s pick for Nasa administrator, the billionaireJared Isaacman, paid SpaceX to take him to space. Musk hascriticised Artemis, preferring instead his ambition to send people to Mars.European countries are also racing to wean themselves off SpaceX’s Starlink, a network of internet satellites in low-Earth orbit (Leo). Starlink has built by far the largest Leo constellation, giving reliable internet access in remote locations and becoming an indispensable part of Ukraine’s military communications since Russia’s 2022 invasion.View image in fullscreenElon Musk’s SpaceX launches Bandwagon-3 in April.Photograph: Joe Marino/UPI/REX/ShutterstockAsked about Musk’s influence, Aschbacher declined to comment on “the internal politics of the United States and who should influence these decisions”.The Esa is continuing with its part of the planned works, building the Orion capsule to transport astronauts, Aschbacher said, adding that he is “confident that the US will keep cooperating with Europe in the Artemis programme”, including in creating a “lunar gateway” orbiting the moon.“If changes happen and if our US partners and friends are changing their plans, of course we will be ready for plan B,” Aschbacher said. “And certainly we will reinforce our autonomy and our capacity as a consequence of it. But today is not the time to talk about plan B, because plan A is in place.”However, the Esa is also considering tie-ups with other countries who could be part of “plan B”. Aschbacher highlighted Australia, the United Arab Emirates and India as promising partners for Europe.SpaceX last month confirmed its dominant position when its Dragon capsule brought back four people, two of whom were stranded on the International Space Station aftertechnical issues on rival Boeing’s Starliner craft.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That amounted to a “launching crisis” that was only ended by the first flight of Arianespace’s Ariane 6 rocket last year.The Esa is now seeking to spur more launch competitors for the next generation, with a focus on reusable rockets to emulate SpaceX’s cost reductions. One Esa-led project, the Prometheus engine, should be able to launch in “less than a handful” of years, Aschbacher said. Other European private-sector players, such as German startup Rocket Factory Augsburg, are also in the race.If all goes to plan, they could also take off from the UK, ending the reliance on the Esa’sspaceport in French Guiana in South America. Aschbacher said the development of UK spaceports, most notablyone in Shetland, would be another welcome development. The Esa, funded by 23 member states, but is not an EU organisation, meaning Brexit has not stymied the UK’s involvement, although there was a hiatus in its part in the Copernicus climate satellite programme.The Esa’s role is to explore space peacefully, but the obvious military applications may make it easier for the agency to win increased funding from its member governments this November as they rush to rearm and fill the gap left by the US.Yet, Aschbacher is a scientist. He studied natural sciences at the University of Innsbruck and joined the Esa in 1990, rising through the ranks to lead its Earth Observation Division. Although he acknowledged that space technologies will “play a fundamental role in order to enable many of these security requirements” for European governments, he also called for continued investment in science.View image in fullscreenAstronauts Thomas Pesquet of France and Matthias Maurer of Germany at the opening of the new LUNA facility at the European Astronaut Center in Cologne, Germany.Photograph: Martin Meissner/APHe likened space investments to those into the fundamental research that allowed scientists to develop vaccines against Covid with astonishing speed during the pandemic.“Investments in space in Europe have to increase in order to make sure that Europe can sustain its standard of quality of life and standard of living for its people,” he said. “Science is such a strength of Europe.

But what are they and would a ban work?What are ‘nudification’ apps?Advances in artificial intelligence software have paved the way for the emergence of “nudification” tools, which are becoming easier to find on social media or search engines.These are apps and websites that produce deepfake nude images of real people using generative AI. This can involve removing clothes, getting an image to move suggestively, or pasting a head on to a naked body. The results often look highly realistic.AI tools create images by learning from, and replicating elements of, existing images. Nudification apps are thought to be trained on vast datasets of mostly female images because they tend to work most effectively on women’s bodies. As a result, 99% of sexually explicit deepfakes accessible online areestimatedto be of women and girls.Although it is illegal to possess AI-generated sexual content featuring children, the AI models that create these images are not illegal.How would a ban work?The children’s commissioner is asking the government to legislate to ban AI tools that are designed or marketed as “nudification” services.This could be achieved through a number of legal mechanisms.For example, one option would be through an amendment to the product safety and metrology bill that would ensure that providers of generative AI tools are required to carry out risk assessments for illegal and harmful activity, and to take reasonable steps to design that risk out of the product.This would mean that tools developed using generative AI models have to be risk-assessed for illegal and harmful activity before they are available in the UK. Nudification apps in their current form are not safe against illegal activity and will not be certified to be available in the UK.The second option is for the government to introduce an AI bill in this parliamentary session which would make it the responsibility of providers of generative AI models to prevent their use for nudifying children.Technology companies could be legally required to test their products against whether they can be used to nudify children before launching them in the UK market, and held to account if their models are used for this purpose.However, critics of a ban may challenge it on internet freedom grounds, said Danielle Reece-Greenhalgh, a partner at the London law firm Corker Binning. She said it could be difficult to enforce as AI models improve, making it even harder to distinguish between “real” and “AI” created material.What powers does the Online Safety Act contain?The children’s commissioner does not believe that the Online Safety Act contains the provisions required to fully protect children from harm.However, she notes that in the meantime, the risk can be partially mitigated through Ofcom’s implementation of the act.As providers of sexually explicit or pornographic material, nudification services fall under its scope. They are required to verify that users are aged over 18 before allowing them access to content. However, this would not stop adults from making images of children.Ofcom could also strengthen its provisions to protect children from harm by ensuring it is proactive in identifying emerging harms.Social media companies are required to carry out risk assessments to comply with the Online Safety Act. This should require them to identify and mitigate the risk to children of content produced by sexually explicit deepfake tools, including content used to promote them.The report also asks the government to provide more support for children to report an intimate image – including false ones that have been created using AI – that has been shared in a public online space, and to get it removed. It could ask Ofcom to require technology companies to embed “report remove” tools.The report also suggests that sexually explicit deepfake technology be included on PSHE (personal, social, health and economic) curriculums.Explore more on these topicsInternet safetyEnglandChildrenSmartphonesexplainersShareReuse this content"

Based on analysis fromNationwide Vehicle Contracts, using figures from the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA) 2023-24, the average wait time for a test is 19.92 weeks, with a pass rate of 33.9%.In an effort to address the backlog, the government has pledged to add thousands moredriving examseach month.After taking 29 lessons with Evans and 20 before that elsewhere, Calvin said it took almost three months to find an available test date. The DVSA does offerguidancefor individuals attempting to navigate the site when booking a test.It’s a similar situation for Calvin’s friends as learner drivers can wait months for an available slot. “They’re just really upset that they can’t even find a test,” he said. “They’ve put so many hours into practising for their theory, and when it’s time to find a test date: it’s nearly impossible.”For Calvin, it’ll cost £80 to take the test, as well as £62 in additional fees to use his instructor’s car and have a lesson beforehand. For some it will cost a lot more because of a shadow trade of booking bots buying open slots and then selling them on at aninflated rate.Evans, who instructs roughly 30 pupils in the region, stated that the earliest time she can next schedule a test for another learner is in September. She has heard instances where students have paid £150 for tests elsewhere, when the standard fee was £62.Other factors that contribute to these delays, according to Evans, are the shortages of examiners; sickness of examiners and no one to cover their tests as well as weather conditions on the day.Record number of UK drivers pass test first time with zero faults, figures showRead moreEvans is sceptical of the government’s plans to tackle the backlog. “Who’s going to be doing these tests? They haven’t got enough examiners now,” she said. “So brilliant if they can, but we’ll see.”Seb Goldin, the chief executive of RED Driver Training welcomed this week’s government announcement. “What they’re doing with the changes around overtime rates and ways of getting more examiners available is brilliant,” he said.Goldin added that booking bots were problematic for two reasons. “It is putting students in a position where they feel that they have to overpay for tests,” he said, but the shortage is also encouraging people to buy tests in advance and then try to prepare for the test date. He strongly advised learners to wait and only book a test when they feel ready to do so.Explore more on these topicsMotoringWolverhamptonfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The arrest, a highly publicized and dramatic move from the Trump administration, seemed designed to elicit fear among judges, government bureaucrats and ordinary Americans that any effort to slow, impede or merely not facilitate the administration’s mass kidnapping and deportation efforts will lead to swift, forceful and disproportionate punishment by Donald Trump allies. Her arrest may be the opening salvo of a broader Trump assault on judges.Even if you believe the FBI’s allegations,their accountof Dugan’s alleged misconduct is trivial and flimsy, wholly undeserving of the administration’s sadistically disproportionate response. The FBI claims that earlier this month, on 17 April, when an undocumented man was in Dugan’s Milwaukee courtroom charged with misdemeanor battery, she learned that Ice agents were waiting in a public hallway to arrest him. Later, in her courtroom, when she saw the defendant moving toward a main exit, she told the man, “Wait, come with me,” and directed him towards a side door instead. (He was captured by Ice shortly thereafter.) The FBI arrested her in her courtroom and has indicted her on two federal felony charges: obstruction and “concealing an individual”.The presence of Ice agents looking to abduct, detain and deport various undocumented people has long been a problem in local courthouses, keeping municipalities from interacting officially with their residents and slowing the pace of court business as undocumented people have become reluctant to show up at courthouse buildings, be it to face criminal charges, as the man in Dugan’s case was doing; to tend to civil matters; or to report crimes or pursue restraining orders against abusers. As a result, many local judges and administrators have criticized Ice’s operation policies, alleging that the agency’s aggressive tactics to enforce federal immigration law have obstructed their own ability to enforce local law. This is a distinct issue from the legality of Trump administration’simmigrationcrackdown tactics, which have also been challenged by a number of judges at the state and local level. The justice departmenthas reportedly encouraged federal prosecutorsto press charges against state and local officials who oppose the administration’s immigration policies.Donald Trump, beware – this is what a global liberal fightback looks like  | Timothy Garton AshRead moreAt the Milwaukee courthouse where Dugan works, Ice agents had already madetwo high-profile arrestsof undocumented persons there to conduct official business, actions that sent a chilling effect through the local community. (The defendant in question in Dugan’s court that day was there on a domestic violence charge; because Ice decided to appear there to arrest him on civil immigration charges instead, the proceedings had to be abruptly halted. The victims, who were present in the courtroom, did not get their chance to see justice served.) When she learned of the presence of Ice agents outside her courtroom door, the FBI alleges, Judge Dugan asked the Ice agents to leave, and pointed out that they did not have the correct warrants. She also allegedly called the situation “absurd”.The absurdity was only beginning. After capturing Dugan’s defendant, theTrump administrationevidently sought to make an example of Dugan, and concocted the trumped-up felony charges in order to criminalize her objection to their presence in her courthouse. After orchestrating her arrest, the FBI’s embattled chief, Kash Patel, tweeted gloatingly about Dugan’s capture; then, he quickly deleted the post, only to put it up again later. The FBI seems to have procedurally expedited the charges against her, having her indictment issued by a magistrate judge rather than a grand jury, and arresting Dugan rather than giving her the opportunity to turn herself in. They seem to have been going for maximum drama. For her part, Dugan – a well-known progressive in Milwaukee legal circles who spent much of her career working as a public-interest legal aid attorney – said nothing at her arraignment on Friday. Her attorney told the press, “Judge Dugan wholeheartedly rejects and protests her arrest,” adding: “It was not made in the interest of public safety.”Indeed it was not. Instead, Dugan’s arrest was made in the interest of shoring up the Trump administration’s depictions of itself as lawless, fearsome and impervious to constitutional checks on its own power. It was made in the interest of intimidating the administration’s critics and opponents. And it was made in the interest of silencing dissent.The Trump administration has been rapidly accumulating political prisoners. It began with immigrants who voiced opposition to Israel’s genocide in Gaza: Mahmoud Khalil and Rümeysa Öztürk, the graduate students who had their legal status revoked in retaliation for their pro-Palestinian opinions and who were kidnapped by the Ice secret police and shipped off to faraway prisons without process, are political prisoners. Dugan’s, too, is a political prosecution: what is at stake is not so much the law that that meager little comment – “Wait, come with me” – supposedly broke. Instead, it is that Dugan opposes the Trump mass deportation project, and she voiced that opposition in public. Her arrest is an expansion of the Trump regime’s determination into who can be made a political prisoner: with Dugan, that designation extends, in public fashion, to citizens, and even to judges. You should expect that it can expand to you.Dugan’s example is meant to frighten Americans into submission. But I think it might be more likely that she inspires us to subversion. Legality and morality are different things, and what Dugan allegedly did, whether or not it was technically legal, was supremely moral, and not a little bit brave: she refused to cooperate with a secret police force that was there to violate her courtroom, disappear her defendant, and interfere with her own distribution of justice. Doing the morally right thing – opposing Ice and mass deportations with our actions, in practical terms – will require courage from more and more of us, and a greater and greater willingness to face consequences for it.Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsTrump administrationOpinionUS immigrationUS politicsDonald TrumpLaw (US)MilwaukeeWisconsincommentShareReuse this content"

But during a recentinterviewwith this newspaper, Henna Virkkunen, the European Union’s most senior official on digital policy, was in bullish mood. “We are very committed to our rules when it comes to the digital world,” said Ms Virkkunen, who is the EU vice-president responsible for tech sovereignty. “We want to make sure that our digital environment … is fair and it’s safe and it’s also democratic.”Last week, words were followed by deeds. In the first sanctions handed down since the establishment of the EU’s Digital Markets Act, the European CommissionfinedApple €500m and Meta €200m, after finding them guilty of unfair business practices that exploited their entrenched online “gatekeeper” position. Apple, for example, was judged to have unfairly restricted developers from distributing apps outside its own App Store, where it takes a cut from sales.Tough action or tokenism? It is safe to say these fines will not keep either company’s accountants up at night. Apple’srevenuelast year was €344bn. There are also indications that, in other areas, Brussels may be seeking to dial down tensions with the US tech giants as it seeks to avoid a full-on trade war with Washington.A separateinvestigationinto X under the auspices of the Digital Services Act – which deals with content moderation – last summer found it in preliminary breach of EU rules, following Mr Musk’s takeover in 2022. No fine has yet resulted. Meanwhile there are growing fears that EU regulations on artificial intelligence, intended to lessen the risk of disinformation and political manipulation, are in danger of being watered down underpressurefrom the Trump administration.The current volatility of transatlantic relations is such that a degree of cautious restraint is understandable. But US bullying of Brussels over its regulation of big tech on behalf of EU citizens must be robustly resisted. Mr Trump’s senior adviser for trade and manufacturing, Peter Navarro, hasmischaracterisedEuropean digital regulation as a non-tariff barrier and form of “lawfare” against American companies. The reality is more mundane: US market dominance means its tech giants will inevitably be the most affected by efforts to govern a space that is now part of the architecture of everyday life.That task, vital to maintaining a healthy public sphere, should be kept distinct from fraught trade negotiations with the White House. Easier said than done perhaps, given Mr Trump’s all-embracing mercantilism. But EU politicians (and British ones) must not be intimidated into an ill-judged deregulatory path with potentially damaging implications for democracy.Last week’s fines might have been small beer financially but they at least represented a necessary statement of intent. Alongside its investigation into X, the commission has inquiries ongoing into TikTok and Meta, also relating to content moderation. MEPs are nowcallingfor those too to be pushed to a conclusion.This may be the acid test. The US vice-president, JD Vance, has made it clear that the White House intends to act as the political wing of US big tech,comparingEuropean attempts to combat online disinformation and illegal content to Soviet-era censorship. Ms Verkkunen should stick to her guns, and ignore the flak flying from Washington.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

You come out of a stubby 1930s entrance hall that must have been cute once, right on to a dual carriageway. There’s a hotel on the other side of the road, and a tourist will most likely approach you, asking how she’s supposed to cross, and your answer will be just a sub-verbal collapse into nothingness. There is no obvious way to cross the road. This place was built for cars, and if you’re not a car, you’re stuck in a tube station now. There is actually an underpass, but that’s no excuse for dystopian urban planning.I was there helping the Stop Trump Coalition make a video before theUS president’s state visit, whenever that might be, and they were there to seeTesla Takedown, which is not as antagonistic as it sounds, just a score of people, one dressed as a shark for some reason, holding signs that said: “Honk if you hate billionaires.” Tesla drivers were honking as they drove into the showroom. It wasn’t the easiest thing to guess, a year ago, that you were buying an ad for the values of Elon Musk, nor what those values would transpire to be.‘A trickle to a tidal wave’: behind the Trump protest movement that launched on RedditRead moreEveryone honked: big cars, small cars; rich people, not rich people; an Ocado van. An ambulance put its siren on. Was this a movement building? “The feedback mechanism of a honk is quite ephemeral, isn’t it?” said an anthropologist who had declined to be interviewed. But hah, he shouldn’t have kept talking to me.It was the smallest protest I’d ever seen, unless you count the Prettiest Staffy in Lewisham beauty pageant, organised by someone to low-key protest against the vilification of staffordshire bull terriers. But those on it – US progressives, a woman from Ukraine who has lived in the UK since before the Russians invaded, an anti-Brexit campaigner who had brought his EU flag – should have been the most politically depressed people you could meet, whereas in fact, they were the least.The true mechanism of a honk is that it buoys the spirit, for ages, possibly for ever.Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Being a “low-IQ individual” is a standard insult in the president’s repertoire, and being “high-IQ” is an equally standard form of praise for those on the tech right. Yet in the drive for US supremacy in artificial intelligence – signalled by the $500bn (£375bn)Stargate project announcementin the White House and an executive order tointegrateAI into public education, beginning in kindergarten – there is a hidden irony. If their vision for our economic future is realised, IQ in the sense that they value will lose its meaning.IQ testing arose at a time when the US and other industrialised nations were worried about the health of their populations. Recruitment campaigns for the Boer war in the UK, and then the first world war elsewhere, showed male populations that were unhealthier than their fathers’ generation. Industrial work seemed to be triggering what looked like a process of degeneration, with a fearful endpoint in the subterranean Morlocks of HG Wells’s classic novella, The Time Machine. Intelligence tests were a way to salvage the diamonds from the rough and find a new officer class – and later a new elite – to guide mass society from the slough of despond into a braver future.When manufacturing still ruled in the US, IQ was valued as a way of measuring educational outcomes, but arguably it was not until the breakthrough of the information economy in the 1980s and 90s that knowledge workers became indisputably the vanguard of future prosperity. It is no coincidence that IQ talk surged in the 1990s, first through Charles Murray and Richard Herrnstein’s infamous book, The Bell Curve, which suggested there were long-term and insurmountable gaps in IQ between racial groups, and second, more subtly through gifted and talented search programmes in the US that found kids and plucked them from public schools into supercharged summer programmes for the bright.One such person was Curtis Yarvin, the middle-aged software engineer and amateur political theorist who hasdrawnattentionfor his techno-monarchistphilosophyand whose work has beenpositively citedby the US vice-president, JD Vance. As a youngster, Yarvin was part of Julian Stanley’s Center for Talented Youth. From the early 2000s to the present, he has been a consistent advocate for the importance of IQ as a measure of human worth. In the late 2000s, as an exponent of what came to be called the Dark Enlightenment, or “neo-reaction”, he suggested IQ tests could be used to disqualify voters in post-apartheid South Africa.Yarvin’s IQ fetishism was an organic outgrowth of the intellectual subculture of Silicon Valley. People who manipulated symbols and wrote code all day not surprisingly put special stock into the “general intelligence” measured by IQ, which gauged the proximity of minds to computers defined by logic, memory and processing speed.IQ fetishism had a history in the valley; one of the pioneers of the need to take eugenic measures to increase IQ was William Shockley, the inventor of the transistor (the building block of computer chips), who proposed that people with an IQ below the average of 100 should be given$1,000 per IQ pointto sterilise themselves. In 2014, the American tech billionaire Peter Thielsaidthe problem with the Republican party was that too many of its leaders were “lower IQ” compared with those in the Democratic party. IQ was also a common focus of discussion on the popular blog Slate Star Codex and elsewhere in the so-called “rationalist” community.All of this would have remained a quirky symptom of San Francisco Bay Area chatboards were it not for the recent alliance between the world of the tech right and the governing party in Washington DC. The idea that intelligence is hardwired and resistant to early intervention or improvement through state programmes – that IQ is meaningful and real – brings us closer to what Murray and Herrnstein were advocating for in The Bell Curve in the 1990s, what they called “living with inequality”.The US Department of Education was set up in 1980 on a premise opposite to that of The Bell Curve. It worked on the belief that early interventions are crucial for brain development and that measuring outcomes was necessary to fine-tune interventions so that educational testing could produce more even results across the US. This department is in the process of being dismantled by Elon Musk’s “department of government efficiency”, with the former World Wrestling Entertainment chief executive Linda McMahon promising to complete the task. Musk, like Trump, frequently refers to IQ as if it is a meaningful and important number. If you believe it is hardwired, then you too would want to destroy the Department of Education and stop trying to create standardised outcomes.People have cast around for ways to characterise the ideology that links the west coast of tech entrepreneurs and founders to the north-east and midwest of tycoons and conservatives around the Maga coalition. One way to see it is as a return to nature, a flight to a belief in implacable truths around intelligence, gender and race in the face of a changing world.Yet here’s the rub. That same coalition has bet the future of the US economy on breakthrough developments in artificial intelligence. To date, generative AI is primarily a means of automating away many of the very white-collar jobs that had previously been the heart of the knowledge economy. ChatGPT, its cheerleaders claim, can code better than a Stanford computer science graduate. It can make slides, take minutes and draft talking points quicker than any product of an elite liberal arts college. It can discover protein structures faster than any top hire from MIT. The argument in favour of paying attention to IQ was that, unfair or not, it was a ticket on to the escalator of upward mobility and meritocracy associated with jobs in finance, tech, advertising and even public service or higher education. If those jobs are whittled down to a nub, then on its own terms, the point of caring about IQ vanishes as well.As Musk has said himself, “we are all extremely dumb” compared with the “digital super intelligence” that he is helping to build through initiatives such as his model at xAI, whichrecently boughtthe social media platform X. The Silicon Valley venture capitalist Marc Andreessen wrote once that software was eating the world. If their predictions are true, it will eat the right’s precious IQ too.Quinn Slobodian’s latest book is Hayek’s Bastards: Race, Gold, IQ, and the Capitalism of the Far RightDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But he is just as easily swayed by the elevator doormanMon 28 Apr 2025 07.24 EDTLast modified on Mon 28 Apr 2025 12.03 EDTShareThe most recent diplomatic effort to find a way to stop Russia’s invasion ofUkrainetook place at the most unlikely of events: the funeral of Pope Francis. The image of Presidents Zelenskyy and Trump leaning toward each other, under Carlo Maratta’s late-17th-century painting, The Baptism of Christ, rekindled hopes that the US might, at last, hear Kyiv out. Would this unexpected setting make Trump’s compassion, so frequently expressed for the loss of human life, real? And could it lead to a better strategy for ending this criminal and brutal war?The goal of Kyiv and the coalition of the willing – a group of 31 nations that back Ukraine in its fight against Russia – is to distance Trump from what has become a dangerous rapprochement between the Washington and Moscow. But this will be an uphill battle –Europeand Kyiv are trying to fight their way to Trump’s ear just when the US is backing Russia’s position.The most recent blow has been Trump’s willingness to recognise the annexation of Crimea and to explicitly veto Ukraine’s membership of Nato. The US’sseven-point planto end the war, presented to Kyiv and its allies in Paris last week, came alongside secretary of state Marco Rubio’s promise to abandon the talks and focus on other global issues if progress wasn’t made quickly. And yet, the US has made no movement toward guaranteeing implementation of a deal or providing deterrence against Russia having another go.Hope can lift the spirit, but it’s not a good strategy. Trump’s second term has torpedoed the world order, in a manner that is especially dangerous for Ukraine and the rest of Europe. Three factors make the diplomatic efforts to defend Europe and achieve a good outcome in Ukraine precarious.Trump says he thinks Zelenskyy is ready to give up Crimea despite previous commentsRead moreFirst, the disturbing alignment in worldview between the White House and the Kremlin. Both Trump and Putin believe the world is a superpowers’ playground, where the powerful do what they choose, and the smaller do what they must. Power is expressed as coercion and military might. Their geopolitical agendas can be achieved at the expense of other nations and territories, be they Ukraine or Greenland, inviolation of the UN charter.Trump has already validated Putin’s fabricated narrative that the war was provoked by the west and Ukraine is a culprit. In opposition to the free world, it has voted with Russia, North Korea and Belarus three times on various UN resolutions concerning the war.In March, the US Department of Justice pulled out of the international body investigating the Russian crime of aggression in Ukraine.Second, Trump’s erratic decision-making makes it hard for Ukraine’s European allies to work on a coordinated plan of their own. The feeling is that Trump will pursue not what is good for peace and stability, but whatever the last person he spoke to told him. One former business associaterecallshis fear of strategies being upset by the last thing Trump would hear from the doorman operating an elevator.It is positive that Zelenskyy and other large European state leaders, Keir Starmer and Emmanuel Macron, were able to speak with Trump in the Vatican. Their main message was likely “do not trust Putin when he says he is interested in peace, while he keeps waging war”. In recent weeks Ukraine’s top generalconfirmedthat a new Russian offensive near Kharkiv and Sumy had begun. Ukraine has insisted on a total, unconditional ceasefire for any serious talks to begin.Russia claims it is ‘ready’ for Ukraine talks but demands recognition of occupied territories – Europe liveRead moreAnd it seems that Vatican diplomacy had at least some temporary effect. On Saturday, Trumppublicly doubtedPutin’s intentions and threatened Russia with secondary sanctions if there is no deal. The last time he mentioned sanctioning Russiawas in January, but no action followed.But what if Trump’s envoy, Steve Witkoff, just back from his fourth visit to Moscow, produces the “doorman effect” and persuades Trump to continue his policy of appeasement?Russia is trying to lure the USwith business and geopolitical deals. The most personal project is the 150-storey Trump Tower in the centre of Moscow. The Kremlin has managed to have some of its most outrageous narratives voiced in the White House. It may be just a matter of time before Trump agrees to lift all US sanctions on Russia in order to do business together – and push Europe to follow suit.This brings us to the third and final reason to distrust Trumpian diplomacy: the American president loves to exercise power for the sake of it, not to engage in policymaking with clear strategic outcomes. By sidelining Europe and Ukraine and engaging in direct talks withRussia, Trump is showing his might. He believes Europe cannot defend itself against Russia without the US at the moment. This gives him power. And he also believes Ukraine depends on US intelligence and military aid, especially Patriot missiles for air defence. Being at the high table with Putin, signing a ceasefire, is also a show of power, regardless of whether the deal lasts and brings peace and justice.With such an unreliable leader in the White House, Europe simply cannot count on the US to have its back and help defend Ukraine. It is dangerous to hope that it can win the tug of war for Trump’s favour over Russia. While the talks continue, Europe must prepare for its standoff with Russia alone. Those talks may buy time, but they will not replace the urgent need for credible investment in defence to counter Russia.Orysia Lutsevych is deputy director of the Russia and Eurasia programme and head of the Ukraine forum at Chatham HouseExplore more on these topicsUkraineOpinionDonald TrumpVolodymyr ZelenskyyRussiaVladimir PutinEuropecommentShareReuse this content"

On Broadway, crowds lingered, enjoying “flaring skies” that remained undimmed by city lights. The following morning, excess electric currents shut down the New York Central Railroad’s signal and switching system in Manhattan, stopping trains. A fire broke out in a railroad control tower that was located at Park Avenue and 57th Street. Smoke filled the air. Along a stretch of Park Avenue, residents “were coughing and chokingfrom the suffocating vapors which spread for blocks”.When a solar storm’s electrically charged particles envelop Earth, they cause geomagnetic storms that generate electric fields in the ground, inducing electric currents in power grids. Solar storms as intense as the 1921 superstorm have the potential to cause a nightmare scenario in which modern power grids, communication systems, and other infrastructurescollapse for months. Such a collapse of power grids would likely also lead to nuclear power plant accidents, whose radioactive emissions would aggravate the overall catastrophe.Scientists estimate that solar storms powerful enough tocollapseportions of modern power grids for months may hit Earthmore often than once in a century. In July 2012, a solar superstorm, estimated to have been more intense than the New York Railroad storm,crossed Earth’s orbit, missing the planet by one week’s time.The east coast states, upper midwest, and Pacific north-west havegeological characteristics– not predominant in other regions of the United States – that increase the vulnerability of power-grid infrastructures to solar storms. Unfortunately, the majority of thecommercial nuclear power plants in the United Statesare located in east coast states and the upper midwest, two of the US regions that are most vulnerable to solar storm-induced blackouts.In a months-long blackout, nuclear plants would lose their supply of offsite electricity, which is necessary for their safe operation. Emergency diesel generators, which provide backup electricity, are designed to power cooling pumps for a number of days – not months. No nuclear plant in the United States has ever lost offsite electricity forlonger than a week. In 2012, the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission stated that an extreme solar storm could collapse power grids and potentially lead to reactor core damage atmultiple nuclear plants.The nuclear industry’s mismanagement of spent fuel must stopStorage pools at nuclear plants that house spent fuel assemblies, encasing nuclear waste, are also vulnerable to accidents.Spent fuel assemblies can overheat and catch fire, dispersing radioactive material into the environment, if a storage pool’s coolant water is lost.Spent fuel assemblies are so thermally hot and radioactive that they must be submerged in circulating water and cooled in a storage pool foryears. Storage pools at US nuclear plants typically contain aboutsix reactor core loadsof nuclear fuel and are almost as densely packed with fuel assemblies as operating reactors – hazards thatvastly increase the odds of a major accident.A spent fuel fire in an exposed, densely packed storage pool could potentially release10 times as much caesium-137as the Chornobyl accident is estimated to have released. Such a disaster could contaminate thousands of square miles of land and expose millions of people to large doses of ionizing radiation, many of whom mightdie from early or latent cancer.By contrast, if a thinly packed storage pool were deprived of coolant water, its spent fuel would likely release about1% of the radioactive materialestimated to be released by a spent fuel fire at a densely packed pool.Sufficiently cooled spent fuel assemblies can betransferredfrom a storage pool to dry cask storage; that is, passively cooled, liquid-free containers of steel and concrete that shield people from ionizing radiation. The inevitability of a nationwide power grid collapse that would lead to multiple nuclear disasters and untold human suffering emphasizes the need to transfer spent fuel assemblies to dry cask storage as quickly as possible.Promptly transferring the nationwide inventories of spent fuel assemblies that have been cooled for at least five years from US storage pools to dry cask storage would be “relatively inexpensive” –less than a total of $5.5bn. The economic cost of losing vast tracts of urban and rural land for generations to come because of radioactive contamination would be far more expensive.Senator Edward Markey of Massachusetts introducedthe Dry Cask Storage Actin 2014, calling to outlaw the practice of overloading spent fuel pools. The act, which Markey has reintroduced in subsequent congressional sessions, has not passed into law. The nuclear industry’s mismanagement of spent fuel must stop. Congress needs to pass legislation requiring the owners of nuclear plants to swiftly thin out spent fuel pools.Mark Leyse is a nuclear power safety advocateExplore more on these topicsEnergyOpinionUS politicsNuclear powerUS weathercommentShareReuse this content"

So many seem powered by ignorance and incoherence, by capriciousness and callousness. With their sociopathic desire to disrupt anything and everything, the presidentand his top henchman,Elon Musk, seem eager to pulverize the foundations of our government, our democracy, our alliances and our notions of truth. In just 100 days, Trump’s new term has shown itself to be the most lawless and authoritarian in US history.The most dangerous part of Trump’s agenda is his war against our democracy and constitution –defyingjudges’orders,deporting peoplewithout due process,pardoninghundreds of January 6 criminals, calling toimpeach judgeswho rule against him,suggestinghe will runfor a third term, using federal agencies totake vengeanceagainst his perceived enemies, and banningbooks from military libraries. Underlining his contempt for the rule of law, Trump has even talked aboutdisappearing US citizensto foreign prisons where they could be locked up for ever. For anyone who cares about democracy and basic liberties, this is Defcon 1 stuff.Trump’s an unstable bully – but it’s hard to defend the economic orthodoxies he is attacking | Larry ElliottRead moreEvery previous president since the second world war – from Franklin Roosevelt to Ronald Reagan to Joe Biden – worked hard to build alliances to promote peace and deter aggression. But second-term Trump has rushed to lay waste to the US’s bipartisan foreign policy: he has enthusiastically embraced Vladimir Putin, a brutal dictator, and undercut Ukraine in its fight against Russian aggression. Trump showed our allies once again that he couldn’t be trusted when he disgracefullyaccused Ukraine of starting the warwith Russia.Trump sounds like a rapacious 19th century imperialist when he threatens to use force totake over the Panama canalandseize control of Greenland. Then there’s his idiotic taunt thatCanada should be the 51st US state. What a way to insult and infuriate the US’s best friend. And let’s not forget Trump’s astonishingly callous proposal to empty Gaza of all Palestinians and turn it into “the Riviera of the Mideast” (presumably with Trump hotels).Many business executives who backed Trump are feeling buyers’ remorse because of his disastrous on-again, off-again, it-may-all-change-tomorrow tariff scheme. Trump and his clown car of advisers seemed to have no idea that his tariffs would send the world’s stock markets into a nervous breakdown. Trump and team were foolish enough to believe that China was too feeble to respond to Trump’s trade war, with the treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, saying China held “a losing hand” withjust “a pair of twos”. Trump – whohatesto bebriefed– utterly failed to realize that China could retaliate in devastating ways, for instance, by curbing rare earth exports that US manufacturers desperately need. The former treasury secretary,Janet Yellen, calledTrump’s tariff debacle “the worst self-inflicted policy wound I’ve ever seen … inflicted on our economy”.Trump’s economic stewardship has been so inept that many economists are predicting arecession this year, with some saying it has already begun – a stunning contrast to early this year when they said there was no way the US would slide into recession anytime soon.Consumerandbusiness confidencehave plummeted.With such an erratic, economically illiterate man at the US’s helm, global investors are souring on the USand the dollaras never before.Nervous bond investorsare asking whether the US will make good on its debts – a fear that has caused interest rates to jump, hurting millions of Americans. Convinced that Trump is dragging the US down, not lifting it up, many investors are questioning the dollar’s primacy and whether it should remain theworld’s reserve currency– a privileged position that gives the US many advantages. Trump has in effect downgraded the US and the dollar.Trump seems more myopic than Mr Magoo. More than any president in memory, Mr. Make America Great Again is pushing policies that will harm our country long-term. The US has many of the world’s greatest universities, famed for their scientific breakthroughs and Nobel prizes, but Trump seems intent on squashing leading universities and crippling their research programs unless they submit to his dictates. Trump’s brutalcuts at the National Institutes of Healthwill set back research and discoveries on cancer and many vital medicines for years to come. His animosity towards immigrants will discourage many brilliant foreign students from studying in the US; in the past many of those students contributed mightily to research and start-up businesses here. The US’s – and the world’s – environment will suffer greatly because of Trump’s strange affection for fossil fuels and his childish refusal to admit that global heating is a reality. His executive order to ban federal agencies fromusing paper strawsdeserves a spot atop the Pantheon of Presidential Pettiness.Is a US recession on the horizon amid Trump’s tariffs? | Jeffrey FrankelRead moreI strain to think of one good thing Trump has done. His party’s trillions inplanned tax cutsbenefitting the rich? No. Hisgutting the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which protects typical Americans against financial scams? No. His closing down various offices thatinvestigate government corruption? No. His firingtens of thousandsof dedicated federal employees who serve the public? No. His and Congress’ plan to potentiallycut $1tnfrom Medicaid and food stamps, which help tens of millions of struggling Americans? No. As for Trump’s campaign vow to reduce food prices and cut auto insurance and energy prices in half, no, that’s not happening. The only laudable Trump action I can think of is his push to reach a nuclear deal with Iran, but he’s doing that only because he impulsively blew up Barack Obama’s smoothly running nuclear deal with Iran.I often argue with a good friend about who was the worst president in US history – Trump or James Buchanan.Buchanan was indeed a terrible president, helping to engineer the horrendous Dred Scott decision and set the stage for the civil war. But Buchanan inherited a largely untenable situation with tensions boiling between free states and states with slavery.In contrast, Trump took over a nation in excellent shape. It’s the world’s richest and strongest country. When Trump’s second term began, the US had the fastest-growing economy among advanced industrial nations (with unemployment low, inflation way down and manufacturing rebounding). It was a magnet for people from across the globe, with many of the greatest universities.Trump has felt a perverse need to trash the US because his insatiable ego demands that he be able to claim, however falsely, that he made America great again. It’s hard to deny, though, that second-term Trump is making America less great. He’s taking a wrecking ball to our democracy, rule of law, alliances and scientific research – the list goes on. Trump 2.0 means decline, not greatness.After Trump’s first term, a poll of 154 historians ranked Trump as theworst US president ever, even behind Buchanan. But with Trump unbound, with the guardrails off, with no adults in the room, Trump’s second term is shaping up to be far worse than his “worst-in-history” first term.Trump’s Maga movement should perhaps be renamed Manga – making America not great again.Steven Greenhouse is a journalist and author focusing on labor and the workplace, as well as economic and legal issuesExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionUS politicsTrump administrationUS foreign policyUS domestic policycommentShareReuse this content"

Not any moreKai FalkenbergThe Trump administration is creating a chilling effect on independent reporting and public dissentMon 28 Apr 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 28 Apr 2025 11.31 EDTShareThis week is World Press Freedom Day. That used to be a time when we pointed fingers at governments that kept journalists from doing their jobs – places like Turkey, where reporters are imprisoned for libel, or Saudi Arabia, where government censorship is a part of daily life. From our privileged perch here in the US, we highlighted the struggle of journalists suffering under authoritarian rule. But this year, the ones suffocating aren’t halfway around the world – they’re right here at home.In my 20 years as a media lawyer, I’ve always seen the United States as the gold standard for press freedom – a model admired by journalists around the world. But in just a few short months, theTrump administrationhas severely undermined those protections, creating a chilling effect on independent reporting and public dissent. Today, the White House is waging an increasingly hostile campaign against the press, pushing to control coverage in ways that go far beyond anything we saw during the president’s first term.Borrowing tactics from press-repressive regimes, the attacks have come from all sides – billion-dollar lawsuits, government investigations, blocked access and outright withdrawal of funding. All of it is unfolding at a time when public trust in the media is at an all-time low, emboldening juries to hand down record-breaking verdicts.Trump haslong used lawsuitsto intimidate the press, but what has changed is the judicial landscape. He has appointed over a quarter of all active federal judges, and he has been strategic in making sure cases targeting the media end up in courtrooms that lean his way.The AP’s win against Trump shows principles still have power in America | Margaret SullivanRead moreTake his$20bnlawsuit against CBS News, for example – a staggering figure tied to how 60 Minutes edited its interview with Kamala Harris. He claims the segment defrauded viewers in Texas under the state’s consumer protection laws. So why file in Texas? The case was brought in Amarillo, a district with just one judge – and yes, he’s a Trump appointee.It’s a far-fetched, fantastical claim – yet CBS is reportedly considering amediated settlement. Why back down from a case they could probably win? It’s a cold, calculated decision – one that others in Trump’s crosshairs have also made. Just weeks after his election,ABC News settleda defamation suit with him for $16m. It was a defensible case. But Disney, ABC’s parent company, knew any major business deal over the next four years would need the administration’s blessing. So they did the math: better to stay in the good graces of a president known for holding grudges than risk jeopardizing future profits.It wasn’t just Trump they feared – it was the prospect of facing a Florida jury. After years of Trump branding legitimate investigative reporting as “fake news”, we now have a deeply polarized country where juries can be swayed by political rhetoric, posing real threats to the survival of major news outlets.In a recent libel case against CNN, filed in a Florida district that overwhelmingly voted for Trump, thetrial foreshadowedwhat his promised crackdown on the press would look like in his second term. The plaintiff’s argument echoed Trump’s relentless attacks on the press, urging jurors to punish the so-called “lamestream” media.It takes real courage to keep holding power to account in the face of growing legal threatsAfter an unfavorable ruling on liability, CNN ultimatelydecided to settle, afraid of what the jury might do. When the case ended, the jury forewoman revealed she would have pushed for$100m in damageshad the trial continued. A verdict that large would have caused serious harm – and there was nothing in the case that justified it.Beyond the risk of huge jury verdicts, several news organizations are now under government scrutiny.Comcast,VerizonandDisneyare all facing FCC investigations over allegedly unlawful diversity, equity and inclusion practices. Companies likeYahooandGannetthave already begun rolling back their diversity initiatives. Meanwhile, executive orders targeting law firms raise seriousfree speech concerns, sending a chilling message to attorneys who might otherwise support or work with the press.That support has never been more essential. In a blatant attempt to shape media coverage, the White Housebanned Associated Press reportersfrom the press pool after the outlet refused to follow an executive order renaming the Gulf of Mexico. AP’s lawyers argued that punishing a news organization for not using government-approved language is unconstitutional viewpoint discrimination – and the judge, a Trump appointee, agreed. Thecourt orderedthe White House to reinstate AP’s access to the press pool and related events. Instead, the administration eliminated the spot reserved for wire services entirely and openly defied the court’s order. Now, the government plans to take the case to the supreme court. Fortunately, AP’s legal team is standing firm.As AP’s chief White House reporter Zeke Miller testified, the government’s actions have already had achilling effecton the press. Since the AP was banned, the tone of questions directed at the president has noticeably softened. Reporters also say that sources — not just in politics, but in science and other fields — are now more hesitant to speak publicly. Some outlets are already facing leak investigations, and with Attorney General Pam Bondi rescinding the Biden-era policy that discouraged subpoenas against journalists last Friday, even more legal pressure is expected. That includes the very real prospect of criminal prosecution.The administration’s strategy of using funding as leverage is also having a serious effect on the media. It has pulled financial support from the US Agency for Global Media, which backs broadcasters such as Voice of America and Radio Free Asia – a move that undermines US efforts to promote democracy and fight disinformation abroad. After acongressional hearinglast month, the administration is proposing to eliminate nearly all funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which supports NPR, PBS and local public media outlets. Such a loss could severely affect the sustainability of these essential sources of news and information.All of this is happening at a time when longstanding legal protections for the press are under renewed attack. Opponents of media freedom are actively seeking to dismantleNew York Timesv Sullivan – the landmark supreme court decision that has safeguarded journalists for decades. That ruling established that public officials must prove “actual malice” to succeed in a libel suit, recognizing that the press needs breathing room to report freely, even if it sometimes gets things wrong. Under Sullivan, media outlets are only liable in cases brought by public figures if they knowingly publish false information or act with reckless disregard for the truth.Now, that precedent is being directly challenged. Sarah Palin, who this weeklost the retrialof her libel suit against the New York Times, has openly stated her intent to use the case as a vehicle to overturn Times v Sullivan. It’s unclear whether enough justices on the current court are prepared to go that far. Even if the decision stands, the legal landscape for journalists has become far less forgiving. With trust in the media at historic lows, judges are increasingly willing to let even the weakest defamation cases proceed – prolonging litigation, draining resources and placing a heavier burden on the press.It takes real courage to keep holding power to account in the face of growing legal threats. But it’s more important than ever that we do – and that we draw strength from the example of journalists around the world who have been reporting under pressure far greater, and for far longer, than we have.Kai Falkenberg is general counsel at the Guardian USExplore more on these topicsPress freedomOpinionDonald TrumpTrump administrationUS press and publishingNew York TimesLaw (US)US politicscommentShareReuse this content"

Just as anti-liberal powers outside the west are becoming stronger than ever, the assault on everything we stand for has been joined by the United States. Against this massed onslaught of anti-liberal nationalists we need a determined fightback of liberal internationalists.Canada’s election this weekcan contribute a strong mounted brigade.A core insight of liberalism is that, if people are to live together well in conditions of freedom, power always needs to be dispersed, cross-examined and controlled. Faced with the raw, bullying assertion of might, whether from Washington, Moscow or Beijing, we now have to create countervailing concentrations of power. In the long history of liberalism, a free press, the law, labour unions, a business community kept separate from political power, NGOs, truth-seeking institutions such as universities, civil resistance, multilateral organisations and international alliances have all served – alongside multiparty politics and regular free and fair elections – to constrain themen who would be kings.In rallying everyone who believes in equal individual liberty to this fight, we liberals have a problem of our own making. Policies associated in many people’s minds with liberalism over the last 40 years have themselves fed the reservoirs of popular discontent from whichnationalist populistscontinue to draw support. Neoliberalism, hypercharged through a globalised financialised capitalism, has led to levels of inequality not seen for a hundred years. An identity politics intended to remedy the historic disadvantages of selected minorities has left many other members of our societies – especially white, male, working and middle class – feeling themselves culturally as well as economically neglected. Both these approaches reneged on liberalism’s central promise, lucidly summarised by the philosopher Ronald Dworkin as “equal respect and concern” for all.Neoliberalism has also turned the world’s most powerful democracy into something very close to oligarchy. The separation of private wealth and public power – a precious and fragile innovation of modern liberal democracy – has been reversed. Insatiable plutocrats such as Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerbergare now supportersof Donald Trump’s political power, while he promotes his own and his rich pals’ economic interests. With the help of the media and platforms the plutocrats control, Trump persuades many ordinary Americans that their suffering is entirely due to foreigners (immigrants, China), while in reality it is more likely to be the fault of people such as Musk, Bezos and Zuckerberg.So we have to fight simultaneously on two fronts: with the enemies of liberalism and the problems created by liberalism itself. Unity will be strength. If we each try to negotiate separately with the bullies, be they in Washington, Moscow or Beijing, they will pick us off one by one.These coalitions of counter-power will be composed of states, but also of civil society actors and active citizens. At least half the population of the United States is with us. Electoral authoritarian states such as Turkey and Hungary also have lots of would-be-free citizens. The world’s largest example of applied liberal internationalism, the 27-country European Union, will be crucial to the fightback. So will major individual democracies including Britain, Canada, Japan and Australia.We need to do many things at once. Promoting free trade against Trumpian beggar-thy-neighbour protectionism is an obvious starting point. It’s also easier said than done, since mutually beneficial trading arrangements take time to craft. Yet there are some accessible immediate wins. A trade agreement between the EU and the Mercosur group of Latin American states only awaits ratification by all relevant parties. Britain and the EU should be more ambitious at their upcoming summit on 19 May. The EU doesn’t need anyone else’s involvement for it to create a single digital space and unified capital markets, nor to build up European defence industries, which would also be a neo-Keynesian economic stimulus.The monopolistic platforms and mega-wealth of the American oligarchs are a danger to all other countries. If the EU were prepared to use its regulatory superpower, coordinated with the efforts of other liberal democracies, we could do more to curb them. But regulation and taxation alone are not enough.Whether in Europe,Canada, Australia or Japan, our entire digital infrastructure is effectively American. Imagine one day your iPhone and iPad stopped working, along with your cloud provider, Google, Amazon, Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Twitter (AKA X-itter). What would be left? TikTok! “And Bluesky”, you may add, referencing the liberal social platform of choice. But that too is American. This is not only about infrastructure. It’s about how we create the digital public sphere essential for the future of liberal democracy.Civil society initiatives can also help. Why, for example, haven’t we already seen a major statement of solidarity withembattled US universitiesfrom universities across the liberal world?So can consumer protests. The impact of a largely spontaneous boycott of Tesla cars is pushing Musk to return to his business activity, cutting the leisure time he can spend on vandalising his country’s administrative state. Canadians now have the BuyBeaver app on their phones, sothey can avoid US-made goods. (I hope they boycott Russian ones too.)It’s also a matter of fighting style. Anti-liberal nationalists use the bludgeon, we the rapier. When they go low, we go high. When they go ape, we stay cool. When they lie through their teeth, we stand by the facts.In foreign policy, the most urgent challenge is to save Ukraine, which Trump isthrowing under the bus. The fact that he is pressing the Ukrainians to abandon even their legal claim to Crimea being part of Ukrainian sovereign territory shows how supporting Ukraine is now essential to defending fundamental principles of liberal international order.What emerges after this hurricane will not be the same as before. It will be transformed both by us learning from our own mistakes, so as to build back better, and by the revolutionary impact of Trump. A liberal democratic constellation that is not fundamentally secured by the US “liberal leviathan”, in the Princeton scholar John Ikenberry’s striking phrase, will be something very different from what we knew between 1945 and 2025.Even the geography will change. Canada, for example, which once seemed – in the nicest possible way – somewhat peripheral to world affairs, comfortably tucked up there between a friendly America and a frozen Arctic, now suddenly looks like a frontline state. One of the world’s most liberal countries is, beside Ukraine, one of the most directly threatened by Trump’s anti-liberal assault. And the thawing Arctic is a major new theatre of international competition. Fortunately,it looks as if Canadais going to have a government that is not just Liberal in name but also combatively liberal in nature.A quarter-century ago, when the United States was attacked by Islamist terrorists on 11 September 2001, the editor of Le Monde wrote a famous banner headline: “We are all Americans!” Today, friends of liberty the world over should say: “We are all Canadians!”Timothy Garton Ash is a historian, political writer and Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsUS foreign policyOpinionCanadaUS politicsEuropeTrump administrationcommentShareReuse this content"

Here are our lessons for the Trump ageJarosław KuiszandKarolina WiguraOur political history is one of catastrophe, communism, and developing powerful antibodies against oppressionMon 28 Apr 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 28 Apr 2025 12.58 EDTShareIn 2016, one year after the rightwing populist Law and Justice partywon an overall majority in Poland, there was a knock at a door. The mother of a young journalist opened it. To her astonishment, it was the security services looking for her son. No details were provided. Thus began an informal campaign by the authorities against the media and civil society in Poland, including our thinktank,Kultura Liberalna. After hearing the news about the journalist, we called Aleksander Smolar. The legendary anti-communist dissident, who ran his own NGO, told us that the security services were also trying to arrange “informal” meetings with his staff. And he comforted us: “Don’t worry, we’ve had a playbook for this kind of situation since the 1960s.”At that moment, we almost travelled back in time. We spoke about responding to this new regime as if we were once again under communism. What is striking in retrospect is that we all knew what to do. Our eastern European political culture, shaped by historical catastrophes, has developed some antibodies against oppressive power. Over the past centuries, the state has often been wiped off the map or occupied by foreign aggressors. Adversity sparks initiative.So, what advice did the former dissident give us? First, we started speaking publicly about what was happening. Second, we demanded that the security service officers present their actions in writing and with legal justification. As a result, the campaign disappeared as quickly as it appeared.Rightwing populists have many countries in their grip. Come to Poland: see how they can be pushed back | Anne McElvoyRead moreBut political harassment continued in other forms. The more emboldened the authorities became, the more elaborate (or crude) the stigmatisation of ideological opponents was. Soon, one thing became clear: as under communism, the political battlefield was everywhere. It touched every area of public life. Founding our thinktank in a democracy, we never imagined having to face political invigilation. That was naive.Our own struggle didn’t end with thePolish liberal opposition’s victory in 2023. What’s more, political attacks now take a transatlantic shape. As US Vice-President JD Vance made clear in hisMunich speechin February, in which he attacked European leaders, American rightwing populism has global ambitions.So here is a handful of suggestions for Americans and others who seem disoriented and overwhelmed.First: go beyond digital activism. A wave of anti-Trump street demonstrationsrecently swept across the US. In the age of social media, that might seem like an outdated or secondary tactic. But it’s not. In a time of effortless communication and online petitions, physical work matters twice as much. It sends a nonverbal message of urgency and sacrifice, and – more importantly – signals an invitation to fellow citizens to join. These protests should be regular and designed for the long haul. They should be citizen-led. Initially, flexible horizontal structures, ready for quick response, turned out to be more effective in practice in our experience.Second: no ageism, please. As our own history shows, opposing populism in power is possible only if intergenerational solidarity takes place. We heard a reporter sneer that the New York, anti-Trump protest crowd skewed old. So did ours in Poland! Yet over time, younger people joined in as the burdens of populism became more personal. Again – diversity matters most. Not just in communication tools, but in the social makeup of the protest movement.Third: it’s always the constitution, stupid. One hallmark of authoritarianism is the erosion of constitutional law. It’s not about abstract legal theories – it’s about changing the rules of the state without formal approval. Donald Trump’s musingsabout a potential third termare a prime example. The US constitution clearly forbids it. But the very mention signals a willingness to operate outside the legal order.Polish populists broke the constitutionalmost immediately after taking power. The consequences are still with us. What helped was keeping a detailed record of key legal violations.View image in fullscreenPeople at a freedom and solidarity day in Gdańsk, Poland, 2 June 2019.Photograph: Michał Fludra/NurPhoto/Getty ImagesJust as important was documenting the repression of civil society – like the example this article opened with. In an age of short attention spans, civil society must archive the illegality of populism – for rapid and effective accountability afterwards. The constitution is the terrain of the battlefield.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Ideally, they want to rid their political opponents from the country. But don’t let them force you into exile, if you can help it; resistance on the ground will be crucial, just as it was for figures in the anti-communist opposition in eastern Europe before 1989.Fifth: plan ahead. Perhaps the most psychologically difficult task is extending a hand to those with whom you have political disagreements. The facts are hard to ignore: in democracies, populists win through elections. Hardliners won’t change, but the 10-20% of swing voters in the centre can be decisive.Regaining power is possible but requires a dual-track approach. Use social media to shape political narratives. But also, unplug. Switch on to political aeroplane mode. Think long-term. Don’t get caught in the news cycle or buried under the “flood the zone” avalanche of absurdities populists use to wear down their critics.Plan for the next presidential election. It’s not enough to promise justice and institutional repair. You also need a compelling vision – a positive, practical alternative to the populist programme. Without it, the fuel runs out – even if you win an election. And have patience. Ultimately, the fight for democracy is never about just one election. Populism existed even inPericlean Athens. Which is why the struggle for liberal democracy requires a warm heart and a cool head. This is the core of the anti-authoritarian playbook.Jarosław Kuisz is editor-in-chief of the Polish weekly Kultura Liberalna and the author of The New Politics of Poland: A Case of Post-Traumatic SovereigntyKarolina Wigura isa Polish historian and co-author ofPost-Traumatic Sovereignty: An Essay (Why the Eastern European Mentality is Different)Explore more on these topicsPolandOpinionEuropeDonald TuskTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

Called Respect at Work, thereview into the culturethat incubated Jimmy Savile was published in 2013.Since then, theHuw Edwards scandal– along with allegations about other stars includingGregg Wallace(which he has said were “not all true”) –has led to another BBC reviewinto its own culture. Given it has exactly the same name and was written by the same consultancy, it seems fair to ask: what exactly has changed?Then, as now,BBCmanagement promised to “tackle issues more quickly and to greater effect”. Both reports also made a series of recommendations, all enthusiastically praised by senior management.The headline newsdenying that its culture was toxic, while suggesting several new codes of conduct, prompted one insider to quip that it was all very “Nothing to see here! Fixed!”The fact that the BBC led its flagship lunchtime bulletin with its own review rather than theblackout chaos in Europedid not help the sense of self-congratulation.Fixing workplace cultures, especially in an industry where competition for work is high and job security low, is not easy. A younger generation perhaps more willing to blow the whistle on bad behaviour is also working in an industry under even greater financial pressure.But, as culture minister Lisa Nandy said in welcoming the report, the public “expect[s] the very highest standards” from the BBC.In the latest review, there was a special mention for the “avoidance of consequences in the treatment of what used to be called ‘talent’ – ‘on-air’ or ‘on-screen’ presenters”, the promotion of a “call it out” culture and a new “respond team” to help restore trust.It is perhaps the last that is the most important, for the BBC has lost the trust of many of those who work there. For these people, scandal-hit stars are the tip of an iceberg that contains huge discrepancies in pay and conditions, and increasing job insecurity.Insiders suggest that faith in management acting on the new promises is low. “We’ve had reviews in the past,” said one long-serving member of staff. “Sensible recommendations have been made, but they’ve not been acted upon.”The BBC is largely full of good people trying to do the best they can in a job they love. The management team also want to bring about change. The fact that this so often results in lengthy repetitive reviews would not matter if there was the sense that real change, not just in terms of new HR policies but an actual difference in attitudes and behaviour, happened.BBC still has figures who can make life unbearable for colleagues, says chairRead moreThere are signs of hope. Samir Shah, a former journalist and widely respected BBC chair,issued a warning to the powerful individuals– on and off screen – who continue to abuse that power to make life for their colleagues “unbearable”.“If you are a person who is prepared to abuse power or punch down or behave badly, there is no place for you at the BBC,” he said. The director general, Tim Davie, said the report marked “an important moment for the BBC and the wider industry”.Change takes a while. But time is running out for victims.There was talk of a line in the sand being drawn on Monday. Let’s hope such good intentions don’t get washed away.Jane Martinson is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The second world war was followed by a longer war against the French, which was, in turn, followed by an even longer war against the Americans. Across 30 years of war, somewhere between 1 million and 2 million Vietnamese were killed in the fighting. We can’t be sure of the exact number – perhaps because of the industrial scale of the slaughter, or as Gen William Westmoreland, the commander of the American forces in Vietnam, once said,“Life is cheap in the Orient”– and so not worth the counting. Nor did war’s end bring an end to the dying: of the million or so refugees who fled on boats from the communist regime, 100,000 to 200,000 never made it to land.Fifty years since the sky fell: how the Vietnam war changed AustraliaRead moreFor the diaspora, these ghosts can return at any moment. But they are especially concentrated around one date: 30 April 1975 – the Fall of Saigon. Growing up, I had the images of this day seared into my memory by the photographs my parents kept and the stories they told: the families desperately trying to get on the last helicopter leaving the American embassy; the South Vietnamese soldiers stripping off their uniforms in the streets; the family friend – a high-ranking officer in the South Vietnamese army – killing himself rather than be captured. This year marks 50 years of those images – a half century of mourning the loss, not only of family and friends but the loss of a homeland.Like all diasporas, we are haunted by these losses. Each 30 April, we try to make these absences present through memory. And we do so in the face of twin threats. In Vietnam, the victorious government celebrates the date as the anniversary of liberation – there is no space for unofficial remembering. And in the countries where we sought refuge, we have always had to contend with the Westmorelands who say “the ‘oriental’ doesn’t put the same high price on life as does the westerner”. We find ourselves having to assert, over and over again, the value of our lives.But what does it do to our pain to have to remember it like this?There is a danger, common across diasporas, that in honouring our own dead, we do so to the exclusion of others’ ghosts. Jewish historian Jordana Silverstein writes of the way“narcissistic emotions”feed into “larger narcissistic political projects”: white fragility is central to reproducing white supremacy.We can see something like this dynamic playing out in the way the Vietnamese diaspora remembers 30 April. We mourn our own ghosts and leave it at that. For one thing, Vietnamese refugees and their families have failed, as a community, to properly reckon with our role as settlers here in Australia. I know from personal experience that it is too easy for non-white communities to disavow the ways we benefit from Indigenous dispossession by centring our own stories of dispossession and marginalisation. As if by remembering what my family fled – the tanks rolling into the presidential palace,the prison where my grandfather was held for 10 years– I can somehow exempt myself from the consequences of living on stolen lands.Silverstein writes that “some feelings have the weight of hegemony behind them”. That hegemonic weight comes more easily for some: think of the elevation of Andrew Bolt’s“devastated” feelingsin response to Indigenous academic Marcia Langton’s claiming he subjected a woman to foul “racial abuse” (whichdrew an apology fromher andthe ABC). For refugee and migrant communities, it takes a lot more effort to align their feelings with hegemonic power – an effort that is inevitably wasted. The sight ofSouth Vietnamese flags flying proudly outside the US Capitol during the insurrection on January 6was not enough to save Viets from anti-Asian hate during the pandemic. Nor does Vietnamese hostility to more recent refugee arrivals – often expressed as a recycling of the same racist tropes used against us when we arrived – ward off anti-Asian racism here in Australia.Vietnam: The War That Changed America review – a stunningly powerful tale of regretRead moreMore insidiously, the anti-communism of 30 April commemorations – even when not explicitly militaristic – tends to set the Vietnamese diaspora against other forms of communal and solidaristic politics. It is a way of remembering past suffering that keeps the community fixed in time – politically as well as emotionally. Yet it does not have to be that way. As Viet Thanh Nguyen, author of the Pulitzer prize-winning The Sympathiser, argues, a just ethics of memory“strives to remember one’s own and others”. This is a kind of mourning that draws us out of ourselves – refusing narcissistic exceptionalism – and draws connections between others’ pain and our own.Nguyen draws precisely this kind of connection in his recent writing on the genocide in Gaza, which he says is “not an incidental event that can be ignored but a fundamental event like the Vietnam war”. Nguyen’s focus is on American imperialism, and the complicity of Americans who say nothing against their government’s unstinting ideological and material support for Israel’s assault. But even for diasporic Vietnamese outside the US, this connection between Gaza and Vietnam places a special responsibility on how we mourn: as we remembermass graves in Huế, we must also remember – and condemn – mass graves atNasser hospital in Khan Younis and Al-Shifa hospital in Gaza city. And as we continue to insist that Vietnamese lives were never cheap, we must remember that today it is Palestinian lives –figured by Israeli politicians as “human animals”– that are deemed dispensable. Only through solidarity will we do justice for our ghosts.André Dao is the author of Anam, which won the 2024 Prime Minister’s Literary award for fiction.

As a Yuwaalaraay woman, I don’t need to be welcomed to my own country; my elders welcome visitors in an act of generosity and respect that is centuries old. This is all so familiar: another election campaign where punching down on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people for attention and votes is the default setting.Fibs and exaggeration have always been part of politics – but who knows what lies are now being pushed online?Read morePalmer also paid for big yellow ads in the media. The same message was plastered across the front page of Nine newspapers and their websites. News.com.au ran the ad the same day a small group including a “known neo-Nazi” were questioned by police forbooing the welcome to countryat the Melbourne Anzac Day dawn service.Sign up for the Afternoon Update: Election 2025 email newsletterGunditjmara-Bunurong elder Uncle Mark Brown stayed strong as he spoke over the noise. I hope he felt all his people there in solidarity with him, as he clearly felt the irony of talking about sacrifice, respect and unity in the face of such hate.Politicians were quick to condemn the booing. It was “deplorable”, an “utter disgrace”, a desecration of a “sacred day” for all Australians, including the generations of Indigenous servicemen and women who fought and died for their country.Speaking afterwards, Peter Dutton said welcomes to country were “an important part of official ceremonies and should be respected”. Anthony Albanese said it was up to individual organisations to decide whether to open their events with one.In short: a welcome to country is a modern adaptation of a First Nations practice where visitors would seek and be granted safety and welcome from traditional owners to travel through their country, in exchange respecting traditional protocols and practices. Anacknowledgmentof country can be offered by anyone and is usually given at the beginning of a meeting, speech or event.5:05Hecklers boo Indigenous elder during Melbourne Anzac Day dawn service welcome to country – videoIn recent years, and especially since the defeat of the voice referendum, there have been sustained attacks on welcomes to country in the media, politics, and in sport. Sam Newman suggested puntersshould boo the welcome to countryahead of the 2023 AFL grand final. So, it is disingenuous for politicians on all sides to be shocked and outraged when people decide to turn those words into action, even in the predawn hush of Anzac Day.Muslim Australians are crying out to be heard. Will the major parties listen to us? | Shadi Khan SaifRead moreBy that evening, Wurundjeri elder Aunty Joy Murphy Wandin said she was told by the Melbourne Storm that she wasno longer needed to give the welcome to countryfor their Anzac Day match against the Rabbitohs.“We were all just dumbfounded,” Aunty Joy told Nine. “We would dearly love to be out there, but they’ve broken our hearts.”The Storm released a statement blaming the cancellation on a “miscommunication”.By Sunday night, in the final leaders’ debate before polling day, Duttonhad returned to his view– that welcomes to country were dividing the nation, and there is “a sense across the community that it is overdone”.Today Dutton leaned even further into his welcome to country bashing byclaiming that most veterans“don’t want [a welcome to country]” on that day.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toAfternoon Update: Election 2025Free daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key election campaign stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But Dutton’s comments show an ignorance of thesignificant Indigenous contributionto Australia’s defence forces.Thousands of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander men and women have served in the ADF, andfought in every major conflictfrom the Boer war to Afghanistan. At least 70 Aboriginal men were stationed on the front lines and in the trenches at Gallipoli. More than 1,000 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders served in the first world war, though it’s hard to pin down exact numbers because those who signed up to fight for country did so despite the Defence Act preventing people “not substantially of European origin or descent” from enlisting.Long before this weekend, there has been an absence of Indigenous policy in this election campaign, an extension of the leadership vacuum we have felt since October 2023.In April, former social justice commissioner Mick Gooda said there is alack of courage on Indigenous affairs.“We need people to stick a stake in the ground about where we’re going,” Gooda said.“Once we know where they stand … we can move forward. But at the moment, we just don’t know.”Meanwhile, the Age reports, rightwing extremists are considering moves toestablish their own political party.It will be a relief to some when the Trumpet of Patriots’ big yellow billboards are dismantled. I know a few people who’d be happy to help. But the festering resentment over welcomes to country, or indeed any of the rights we as First Nations people have fought for and gained, any of the protocols or acts of respect we have sought to maintain, will remain until we see some strong leadership and action on racism in politics and the media.Anthony Albanese said the “known neo-Nazi” who booed, the ones who have stalked his and other candidates’ campaigns, are a real threat. We need to take them seriously. But we can’t do that without also addressing the licence they are given by the tone of mainstream political debate.Lorena Allam is descended from the Gamilaraay and Yuwaalaraay nations of north-western NSW.

In fact, they produce ever more hassle and chaosAndy BeckettCentrists won’t beat Reform UK by echoing its messages. They should emphasise the true unworkability of policies like BrexitMon 28 Apr 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 28 Apr 2025 13.35 EDTShareIn the middle of an election or the early stages of an administration, populist politics can feel like a liberation. The unsayable is said. Political rules are broken. Constitutional restrictions are flouted. Populist rallies are boisterous, seemingly uninhibited, with enemies of the movement taunted or intimidated.For many voters, and even some activists and politicians, conventional politics can be boring, with its careful rhetoric and predictably choreographed campaigns, its compromised and complicated centrist policies. Populism promises something much more visceral, with larger-than-life leaders and dramatic national goals: “make America great again”, “take back control”. Digital media, with its constant hunger for brevity and straightforward narratives, is a perfect environment for populism’s seductive claim that politics is actually quite simple.This week’sEnglish local electionsand Runcorn and Helsby byelection may become the latest demonstrations that the era of simplistic politics has plenty of years left to run. Having based its campaign on the dubious claim that almost all Britain’s problems come from too much immigration, Reform UK is expected to take hundreds of council seats from the Tories, has a chance of winning Runcorn and Helsby from Labour, and may also win one or more regional mayoralties. If any of these things happen, Nigel Farage’s insistent bragging that only his party can “fix broken Britain”, and the belief that Reform could even win the next general election, will gain further momentum.And yet, there are also more and more signs that the politics of simplicity, when applied by populist or populist-influenced governments to real-world problems, actually turns into its opposite. Brexit has become a byword for more border hassle and import-export paperwork. Meanwhile, the desire to control immigration much more tightly is creating new bureaucracies, law enforcement bodies, migrant quotas, and detention and processing facilities around the globe. Trying to police nationality in a world that capitalism – and generations of previous rightwing politicians – spent decades making more fluid and interconnected is proving much more complicated than many populists and their supporters expected.Even the most powerful populist government, the Trump administration, after barely three months in office, is already becoming an increasingly bad-tempered attempt to micromanage a vast and widening range of US institutions.Its letter from 11 Aprildemanding “reforms” at Harvard University, for example, is five densely written pages long. Among many other things, the letter tells the university to commission an external body, approved by the federal government, “to audit the student body, faculty, staff, and leadership for viewpoint diversity” – the government’s code for the inclusion of conservatives – “such that each department, field or teaching unit must be individually viewpoint diverse”. These audits should happen “every year”, the letter continues, “at least until the end of 2028” – which just happens to be near the end of Trump’s second term.The scale and thoroughness of this state intervention in a private university, which Harvard is trying to fight off, is profoundly disturbing for anyone who believes in academic freedom. Yet the letter also suggests that the Trump administration could become immensely and impractically bureaucratic. It’s aiming to reshape and then monitor an undefined number of previously independent institutions, to impose “diversity” when it benefits conservatives, but eradicate it when it benefits anyone else.For some populist voters, seeing elites being challenged and discomfited is satisfying in itself, whether it leads to concrete change or not. But other people voted for Trump because they wanted less government, and for them a more interventionist, quite possibly overambitious and more expensive state may be a disillusioning outcome. And without the support of both groups, the Republicans will find it hard to maintain their supremacy for long.In the last century, far-right movements sometimes managed to combine the unshackled feelings of populist politics, stirred up by a charismatic leader, with strict social control. “Fascist aesthetics,” wrote Susan Sontag in a 1975 essay on Nazi rallies, involve “two seemingly opposite states, egomania and servitude”. While today’s transatlantic populism is not as authoritarian, it also seeks to tame what it sees as the disorder and unhealthy pluralism of liberal society. Farage’s public persona may be mischievous and jolly, but the Reform website sternly promises “zero-tolerance policing” of “all crime and antisocial behaviour” and “no gender questioning, social transitioning or pronoun swapping” in schools. As with the Trump administration, it appears Reform’s instinctive response to the modern world is to try to ban things.Could the uptightness behind rightwing populism’s irreverent facade be used against the movement? In theory, centrist politicians who have spent their careers compromising with different interest groups, in order to maintain their position in the political middle ground, ought to be able to attack conservative populism as too rigid and backward-looking. The pro-immigration Spanish socialist prime minister,Pedro Sánchez, has done this, and has stayed in power since 2018, an unusually long time for a modern centre-left leader. Support for the Spanish rightwing populist party Vox peaked three years ago, and is now barely half the level of Reform’s.Yet in other countries, including Britain, too many centrists are still trying to beat populism by echoing its policies and messages. Announcing last week that it would be the first British governmentto publish the nationalitiesof foreigners who commit crimes here, with league tables of the offending countries likely to follow, is probably not the best way for Keir Starmer’s administration to present itself as the positive alternative to the pessimistic xenophobia of Reform.Rightwing populists are correct that many people find the modern world chaotic and frightening. But conservative populism focuses on the struggles of straight, white, working-class men, and largely ignores capitalist modernity’s many other victims. This narrow outlook makes the movement’s social vision, however electorally appealing, a nostalgic dead end, in essence a deluded and coercive plan to return to the 1950s.Anti-populist politicians need to remind voters that that hierarchical world is gone, while acknowledging that the freer world that replaced it has, for many people, not been nearly free enough. Until centrism or socialism or conservatism can offer a good life to more, then the fake exuberance of populism will draw the crowds.Andy Beckett is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsLocal elections 2025OpinionLocal electionsLocal governmentReform UKLabourNigel FarageLocal politicscommentShareReuse this content"

I spent weeks pondering its significance and discovered much later that this striking image was the work of Australian artistPeter Drew, who sought to challenge the exclusivity of national identity and acknowledge the often overlooked histories shaped by the White Australia policy.The man on the poster, Monga Khan, was one of many Afghan cameleers who, in the 19th century, played a crucial role in connecting Australia to the wider world by helping to build the telegraph lines across the vast outback. As a journalist who fled Afghanistan during the fall of Kabul and was now settling into life in Melbourne, I was also reflecting on my own relationship to this curious label.Sign up for the Afternoon Update: Election 2025 email newsletterLiving in the multicultural area of Casey in the city’s south-east, I have noticed the complexities of identity struggles within various communities, and how these tensions echoed through the political arena. During the 2022 Victorian state elections I volunteered with the electoral commission, giving me an intimate perspective on how different party manifestos shaped the national fabric, often revealing gaps in political representation for minority communities.Having spent much of my career fighting for democracy and equal rights in Afghanistan’s autocratic and feudal system, I find it fascinating to witness how those same principles of identity and representation unfold here in Australia.Nearly two centuries after Monga Khan roamed this land, Muslim Australians like myself continue to navigate the political implications of our identity. The challenge is not merely one of representation but of belonging – ensuring that in the pursuit of political solutions no community is left feeling alienated from the very nation it calls home.This tension has heightened since the Gaza war and was alsolaid bare in Februarywhen Creative Australia decided to revoke Lebanese Australian artist Khaled Sabsabi’s appointment as Australia’s representative in the Venice Biennale just five days after he was selected, following negative commentary around two of his historical works.Sabsabi hasdescribed his angerat the decision and how damaging the past two months have been: “I’m a Lebanese Muslim Australian artist. Regardless of my ethnicity or where I was born, regardless of my faith, I am an Australian artist, who has lived here for the majority of my life. So therefore I should be entitled to the rights of every other Australian citizen.”He has also described what he called a “double – or triple – standard” when it comes to the idea of citizenship in Australia. “Who is Australian? What is Australian? These definitions, and these hierarchies of citizenship, all they do is just further divide the nation, further cause infighting and breed more hate, breeds more distrust of the other.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toAfternoon Update: Election 2025Free daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key election campaign stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It has no doubt been exacerbated by the war in Gaza, and the rise in reports of Islamophobia in the community (the number of in-person incidentsdoubled between late 2024 and early 2023, with women and children disproportionately targeted).It’s unsurprising in this context to see groups such as Muslim Votes Matter and The Muslim Vote emerge ahead of this election. These organisations are hoping to gain support from Muslim Australians who feel left out of the major parties and disenchanted by the status quo.While any push to amplify the voices of a marginalised community should be welcomed, these groups face the challenge of representing large and diverse communities which have different political beliefs within them. Regardless of their success at the ballot box, I hope they serve as a wake-up call for the major parties in seeking more inclusivity within their own ranks.While I am not yet entitled to vote in Australian elections, I will be watching with interest as migrants such as myself wrestle with the idea of identity and citizenship, and what exactly it means to be “Aussie”.

The idea of touching one, picking one up, I find very off-putting.”In October 2021 he was in Santa Fe, New Mexico, on the set of his sixth feature, the western Rust, when a gun being held by the film’s star,Alec Baldwin, was discharged accidentally during rehearsals. The weapon should have been loaded with blanks but a live round had found its way into the chamber. The movie’s Ukrainian cinematographer Halyna Hutchins was fatally wounded. Souza was hit in the shoulder by the same bullet that killed her.I didn’t watch the Baldwins’ reality show. I was too busy hitting myself in the face with a frying pan that nightDid he think he might die? “I don’t remember what was going through my head. One of the stranger aspects is that it felt like I was lying there for five minutes. Apparently, it was half an hour.” Hutchins was taken away by helicopter, Souza in an ambulance. “I knew I could breathe but I didn’t know what to expect until I got to the hospital.”In the aftermath, there was blame-slinging, multiple criminal cases and an official report that described the film’s producers as indifferent to gun safety. A settlement was paid by Baldwin to Hutchins’ family. Her widower Matthew Hutchins confirmed that all parties “believe Halyna’s death was a terrible accident”.View image in fullscreen‘I was a mess’ … director Joel Souza.Photograph: Czarek Sokołowski/APAt the trial last summer, a charge of involuntary manslaughter against Baldwin was dismissed when it emerged that the prosecution had mishandled evidence. But the charge stuck in the case of the film’s prop armourer Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, who is serving an 18-month prison sentence. Dave Halls, assistant director on Rust, accepted a plea bargain and was convicted of negligent use of a firearm.Even before Baldwin walked free, something unexpected had happened: 18 months after Hutchins’ death, the film resumed shooting. “The family wanted it completed,” explains Souza. “I’d been repelled by the thought of going back, but now it started to appeal. And I couldn’t live with the idea of someone else doing it.”During the first round of filming in 2021, there were disagreements with Baldwin over the nature of his character. One of Souza’s stipulations for returning was that everyone on set had to fall in line with his vision. “It’s not that I’m standing there with my foot on anybody’s neck,” he says. “But there were fights I needed not to have. That was the only way I could get through this.”And so he found himself back on the set of Rust, directing the actor who had shot him in the shoulder. “I was a mess going in and a mess coming out. The crew carried me through. My family carried me through. Emotionally, I was all over the map.”And physically? “Sometimes it’s fine. Sometimes it catches on fire. The physical therapist at the time said, ‘We’re going to get you back to 70% range of motion.’ I looked shocked. They were like, ‘You’re almost 50. Don’t kid yourself you had 100% to start with.’” For the first and only time in our long conversation, he allows himself a smile.Two and a half years on from the accident, Rust is about to be released. It’s a solid piece of work, gorgeously photographed by Hutchins and Bianca Cline, the latter shooting the 50% or so of scenes that hadn’t been completed, as well as the ones that needed to be reshot as some of the original actors were no longer available.Souza had insisted from the start on a female cinematographer, which is how he met Hutchins. “The agencies throw male candidates at you, but I know there are a lot of women coming out of the American Film Institute. Then somebody told me, ‘Women can’t shoot westerns.’ And I thought, ‘Fuck you. I’m going to stick that up your ass andonlylook at women.’”After the accident, word got around that Rust had been some tawdry enterprise all along. “I heard people say, ‘Oh, it’s this straight-to-video geezer-teaser piece-of-crap.’ And it wasn’t. Did people think someone as talented as Halyna would waste her time on that?” With its themes of guilt and atonement, Rust is more like a kid brother to Clint Eastwood’s Unforgiven. Baldwin gives a troubled performance as grizzled outlaw Harland Rust – and actually it is possible to watch the movie without seeing tragedy in every frame.View image in fullscreenTop billing … Halyna Hutchins on the set of Rust.Photograph: Felipe OrozcoNot that there aren’t moments to make one wince. Souza knew from the outset that he would not include the scene that Baldwin was rehearsing when the fatal shot was fired, but there is only so much that could be expunged without destroying the film’s essence. Although it is no surprise that a western should contain guns and shootouts, some of the echoes in Rust are uncanny. The entire plot hinges, for instance, on an accidental shooting: this is how the orphaned teenager Lucas, played by Patrick Scott McDermott, ends up in prison. Later, when Rust busts him out, there is much brooding over a rifle that has been handed down through the generations. “It’s ruined the life of almost anyone it’s ever come across,” the kid says.Souza sighs at this. “The movie is about what it’s about: the consequences of violence. There’s a real anti-gun aspect to it.”There’s still this feeling in the film industry that it could never happen to themHe may have been able to save Rust but he had no control over what Baldwin did next. The actor attracted derision earlier this year for his ill-timed reality TV show, which showed him and his family soldiering on in extreme luxury.This paper calledThe Baldwins “unnecessary” and “distasteful”. Souza didn’t watch it. “I think I was busy hitting myself in the face with a frying pan that night,” he says.Last summer, he said of Baldwin: “We’re not friends. We’re not enemies. There’s no relationship.” Today, he uses some of the same language when I ask about Gutierrez-Reed, the jailed prop armourer. “There is no relationship,” he shrugs. “I think we might have had a couple of conversations first time around. She seemed nice enough. I just feel terrible for everybody. There can be no joy taken in someone going to jail.”Inevitably, he still goes over that October day in his head. “You think about the chain of events that started that morning. Bad decision after bad decision was made.” As the film’s writer-director, is there anything he wishes he could do over? “Talk about the butterfly effect,” he says. “I wish I never wrote the damn movie.”View image in fullscreenInvestigators seal off the prop cart after the on-set accident.Photograph: Santa Fe County Sheriff’s Office/AFP/Getty ImagesBut he did. And now it’s finally out there, with the addition of some significant nods to Hutchins. She is second-billed after him in the end credits: unheard of for a cinematographer, and likely a contravention of guild rules. “Let some son of a bitch come say a word about that,” Souza says, “and I’ll fight him in the street!” So far, no one has.The film is also dedicated to Hutchins, and features her name in the credits in Ukrainian as well as in English. “I wanted to include that for her mother,” says Souza. The dedication is accompanied by a line that became a mantra for Hutchins after setting up every shot: “How can we make it better?”Souza says: “She was asking, ‘How can we improve this shot?’ But I found it to be even more profound than that. If you apply ‘How can we make it better?’ to every aspect of life, one small act at a time, then maybe this place can finally live up to its potential and its purpose.” In the context of Rust, the question takes on a promise of healing: an attempt to draw something positive from the horror of what happened.Unfortunately, there are signs that the accident has done little to change the industry. “You’ll talk to people who have been on other sets and they say it’s on their minds,” says Souza. “But there’s also this feeling that it could never happen to them. They say, ‘Sometimes a hurricane lands where it lands.’”Last year he met a veteran cinematographer who told him about a film set in Los Angeles where live ammo was recently discovered. “It had made its way from the truck and through the initial check and they only caught it at the absolute last second. He said this was a major studio shoot. He told me, ‘People aren’t changing. They all feel like you guys were just unlucky.’”Rust is released in the US on 2 May. A UK release is yet to be confirmed.Explore more on these topicsFilmRust film set shootingAlec BaldwinWesternsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

As such, they’ve both logged their time in superhero movies of recent vintage (though Robbie’s turn as Harley Quinn is probably better-known than whatever Sweeney found herself doing in Madame Web). It feels notable, then, that in recent weeks they’ve both been connected to multiple projects based on video games. Robbie’s Lucky Chap plans to produce a movie based onThe Sims; Sweeney, meanwhile, will produceOutRun, based on a 30-year-old arcade game, and has also signed to star in a movie based on the more recent hit gameSplit Fiction. Score a bunch of points for the gamers. Is the dawn of gamer cinema finally here?Minecraft mania: how millions of rowdy kids saved the box officeRead moreRegardless of this Hot Lady defection, superhero movies and other comics-based properties will probably stick around for years to come. Marvel still kicks off the summer movie season this week with Thunderbolts, and the MCU series in particular has probably reached (and touched) too many people to go the way of Transformers movies quite yet. Still: games are providing major competition as far as Hollywood’s favorite IP. While Marvel and DC movies have flopped left and right in the past two years, that same period has seen the release of the top three videogame-based movies of all time. That list includes A Minecraft Movie, which is stillraking in moneyeven after the Chicken Jockey riots have quieted.As with superhero cinema before its 2000s-era boom, video games provided the source material for plenty of movies over the course of several hit-or-miss decades, with an emphasis on miss: the first try at adapting Super Mario Bros into film was crushed by the summer of Jurassic Park (and its own frenetic weirdness); an attempted Tomb Raider franchise only lasted two movies (one big hit and one expensive flop); and plenty of shoot-em-up games like Doom were shot down. Adding insult to injury, many of the most popular game-related or game-imitative movies, like Wreck-It Ralph or Free Guy, weren’t based on actual games at all. Meanwhile, actual game-based hits often seemed to use those titles as a brand-name foot in the door, not depending much on their storytelling or lore; Paul WS Anderson, for example, imposed his emerging style and fixations on the six-movie Resident Evil cycle like a much lower-rent version of Tim Burton reshaping Batman to fit his own sensibilities.View image in fullscreenA still from The Super Mario Bros Movie.Photograph: Nintendo/© 2022 Nintendo and Universal StudiosThat’s not the case with the new crop of game movies. AMinecraftMovie has plenty of bits that obviously share a film-maker with Napoleon Dynamite, to be sure, but for the most part, these recent hits based on Minecraft, Super Mario Bros, Sonic the Hedgehog, and Five Nights at Freddy’s have been aimed at a crowd of super-young and dedicated fans (and, with the older games like Mario and Sonic, their nostalgic parents), sometimes to the point of not much resembling real movies to older audiences. Just as superhero movies belatedly reflected comic books’ transition to an audience that was older than their kid-stuff reputation, these new movies offer proof of just how culturally dominant video games actually are, especially for millennials, zoomers and emerging gen alpha kids. And compared with comics, which in their traditional newsstand-style form peaked well over half a century ago and have experienced major ups and downs since, the game industry hasn’t spent as much time teetering on the edge of oblivion. If it has taken a while for games to step into the Hollywood spotlight, well, decades also passed between big hit movies starring Superman, Batman and Spider-Man.This doesn’t mean that game movies are now automatic blockbusters; just ask the recent releaseUntil Dawn, adapted from a horror survival game (although, to be fair, the bar for a smaller-budget horror movie based on a less kid-friendly game is much lower). None of those aforementioned Robbie or Sweeney projects have the legacy or automatic kid appeal of Minecraft, Mario or Sonic. Minecraft and Mario in particular are part of the cultural fabric in ways that Hollywood seemed to, perhaps, collectively disbelieve. At best, they may not be great at telling the difference between a lasting cultural legacy and a fad.That’s because as much as executives can be chastised for mindless trend-chasing, they’re often enormously cautious about anything that’s genuinely new. Even the seemingly unlikely B-team that Marvel used to support its first push toward the Avengers initiative – Iron Man and Thor were hardly Spider-Man, Wolverine or the Fantastic Four – had decades of publishing history behind it. For an older executive, Minecraft might have looked like a flash in the pan; despite its relatively robust history, Chris Hemsworth has been playing Thor longer than the game has existed. As with the post-Batman slate of movies inspired by pulp superheroes of the ’30s and ’40s, rather than comics of the ’70s and ’80s, there will doubtless be movies based on games that no one under the age of 30 has actually spent much time playing. Hence Sweeney and Michael Bay getting a deal to make a movie out of OutRun, a car-racing game from 1986 that doesn’t exactly feature Mario-and-Luigi-level icons. (It would be lucky to boast a Wario.)View image in fullscreenTika Sumpter, James Marsden and Sonic in Sonic the Hedgehog.Photograph: Photo Credit: Courtesy Paramount Pictures and Sega of America/PR Handout undefinedArtistically, though, these smaller games could still prove to hold a major advantage; no one has made a great movie out of a game as beloved as Mario or Sonic, and despite their success and fan love, many recent attempts still barely clear “good”. In other words, there is still room to experiment before the process hardens into formula. While superhero comics have narrowed in their on-screen interpretations, adapting games might be a sidelong way of embracing a more diverse slate of genres. The upcomingLegend of Zelda moviecould bring back Lord of the Rings-style fantasy, while whatever the movie of The Sims is, it probably won’t be an action-adventure extravaganza. Then again, there’s always the danger that attempting to honor sometimes-janky source material will simply result in movies that feel as if they have been backwards-engineered by people who don’t actually know anything about movies.Five Nights at Freddy’s, for example, plays less like the unlocking of a cultural phenomenon, or even a competent genre movie, and more like a horror movie translated into another language, then re-translated back with such haste that everything about it feels off.Regardless, there is more where that came from;the sequel to Five Nights at Freddy’sis on its way, as are more Sonic, Mario and Minecraft movies. Surely someone (probably Nintendo) will try to forge a Marvel-style cinematic universe. The truly lingering question about the state of game-based movies is whether they bring a younger generation back to the big screen in greater numbers, or turn the moviegoing experience into a large-scale simulation – a bonus level to occasionally play through before returning home to their consoles.Explore more on these topicsFilmGamesMinecraftfeaturesShareReuse this content"

So I borrowed a pen and paper, sat down and started writing’Interviews byHenry YatesMon 28 Apr 2025 09.38 EDTLast modified on Mon 28 Apr 2025 12.57 EDTShareMark Knopfler, guitar/vocals/writerI was in an appliance shop in New York and there was a big bonehead in there delivering gear. All the TVs were tuned to MTV and I overheard this guy sounding off about the rock stars on the screens. He had an audience of one – the junior at the store – and some of his lines were just too good to be true.Things like: “That little motherfucker’s got his own jet airplane!” And: “He’s banging on the bongos like a chimpanzee!” And: “That ain’t working!” That was just the way he spoke – and in that New York accent too. The bells were going off in my head but I didn’t have a pen with me, so I borrowed one, got a bit of paper and I actually sat down in the window display area of the store and started writing out the lines to Money for Nothing as he said them.We recorded on Montserrat and I said: 'Wouldn’t it be great if Sting could sing?' And someone said: 'He’s on the beach!'The guitar lick is just a stomp, a two-fingered boogie. It comes from the clawhammer style and it’s got its own rhythm. It was just fun to do. But there were a whole bunch of fortunate incidents that collided with each other to create the song. For instance, I’d seen the Police on the MTV channel saying the phrase: “I want my MTV.” But they also had a song called Don’t Stand So Close to Me, so I put “I want my MTV” to that melody and included it at the start.While we were recording the Brothers in Arms album at Air Studios on Montserrat, I remember thinking: “Wouldn’t it be great if I could ask Sting to sing that line?” We were on this tiny speck in the middle of the ocean but suddenly someone said: “Sting’s here on holiday! He’s on the beach!” So he came up to the studio and when he walked in, the first thing he said was: “What’s wrong?” I said: “What do you mean?” And he said: “Nobody’s fighting …” [unlike in the Police].View image in fullscreenThe Money for Nothing sleeve artwork.Photograph: AlamyBrothers in Arms was huge. So many people wanted to see the band live. After we played Live Aid at Wembley Stadium, we ran across the car park to Wembley Arena where we were playing that night. In fact, one of the reasons why it felt like I had to scale things back was going into catering and not recognising the crew. That’s when I realised the size of it.John Illsley, bassWe’d already had four successful albums, so the expectations for Brothers in Arms were pretty high. Thankfully Mark’s writing was sharp as a tack. At that point, we’d convene in a mews house in west London, just with guitars, an acoustic bass and a keyboard, and run through material Mark had been working on.The Money for Nothing chords and lyrics were already there – and obviously there was Mark’s riff, which was pretty extraordinary. It’s funny: when other guitarists try that riff, they play all the right notes but don’t get the feel. We took our time, and it went from being aMark Knopflersong to a Dire Straits song. I played the bass in a simple way, happily sitting on the chords, putting down that engine room.Its title is ironic, because we’d been working solidly for years to get to that point. But everybody viewed us from the outside. Like: “Oh, look at them, that ain’t working, that’s just money for nothing – and they get the chicks thrown in for free.” But it was a bit like Picasso, when he’d do a quick drawing for someone and people would say: “That only took you 10 seconds.” And he’d say: “No, it took me 40 years.”View image in fullscreen‘We called it a day’ … the band with John Illsley, left.Photograph: Ilpo Musto/ShutterstockBrothers in Arms was the first record we’d made with Guy Fletcher, who was a very technical musician. He knew how to work these modern keyboards, while Alan Clark was a wonderful piano player. The two of them created that Money for Nothing intro, and Terry Williams played the most explosive drum solo I’ve ever heard. Then the riff comes in. The guitar tone you hear on the record happened by accident: a microphone got knocked to the floor in front of the speaker and it changed the sound completely.Money for Nothing wasNo 1 in Americawhile Brothers in Arms wasNo 1 on the US album chartat the same time. We really enjoyed that success, but the fame … not so much. After the tour, there was a definite feeling we had to put this to bed. We reconvened for On Every Street in 1991 and that tour was physically and mentally exhausting. Mark had definitely had enough. For everybody’s sanity – but mostly his – we called it a day. But I honestly still enjoy playing Money for Nothing as much now as I did then. A good song is like a good picture – it never fades.Dire Straits’ Brothers in Arms (40th Anniversary Edition) is released on 16 May on LP, CD and Blu-Ray.

She talks about her #MeToo moment, her difficult childhood and her new movie, Chosen FamilyByEmine SanerMon 28 Apr 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 28 Apr 2025 06.10 EDTShareFor almost all her life, Heather Graham says, she was a “people pleaser”. It was encouraged in childhood, she says, this obligation to put others’ needs above her own, and it endured even after the 1997 film Boogie Nights had made her a star and she had severed all contact with her “judgmental, authoritarian” parents.Now 55, Graham was in her 40s before she recognised her self-sabotaging tendencies, and tried to correct course. “I realised, no, actually I can just ask myself, ‘What do I want?’ and make myself happy,” she says over Zoom from her home in Los Angeles. “I wish I could have had this when I was 20 or 15. If I wasn’t trying to please other people, what would I have done?” It affected her romantic life and sometimes her work. “There were moments where I feel like I could have stood up for myself more,” she says.That revelation helped inspire her new movie, Chosen Family, which she wrote and directed. It is, she says, essentially about what happens when a people pleaser says no. “I wanted to take some things in my life that I had found hard and painful and turn it into comedy.”View image in fullscreenGraham with James Le Gros, Kelly Lynch and Matt Dillon in the 1989 film Drugstore Cowboy.Photograph: TCD/Prod.DB/AlamyGraham plays Ann, a child-free yoga teacher struggling with her manipulative, dysfunctional family, who embarks on a relationship with a divorced father. There are obvious parallels with her creator – Graham is a yoga fan, has a dysfunctional family (at least in her view), and has been in relationships with men who have children. Was it cathartic to write? “It was, because I think having a sense of humour about yourself and your life, it helps to not take things too seriously.”In the film, Ann’s family, especially her religious father, are disapproving of her relationships and expect her to look after her younger sister Clio (played by Julia Stiles), who has a drug addiction. Graham hasn’t spoken to her own family for about 30 years. “I think I felt, as a younger person, that I couldn’t really set boundaries with them that they would respect, so I wanted to explore that in the movie.”Chosen Family review – fluid directing by Heather Graham ballasts enjoyable romcomRead moreOther emotions also get an airing. Ann seems sad that she never had children, though Graham has always seemed like a great advert for the happily child-free woman. “I think I’ve had moments where I wondered: what would it have been like if I had a kid? I guess I would say 80% of the time I feel glad I don’t have kids, and I feel free and really good about it, and maybe 20% of the time I wonder what would it be like. You just have to appreciate the life you have.”She admires women who buck society’s expectations. “I do think it’s awesome now that more women are expressing their desire to not have kids.” Again, she says, it is almost people pleasing on a big scale. “The culture says: ‘You need to have kids.’ But why? If you’re not being a people pleaser, what do you really want?”It took Graham a long time to work out what she wanted. Her father worked for the FBI and her mother was a teacher who became a poet and writer of children’s books; Graham’s younger sister is also now an actor and director. The family lived in Agoura Hills, in the Santa Monica mountains north of Los Angeles, and Graham says she was shy and nerdy, but could come out of herself when dressing up and in school plays. As a teenager, she would go to auditions in LA for popular teenage girl roles, “like a beautiful cheerleader – and I was not a cheerleader. I felt like I was acting out my fantasy: I wish I was the girl at school that the boys liked.” She got work quickly – at 17, she was in her first big film role, the 1988 teen comedy License to Drive.At about the same time, she was offered a role in the black comedy Heathers. “My parents vetoed it.” Graham moved out, and it was the beginning of the end of her relationship with them. “I kind of became my own person and discovered: ‘What do I like? What do I want when I’m not under this very judgmental, authoritarian, parental, patriarchal structure? What do I want to do? What do I think of this?’”View image in fullscreenIn Chosen Family.Photograph: Everett/ShutterstockIn her mid-20s, Graham decided to cut contact with her parents and sister. By then, her career had taken off, with roles in Drugstore Cowboy and Six Degrees of Separation, and as a recurring character in Twin Peaks. “My father’s really religious, and they were, especially my father, very critical of everything I was doing.” To her parents, she says, Hollywood seemed like a pit of sin, and they didn’t approve of the roles – usually the sexy love interest – that Graham was getting. “It didn’t feel like a healthy dynamic. I stopped talking to them and, I have to say, that was a huge relief. I felt like, at that moment, my life opened up with a freedom. I didn’t need to please them.”As a child, she says: “I feel like I wasn’t brought up to have a deep sense of self-esteem, and I think as I detached from my family, I built my own sense of self-esteem. Sort of like a detective, I went through my past and looked at how I developed certain ways of thinking that weren’t the healthiest, and basically just went on a journey to be happier.”Over the years, did they try to contact her? “There was an effort made, but it was always very judgmental like: ‘Let me give you the number of the priest and you can go to confession.’ I just think we’re really different. They have a lot of great qualities – it’s just not a healthy dynamic for me.”By the early 2000s, when Graham was in her early 30s, she had built a successful career, including an acclaimed role as Rollergirl, a pornographic actor in Boogie Nights, as the girlfriend of the main character in Swingers and as sexy CIA agent Felicity Shagwell in the Austin Powers sequel. Did she feel objectified? “On one hand, it was fun, because I grew up feeling nerdy and like I wasn’t the attractive girl at school. I felt flattered; I felt like I was playing a character, like I was pretending to be this attractive actress. Underneath it all, I really felt like this nerdy girl.”View image in fullscreenWith Mike Myers in 1999’s Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me.Photograph: FlixPix/AlamyBut she also found it frustrating to be continually cast as the love interest. “I related to the awkward romantic comedy heroines more than to the glam characters. Sometimes, I felt like I wasn’t being seen for my intelligence or other qualities.”Around that time, the film producerHarvey Weinsteininvited Graham to his office, and, showing her a pile of scripts, essentially offered her the chance to pick a film to star in. “And then he said something like: ‘My wife and I have an arrangement, and when I’m out of town, I can do whatever I want.’” The implication was clear, and then he tried to hug her.Graham tried to manage it. “In that moment, I wasn’t like: ‘Fuck off.’ I just felt like, oh my God, I don’t know how to handle this situation. How do I get out of this without completely alienating him?”Some time later, Weinstein invited her to dinner and Graham asked a friend, another actor, to come. Her friend cancelled at the last minute. Weinstein, Graham says, called and asked her to meet him in his hotel room instead, claiming that her friend was already there (an obvious lie, Graham having just spoken to her). “I was like, I can’t do this. And then he never worked with me again.”There were other instances, with other men. “There were moments where I do feel like I was being hit on, and moments where I thought people were being inappropriate. It was not happening in every job and, at some moments, I would have more power, like if my career was going really well. I would say most people were not like that. But there’s definitely some creepy people there.”View image in fullscreenAs Rollergirl in the 1997 film Boogie Nights.Photograph: United Archives GmbH/AlamyShe watched the #MeToo movement unfold with a sense of justice restored, and wrote about her own experience with Weinstein (who is now being retried in New Yorkfor rape – which he denies – after his 2020 conviction was overturned). “It felt so exciting to see this powerful guy not get away with it,” says Graham. “Because, from my whole career, people would be like: ‘Just don’t put yourself in that situation, otherwise it’s your fault.’ There was victim shaming, like: ‘You shouldn’t have gone to his hotel room.’”If the situation has improved for women in the entertainment industry in terms of sexual harassment, there is still a way to go in terms of equality. It was a struggle for Graham to get her latest film made. “Most movies are financed based on a male actor attaching themselves,” she says with a smile, “and if it’s not a male-driven story – if the guy’s not this hero, like killing all these people and saving everyone’s lives – it’s sometimes harder to get men to attach. Every independent movie is like: ‘Get the most famous actor you can for no money. And I hope it’s a man.’ If it’s a woman, you need two.” She gives a frustrated laugh.Getting Stiles on board as Ann’s sister, “along with me being in it, got the movie greenlit, so I’m very grateful to her for supporting me and believing in me”.Graham has worked with so many great male directors: Gus Van Sant, Paul Thomas Anderson, David Lynch. Did she ever wonder where the women were? “It’s awesome to work with great male directors,” she says. “But most stories are told from a male point of view so, as a woman, you usually end up being some kind of supporting character. Women’s stories weren’t being told with the same kind of excitement and money and support, and that made me think, well, this affects how women grow up, and how women think about themselves … I think it’s so important that there’s more and more female film-makers now.”She tries to be positive, she says (perhaps thanks to three decades of transcendental meditation, to which Lynch introduced her). “I try not to latch on to defeatist ways of thinking, and believe that the system is always changing.” She feels the same about the state of US politics. “I think it’s really stressful,” she says. “Of course, I’d love to see a woman president. I hope we survive it. I try to just detach from drama and focus on what’s good.”View image in fullscreenWith John Brotherton and Ella Grace Helton in Chosen Family.Photograph: Everett/ShutterstockWhat about roles for older women in notoriously youth-obsessed Hollywood? Recently, she says, she was cast in two parts that were originally written for women in their 30s. “I think there’s a beauty that a woman can have as she gets older that’s like a powerful, sexy beauty. Like, how do you still feel good and sexy about yourself at any age, and just embrace that? Because it really doesn’t matter what other people think – it’s how you feel about yourself. If you feel that you’re hot, you feel hot. And I do feel hot.” She laughs again.Neither Graham nor her Chosen Family character, Ann, are averse to putting bikini photos up on Instagram. I wonder if that’s about seeking validation from others (she looks incredible), but Graham says that’s the wrong way to look at it. “I think I’m just enjoying my sexuality as a woman.”Recovering from being a people pleaser has clearly brought her more contentment. “Before, I was more: ‘What do other people think?’ Now I’m just like, fuck it.”Chosen Family is on digital platformsExplore more on these topicsThe G2 interviewHarvey WeinsteininterviewsShareReuse this content"

It felt like more. The first fully narrative feature by Britain’s best-loved TV sketch troupe is among the most fondly, frequently and recognisably referenced comedies in all cinema; the film’s best scenes are hard to separate from various everyday quotations or pub impressions thereof. Some comedy is made not so much to stand as individual art than to be absorbed into our collective comic language, and so it is with Monty Python, their best work a stew of endlessly imitable idioms and accents, to be relished with or without context.Monty Python’s The Meaning of Life at 40: timeless sketch comedy brillianceRead moreIn all truth, I remembered laughing atMonty Pythonand the Holy Grail more vividly than I remembered exactly what I was laughing at. For this I must blame my late father, whose laughter – loud and barking, often a beat ahead of lines already known and eagerly anticipated – I perhaps recall more vividly than my own. The film was one of a jumbled canon of comedies that, over the course of my childhood, he eagerly presented to my brother and me as apices of the form, with hit-and-miss results. (Paper Moon? Wholly shared joy. Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines? He chuckled alone.) Monty Python and the Holy Grail was among the hits: some giggling fits are too giddy not to catch on.Watching it a second time, on my own, I probably caught a good deal more of the jokes that were drowned out in my childhood, while others that I did remember – notably the famous running debate about the airspeed of a laden swallow – were more dementedly extended and involved than I might have guessed. The real surprise of this return visit, however, was the remarkable strike rate of the gags. I had expected a scattershot affair of lunatic highs and groan-worthy lows, as tends to be the pattern of sketch comedy, but the film’s antic wit is sustained better than its knowingly slipshod narrative and flashes of avant-garde style might suggest. Formally and structurally, the film may have been a chaotically experimental venture for much of the Python team – not least first-time feature directorsTerry Gilliamand Terry Jones – but minute-to-minute jokes? No uncertainty there.It could all have gone terribly wrong, of course. By 1973, when Monty Python and the Holy Grail was conceived, the team’s BBC show Monty Python’s Flying Circus was three series in and well on its way to a curious kind of status somewhere between cult and national treasure. It was popular enough to have already prompted a 1971 film spinoff that was little more than a greatest-hits compilation. Recreating numerous sketches from the show and stringing them together in an attempt to engage the elusive American market, And Now for Something Completely Different was something of a redundant curio – funny, certainly, but hardly cinematic. If the group were to have a big-screen career, they had to think beyond the short-form work they had already mastered. They had to tell a story. Sort of.Arthurian legend had enjoyed a pop culture revival ripe for spoofing: the chintzy Broadway tunes of Lerner and Loewe’s Camelot were still ringing in audiences’ ears by the early 70s, while TH White’s popular tetralogy The Once and Future King had been given the Disney treatment in The Sword in the Stone a decade prior. Reimagining King Arthur – played with wonderfully queer bluster and defensiveness by the late Graham Chapman – and his Knights of the Round Table as an alternately brutal and ineffectual band of dolts, Gilliam and Jones’s film dismantled the macho romanticism of the Matter of Britain in one fell swoop, with a simple running gag that also handily got around the lack of animal-wrangling budget: no horses and just a limp-wristed, lolloping gait and two clopping coconut halves to underline their absence.What is a knight without a steed? About as powerful as a king without a court, both of which apply to poor, hamstrung Arthur here, as he trudges vainly across England in search of who-knows-exactly-what, earning only the contempt of his sceptical, mud-stained subjects (“Just because some watery tart threw a sword at you,” one mutters) and mysteriously invading French adversaries along the way. It’s a healthily republican rejoinder to reams of awed Arthurian lore, sneaking some startlingly pithy class commentary in amid the loopy japing. “I didn’t vote for you,” says one unimpressed countryman to our horseless hero. “You don’t vote for kings,” Arthur counters, as if that answer raises no further questions.Marty at 70: the underdog best-picture winner remains hard to resistRead moreBut if sentimental historical myth-making comes in for a skewering here, so does the drab, earthy severity of the folk-horror wave in 1970s British cinema: extremities of violence and eroticism are here rendered ridiculous, even benign. Gilliam and Jones’s film may be a wilfully shaggy affair, delighting in its absurd logical leaps and blunt narrative dead ends, but it’s consistent in its undermining of rigid British storytelling traditions – not just with the gleefully vulgar anachronisms of the Carry On films, but with its own kind of gonzo political integrity.Half a century on, the film is palpably a product of its era – visible in its own stylings and those of the contemporary works it responds to – but the Python sensibility remains so strangely, dizzilysui generisthat it can’t really date all that much either. The team had more ambitious, polished films in their future: Life of Brian still carries an exhilaratingly subversive punch, while The Meaning of Life returned to the fragmented sketch format with a greater sense of perverse philosophical inquiry. Gilliam’s own flair for baroque lunacy, meanwhile, would reach artsier highs and grisly lows in his ensuing directorial career. But Monty Python and the Holy Grail remains a pure comic peak for him and the collective alike: a film made to be recited by heart, hilarious even as second-hand evocation, and still possessed of pleasures and surprises that generations of cultists haven’t yet spoiled.This article was amended on 28 April 2025 to correct the picture caption which had misnamedMichael Palinas Eric Idle.Explore more on these topicsComedy filmsMonty PythonComedyTerry GilliamEric IdleJohn CleeseMichael PalinfeaturesShareReuse this content"

If it’s not a romcom, or otherwise setting out to impart warm fuzzies, familiarity plays a big part. I’ve seenJawsso many times that watching it now truly feels like sinking into a warm bath.It’s always been my favourite film; I’ve read the book, got the hat,seen the play. (Did you know that, on set, the animatronic shark was called Bruce?) Far from keeping me out of the water, Jaws stoked my interest in marine life, even inspiring me to get my scuba qualification.A few years ago I fulfilled my dream of cage diving with great whites. When the 3-meter-long shark, a juvenile female, heaved into view, it was like spotting a celebrity in the wild – I was starstruck.‘Aspirational in the silliest sense’: why The Lizzie McGuire Movie is my feelgood movieRead moreI appreciate it’s not the standard response toSteven Spielberg’s defining summer blockbuster. When Jaws hit cinemas 50 years ago this June, it had peoplescreaming in their seats; many still credit it with keeping them out of the water.But my parents are passionate sailors and I spent much of my childhood around ports or at sea, meaning Jaws’s maritime setting is less inherently unsettling or alien for me than it may be for the average viewer. There are even moments of cosy recognition: my father had no more success teaching me to tie a bowline knot than Quint (Robert Shaw) does with Brody (Roy Scheider).That is perhaps why the facts spouted by self-described “shark addict” Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) made a greater impression on me than the terrifying attacks – because I understood that they were more representative.Ultimately Jawsproved disastrousfor shark species, encouraging their mass slaughter in game-fishing tournaments and tarring them with a villainous reputation that has persisted through decades of attempted damage control. Sharks may bite people, but very rarely – you are more likely to be killed by a cow – and they certainly don’tseekrevenge.BothSpielberg and Peter Benchley, the late author of the Jaws novel, have expressed regret at its negative impact on sharks. But if you set aside the use of dramatic licence, the film is otherwise quite diligent about matching fear with fascination.After the shark claims its first victim, in what must be one of the most shocking openings in blockbuster history, police chief Brody’s response is to check out a book. “You know people don’t even know how old sharks are!” he exclaims to his wife Ellen.That’s true – as is the fact that tiger sharks, like the one Hooper guts on the dock, really have been known to chow down on car licence plates. That sort of detail gives Jaws’s world a lived-in quality: it seems textured, immediate and real, even for viewers without any particular connection to the ocean. (In 1975, a teenage girl in landlocked Kansaswas hospitalised with psychological trauma, later attributed to “cinematic neurosis” from having recently watched Jaws at the cinema.)On my more recent watches, I’ve been struck most by what a well-made picture it is – at once rich and economical. Spielberg stripped the distractions from Benchley’s novel (such as Hooper’s affair with Ellen) while amping up the humanity of its hero Brody to create a “perfect engine” for adventure (to give Hooper’s awed epithet for the shark).A large part of the “feelgood” satisfaction of watching Jaws, I find, is feeling yourself to be in capable hands – particularly these days, when the most crowd-pleasing blockbusters are typically also bloated and predictable. From the moment Chrissie Watkins sets out for that fateful midnight swim, Jaws hooks you almost as violently as it does her, then for two hours doesn’t let go.There’s no empty dialogue, no wasted shots. The claustrophobic dynamic of Amity Island, the stakes of the imminent high season and Brody’s uneasy authority as an outsider are all established briskly but elegantly.Even the bit parts have punch. Lee Fierro makes the most of the minutes she’s onscreen as the grieving mother of the shark’s second victim, while Murray Hamilton is note-perfect as Amity’s craven mayor (name-checked by Boris Johnson as his pandemic-eraleadership model, in a mystifying moment of self-awareness. Fierro, incidentally, died from Covid-19 in 2020, aged 91).‘Beautifully, awfully funny’: why Withnail and I is my feelgood movieRead moreThe confines of word count don’t permit me to do justice to the three central performances. Suffice to say, the bitchy sniping between Hooper and Quint never fails to delight me (and is made all the more delicious by knowledge of Dreyfuss and Shaw’son-set feud).The heart of the film is Scheider’s Brody, triumphing over the shark when Hooper’s brains and Quint’s brawn fail. JawsfollowsJoseph Campbell’s time-honoured hero’s journey arc, pushing Brody to conquer his fear of water. But the film also endorses his initial trepidation: the mass slaughter of sharks is too far, but the ocean and its inhabitants certainly deserve our respect.Indeed, the truest, most resonant things it has to say are about people – not fish. The thought and care that has gone into each element is why Jaws has endured: it’s a sufficiently watertight picture to sustain a half-century of interpretations, from apandemic parabletoChristian allegory.Yes, it’s about a man-eating shark – but there’s so much more beneath the surface. I find something new to chew on every time.Jaws is available to rent digitally in the US and is on Amazon Prime in the UKExplore more on these topicsJawsMy feelgood movieSteven SpielbergHorror filmsRichard DreyfussAction and adventure filmsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It is seen several times in the film, including during the scene in which the band play the hymn Nearer My God to Thee in an attempt to calm passengers as the ship sinks.As they conclude, Hartley says: “Gentlemen, it has been a privilege playing with you tonight.” All of the musicians onboard the Titanic were among the 1,500 people who lost their lives when the ship sank in the Atlantic ocean after hitting an iceberg.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Henry Aldridge and Son Ltd/PAIn 2013, Evans-Jones sold the violin at auction to a private collector, who put it up for sale with Henry Aldridge & Son auctioneers.Other lots sold on Sunday include a letter written by one of the most well-known survivors of the Titanic disaster, Colonel Archibald Gracie, which sold for £300,000, and a rare Titanic manifest sheet and inspection card.Cameron’s multi-Oscar-winning film starred Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio as passengers who meet and fall in love on the voyage, despite a class divide.Speaking on the Graham Norton Show to promote her Lee Miller biopic last year, Winslet said she was surprised to see Evans-Jones again when watching the soundtrack to the film – which she also produced – being recorded.“I was looking through the glass into the stage where all the musicians are,” she said. “Huge, 120-piece orchestra. And I’m looking at this violinist and I thought, ‘I know that face.’ And then the day goes on, and a few of the musicians start going, ‘It’s [him]!’ and they’re sort of pointing at him.“I’m thinking, ‘Am I related to this person? Who is this person?’ And at the end of the day, I thought, “OK, I’ve got to go in.’ So I went in, and he went, ‘Kate, it’s me!’ You know when the Titanic is going down, and the violinist stands up, and he goes, ‘Come on, lads,’ and he starts playing? It was that guy! I’m like, ‘It’s you!’ It was wonderful.”Evans-Jones’s movie credits also include No Time to Die, Kung Fu Panda 4 and Wicked.Explore more on these topicsFilmTitanicThe TitanicnewsShareReuse this content"

It is believed that Hackman died around a week after his wife, whose cause of death was hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, a rare rodent-borne disease.Hackman’s autopsy “showed severe atherosclerotic and hypertensive cardiovascular disease with placement of coronary artery stents and a bypass graft, as well as a previous aortic valve replacement,” said the report, which was obtained by Fox News Digital.“Remote myocardial infarctions were present involving the left ventricular free wall and the septum, which were significantly large. Examination of the brain showed microscopic findings of advanced stage Alzheimer’s disease.”According to the autopsy, Hackman had been fitted with a “bi-ventricular pacemaker” since April 2019. His estimated date of death was determined by the last recorded activity on this device, while Arakawa’s was judged to be 12 February – the last date she corresponded by email or telephone.It is understood that Hackman might not have appreciated his wife was dead in the six days after her passing, such was the level of his dementia.The autopsy also noted Hackman had a “history of congestive heart failure” as well as “severe chronic hypertensive changes, kidneys” and “neurodegenerative features consistent with Alzheimer’s disease”.Early investigations ruled out death by carbon monoxide poisoning, while a necropsy report confirmed that Arakawa had died from hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, a rare rodent-borne disease.Confusion over the circumstances of the death of Hackman, Arakawa and their kelpie mix, Zinna, has persisted since the discovery of their bodies (two other dogs were found alive and well).Initial suspicions that they died of a gas leak or carbon monoxide poisoning were confounded by the findings that Arakawa had died of the rare respiratory condition.Hantavirus pulmonary disease is fatal in nearly four out of 10 people who are infected, but fewer than 730 cases were identified in the US between 1993 and 2017.Further police investigations of their grounds discovered widespread evidence of rodent infestation. Meanwhile, recently released body cam footage of the local police department’s first visit to the property suggested the couple may have struggled to keep their home under control, while a discarded plaster indicated Arakawa might have been bitten by a rodent.Further questions have also been raised about why the couple did not have a more robust care package in place.Explore more on these topicsFilmGene HackmanHealth & wellbeingAlzheimer'sHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

In that moment – an innocent, critical, life-changing moment – that tiny but monumental slip of the mind would change the course of my life for ever.”The actor describes how he believed Fries would be crushed between his snowcat and a truck was parked 10 feet away, and so leapt towards the controls in an attempt to hit the “stop” button, shouting “Not today, motherfucker” as he jumped.Instead, Renner lost his footing and was propelled on to the ice in front of the truck, “where my head hit the ground hard and instantly gashed open”.Renner continued: “There came terrible crunching sounds as 14,000lb of galvanised steel machinery slowly, inexorably, monotonously, ground over my body. It was a horrifying soundtrack.View image in fullscreenA horrifying soundtrack … Renner recovering in hospital.Photograph: Jeremy Renner InstagramRenner suffered 38 broken bones in the accident, as well as a collapsed lung and his liver was pierced by one of his broken ribs. The actor said he remained conscious throughout: “I knew that my skull was split like a watermelon, my brain pulverised like meat.”He describes in detail the pain of every one of the snowcat’s wheels and tracks passing over him and feeling his bones give way. “Skull, jaw, cheekbones, molars; fibula, tibia, lungs, eye sockets, cranium, pelvis, ulna, legs, arms, skin; crack, snap, crack, squeeze, crack. More sounds: a ringing in the ears, as if a gun had unloaded next to my head. A sting of bright white in my eyes – I was blinded by a coruscating lightning, a lightning that signals the break of my orbital bone, causing my left eyeball to violently burst out of my skull.”Fries administered first aid until emergency responders arrived and airlifted Renner to hospital. He spent two weeks there and had multiple surgeries. On his first day at home, Renner described how he headed “straight for my bar. I stood up out of my wheelchair, still on shattered legs, and poured myself a huge glass of red wine.”The actor has since regained much of his physical function, appeared in the TV show Echo and shot Wake Up Dead Man, the third Knives Out movie.His memoir is published on 29 April, and writing it was, he toldPeople, a cathartic experience.“I don’t not talk about it,” he said. “It’s part of my life every day, and it’s always a wonderful reminder of the strength of the human spirit and how fragile the body is and how badass it is at recovery.”My Next Breath by Jeremy Renner (Simon & Schuster Ltd, £22).

The people whose remarkable stories we gathered have plenty to say.”The play features the reflections of a steelworker, Ian Lewis, whose garage the artist chose for his work; a security guard, Kevin Gregory, who had the tough task of protecting it; and the Essex art dealer John Brandler, who bought the mural. “It’s been an extraordinary process, generating a script full of anger, but also incredible resilience and laugh-out-loud humour,” said Jenkins.The Banksy appeared, as if by witchcraft, in the Taibach area of the town, close to the Tata steelworks (and thechildhood home of Richard Burton). From one angle it showed a child apparently trying to catch snowflakes on their tongue. From another it became clear that what is falling on the child is ash.Tens of thousands of people visited and round-the-clock security was introduced to protect the artwork. It also created a cottage industry in souvenirs – mugs, coasters, keyrings – carrying images of the work.Brandler, bought the piece from Lewis and in May 2019 the Banksy, all 4.5 tonnes of it,was moved to a temporary exhibition spacein the town. No permanent spot in the area could be found and on a bitterly cold February 2022 the piecewas taken away on the back of a lorry.Season’s Greetings is being exhibited alongside other works, by Banksy and Andy Warhol, in Rome. It is possible it could be heading to India and China to be shown there.View image in fullscreenPaul Reynolds and Rob Parsons campaigned t keep the Banksy mural in the town.Photograph: Kara Thomas/Athena Pictures/The GuardianBrandler said he was “angry and frustrated” that Neath Port Talbot council had not found a way of keeping the Banksy but said he was pleased the play would tell the story. The council is unapologetic, saying it would have been too expensive to install it in a new venue and cover insurance and loan fees.But good came out of it. The Banksy may be gone but it has led to a street-art boom in Port Talbot.Bev Simmonds Owen, one of the leaders of a street-art trail in Port Talbot, said: “Since the Banksy appeared we have had over 150 new pieces of street art in the local area. We created careers for at least four local street/mural artists. We have had artists go into local school and teach street art.”Simmonds Owen said the biggest achievement had been the Bridge Street gallery, an open air space that attracts street artists from across the UK. “It changes monthly and there is a huge variety of art styles often of different topical issues or themes and it costs the local tax payers nothing. There is no entry fee, making art accessible for everyone in our community.”Simmonds Owen pointed out that the Hollywood stars Richard Burton, Anthony Hopkins and Michael Sheen had strong Port Talbot links. “I think that the Banksy was a huge instigator for the community to find a new pride in our history as an important and historical place for the arts.”View image in fullscreenThe Banksy mural has led to a street art explosion across Port Talbot.Photograph: Kara Thomas/Athena Pictures/The GuardianThere is a fresh piece of art on the Banksy garage, a piece by Steve Jenkins highlighting the issue of pollution from cars in the town.He said: “The Banksy lit touchpaper for art in the area. I think it should have stayed in Port Talbot as anywhere else it’s seen totally out of context. It need the stack of the steelworks visible in the distance to make it perfect.”When the fight was on to keep the Banksy in Port Talbot, Paul Reynolds, who owns the motorbike shop Kickstart nearby, displayed posters in his shop windows calling for it to stay. He still keeps them rolled upstairs. “Sad, really. It’s great that we’ve got all this new street art. It gives the place some colour. But the Banksy should still be here.”Port Talbot’s Gotta Banksy will be performed at Shermantheatre in Cardiff from 2-10 May 2025, then at theNew Plaza, Port Talbot; Swansea Grandtheatre; Torchtheatre, Milford Haven andTŷ Pawb, Wrexham.Explore more on these topicsWalesTheatreBanksynewsShareReuse this content"

Of course, the trick with multidisciplinary work is to ensure that one form doesn’t overwhelm the others, and this Royal Philharmonic take on Shostakovich’s epic Leningrad Symphony, with imagery by Russian art/film director Kirill Serebrennikov and video artist Ilya Shagalov, got the balance just right.A brief first half offered a thrusting reading of Sibelius’s Finlandia, a more straightforwardly patriotic work than Shostakovich’s tantalisingly equivocal symphony. ConductorVasily Petrenkoproved a master of dramatic contrasts, from the opening rasp of low brass to the composer’s final proclamation of nationhood.Kurt Weill’s Four Walt Whitman Songs were equally effective, thanks to Roderick Williams’ honest simplicity and razor-sharp diction. The German expat’s gawky settings of nationalistic poetry have the potential to get chopped up and tossed into word salads, but not with Williams at the helm. Firm-toned and equally firmly committed, he landed all four with musical panache and lyrical insight.As for the symphony, Serebrennikov and Shagalov allowed Petrenko’s blistering, multi-hued interpretation of Shostakovich’s cinematic masterpiece to command centre stage. Their absorbing but never over-fussy illustrations offered extra-cerebral stimulation with evocative and occasionally provocative imagery playing out on three giant screens.Shostakovich’s four movements were visualised as a series of discrete yet interconnected narratives, broadening the storyline from Soviet resilience in the face of the destruction of Leningrad (whether by Hitler or, as Shostakovich once suggested, by Stalin) to the impact of man’s technological overreach on the planet. The live-guided imagery, which referenced 20th-century constructivism and contemporary sci-fi, was inspired, from a psychedelically infused eyeball scanning the heavens to the blood-red vegetation of a haunted forest.The opening Allegretto channelled the Icarus myth, the on-screen action going cheek-by-jowl with Petrenko’s masterly build of Shostakovich’s battle theme. In contrast, the light-footed second movement was accompanied by dancing cells and synapses. A poignant, post-apocalyptic Adagio led into an intense, emotional finale where Technicolor flowers blossomed as vividly as Shostakovich’s music. Petrenko, visibly moved at the end, never put a foot wrong.Multitudes, atLondon’s Southbank Centre, continues until 3 May.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicVasily PetrenkoRoyal Philharmonic OrchestrareviewsShareReuse this content"

Now she has written and directed this satirical caper with an Ealingesque premise: a bunch of depressed people in East Germany in 1990, with reunification a few days away, discover an old storage depot with tons of abandoned and soon-to-be-worthless ostmarks – ostmarks galore, in fact – and not much time left for sneakily exchanging them for deutschemarks at the accepted (and humiliating) rate of two to one.But how to explain this mountain of cash? Sandra Hüller plays a woman called Maren who, with husband Robert (Max Riemelt), leads the plan while Ronald Zehrfeld plays Volker, with whom Maren has some emotional history. Veteran player Peter Kurth brings his mighty presence to the role of Markowski, Robert’s glowering dad and disaffected state security guard working at the depot who puts them on to the scam.It’s an interesting time to be making a movie about the old GDR, a place whose economic privation and longterm alienation is said to have made it a breeding ground for Germany’s new far right. Around 20 years ago,Wolfgang Becker’s comedy Good Bye Lenin!brought a similar satirical flavour to its Rip Van Winkle fable of a fiercely communist East Berliner who succumbs to a coma just before the fall of the Wall and on regaining consciousness later is not permitted to discover the awful truth about communism’s collapse.There is a fair bit of spark and fun in the opening act of this goofy comedy, a bit like Danny Boyle’s children’s movie Millions (and how extraordinary to remember, incidentally, that all the talk at the time was of the Wessis’ economic hardship, having to swallow up these shiftless eastern ex-communists). But there’s not much clarity or discipline to the script itself. First the scam revolves around discreetly buying up consumer items such as microwaves from door-to-door salesmen who still accept ostmarks and sharing these items out or (presumably) reselling them; then it’s a matter of finding foreign-domiciled state apparatchiks who are allowed leeway on exchanging cash after the deadline. There’s also an unlikely and dramatically unexciting plot point about using the cash to revive the old factory for the community’s benefit – so the film’s audience understands that the characters are not just greedy.This longish movie jumps the shark around halfway through the running time and loses focus. Hüller is at any rate always a potent, attractive presence.Two to One is in UK cinemas from 2 May.Explore more on these topicsFilmCrime filmsComedy filmsPeriod and historical filmsGermanyComedyEuropereviewsShareReuse this content"

Blurring the lines between genres and styles, the first half of the film unfurls through a technique commonly seen in silent cinema: the iris shot. Within a circular frame we see a burglary gone wrong, a puzzling plaster cast in the shape of a woman and the burgeoning of a strange friendship, all set within an ordinary flat.Inspired by a news story, the central premise is at once macabre and moving. Inside the plaster cast is the body of the owner’s wife, who died 10 years ago. Having caught a young burglar (Psycho Neo) red handed, the older man (Lưu Đức Cường) asks for his help on an unusual quest: transporting the body to the couple’s chosen resting place in a faraway desert. Though powered by love, it’s also a journey towards death.The circular compositions are exquisitely detailed and far from being a gimmick. There’s a captivating play with geometry as cascading shadows, vertical columns, and square floor tiles nestle within the round border. Viewed as if through a telescope, objects of devotion – a fading photo, a pair of wedding rings – acquire a spiritual poignancy. In addition to emphasising the voyeuristic nature of cinema, the framing beautifully accentuates minute gestures and expressions, as the bond between the two men gradually grows. The vivid colour palette, reminiscent of Technicolor melodramas, is another delight, transforming mundane routines into painterly still lifes.As the film shifts gears into spaghetti western mode, the frame widens to take in new terrain. The switch is beguiling, even if the second half loses some of the visual intricacy that makes the previous scenes so thrilling. Nevertheless, Bury Us in a Lone Desert shines as a potent and affecting exploration of grief’s peculiarities, one that sidesteps maudlin sentimentality.Bury Us in a Lone Desert is at the ICA, London, from 2 May.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsVietnamAsia PacificreviewsShareReuse this content"

It’s irresistible: he plunges in. The water under the falls is turbulent, a thousand little fists punching his shoulders. He’s exhilarated. No one could mistake this for a “dying” river, sluggish or polluted. But that thought sparks others: “Is this thing I’m in reallyalive? By whose standards? By what proof? As for speaking to or for a river, or comprehending what a river wants – well, where would you even start?”He’s in the right place to be asking. In September 2008, Ecuador, “this small country with a vast moral imagination”, became the first nation in the world to legislate on behalf of water, “since its condition as an essential element for life makes it a necessary aspect for existence of all living beings”. This enshrinement of the Rights of Nature set off similar developments in other countries. In 2017, a law was passed in New Zealand that afforded the Whanganui River protection as a “spiritual and physical entity”. In India, five days later, judges ruled that the Ganges and Yamuna should be recognised as “living entities”. And in 2021, the Mutehekau Shipu (AKA Magpie River) became the first river in Canada to be declared a “legal person [and] living entity”. The Rights of Nature movement has now reached the UK, with Lewes council in East Sussex recognising the rights and legal personhood of the River Ouse.Macfarlane’s book is timely. Rivers are in crisis worldwide. They have been dammed, poisoned, reduced to servitude, erased from the map. In the UK, “a gradual, desperate calamity” has befallen them, with annual sewage dumps (recorded by a tracker calledTop of the Poops) at despicable levels. “Generational amnesia” means that young people don’t know what clean rivers are. Macfarlane wants them to revive – and to remind us of the interconnectedness of the human and natural world, as captured in a Māori proverb: “I am the river; the river is me.”The river flows through him, a process mirrored in the prose, which rushes in long, ecstatic paragraphs that allow themselves commas but resist full stopsMany Indigenous communities believe that rivers are conscious, with souls, intelligence, even memory. Macfarlane is less a philosopher wrestling with notions of sentience and pan-psychism than he is a nature writer, the author of memorable books about mountains, landscape andunderworlds, as well as a celebrant of words (acorn, bluebell, kingfisher, otter, etc) he fears children no longer know. He’s also a dauntless traveller and in his new book records trips to India and Canada as well as Ecuador. To the question “Is a river alive?” he wants to answer as simply and resoundingly as his nine-year-old son did: yes! And he wills himself to believe it by granting rivers human pronouns: instead ofwhichorthat, “I prefer to speak of riverswhoflow”. But it’s a long journey, with many challenges along the way.He begins with a modest outing, to the springs near his home in Cambridge which, in the summer of 2022, the hottest on record, have all but dried up. He’ll see what a dead river looks like in southern India but inEcuador’s cloud forest, Los Cedros, it’s a happier story: here’s water saved from “pollutocrats” by Ecuador’s progressive constitution. But not all is as secure as it ought to be. Andean forests and rivers have been wrecked by logging, farming and mining. And a young anti-mining activist, five months pregnant, has just been shot dead in the north of Ecuador.View image in fullscreenThe Whanganui River, New Zealand, protected as a ‘spiritual and physical entity’.Photograph: Gabor Kovacs/AlamyMacfarlane, at least, is among allies. He meets eco-centric lawyers as well as a shambling, bearded castaway, Josef DeCoux, who has fought to protect the river and cloud forest for decades. He’s awed by their tireless resistance to corporate profiteering and feels companioned by the forest: “Lushness beyond imagination. Greenness beyond measure.”His prose aspires to poetry throughout. Fireflies “score the dark like slow tracer bullets”. Flamingos “stand in their own reflections, doubled like playing-card queens, blushing the water pink”. Glow-worms “put tapers on their yellow lantern”. Shooting stars are “scratches on the world’s tin”. A half moon is a “clipped coin”. He so rarely falters in his “love-language” for the natural world that when he describes the sun, near Chennai, “rising red as a Coke can over the ocean” it feels bathetic. But bathos is the point: along with plastic bottles, turds and effluents, the Coke can is emblematic of a polluted coastline.Chennaiis the most dispiriting of Macfarlane’s visits. The River Adyar, reeking and sewage-stricken, is “as close to death as any river I have seen in my life”. And the Ennore Creek, a site of heavy industry, hasn’t just been infilled, built over and surrendered to heavy industry, but has been erased from the official government map, as if it didn’t exist: annihilation cartography. Amid the toxins, hope for rivers is hard to find.He’s instructed by an Innu poet and activist: Don’t think too much with your head … You will be transported by the riverHe is cheered by a trip to a lakeside waterbird sanctuary (“an avian Venice”) and by rescuing turtle eggs on a beach. Still, here and elsewhere doubts creep in. He’s a researcher, not an animist (the book has 50 pages of notes). Are Rights of Nature “an over-enchanted dream”? How compatible is the “stiff discourse’” of rights with a dashing, quicksilver river? “For those who, like me, have been largely raised on rationalism, to imagine a river is alive in a way that exceeds the sum of the lives it contains is difficult, counterintuitive work,” he says. “It requires unlearning, a process much harder than learning.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

When he and his companions go over scary rapids it’s as if he’s been “flooded from within”, the river flowing through him, a process mirrored in the prose, which rushes in long, ecstatic paragraphs that allow themselves commas but resist full stops. The river is under threat from damming but Macfarlane himself is released, surrendering agency to the water, pantheistically enraptured by “some vast and unknowable other life-way”.“The river has great wisdom and whispers its secrets to the hearts of men,” Mark Twain said. It’s not just Macfarlane who bears this out but the three people he spends most time with on his travels: the eerily intuitive mycologist Giuliana in Ecuador, the geomancer Wayne in Canada and the ecologist Yuvan in India with his “ductile, fast-flowing mind”. All are grieving when they begin their journeys after the death of someone they loved. But the river consoles and even heals them: “I felt my power return,” Giuliana says.Here’s another reason to fight for the Rights of Nature – not just to save rivers and forests, but to save ourselves. “The tale of a dying river / Does not end where you stand with the visitors / at a sickbed,” Ted Hughes wrote in his poetry collection River, four decades ago. The battle is to save rivers as living beings. Macfarlane’s impassioned book shows the way, ending on a riskily lyrical high with his arrival as a waterbody complete: “I am rivered.”Is a River Alive? by Robert Macfarlane is published by Hamish Hamilton (£25).

Such is the frantic way of this Chinese cartoon franchise, as relentless and exhausting as ever in its 11th feature-film instalment. Five minutes in, before the credits, it has crammed in a post-apocalyptic prologue, oodles of eco-babble, a time-travelling tyke and an avalanche.This latest one jumps on the fungal-panic bandwagon: Saylor (voiced by Nicola Vincent in the English-language version) has nipped back 100 years to locate the original spores at the root of a pestilence that has eradicated most of life on Earth. It turns out that hapless nature guide Vick (Chris Boike), seen polluting the forest with his tourists, was responsible for spreading them After Saylor fails to kill the mushroom in the cradle, the pair – along with Vick’s forest buddies, the bears Bramble (Joseph S Lambert) and Briar (Patrick Freeman) – are whisked back to the future. They discover a fungus-carpeted nightmare of a planet, overshadowed by a giant skyscraping toadstool.As the fellowship traverses this wasteland, the film is a mycological Mad Max, souped up with some mech bolt-ons when they arrive at the floating city run by overbearing mayor Trystan (Christopher Price). The animation is impressive as far as blighted panoramas and meteor-like spore storms go. But the main character models are oddly denuded and doll-like – reflecting a general lack of effort with the protagonists from director Lin Yongchang, who helmed the last two instalments. Beyond fart-centric comic relief, Bramble and Briar have nothing to do (the animators at least convincingly flesh out pudgy ursine hindquarters).This noisy rampage somehow squeezes out room for bursts of screwy humour that featured in previous Boonie Bears outings. The authoritarian villainy and family revelations are as half-baked as the eco-messaging is trite and sanctimonious. A heavier dose of the psychedelic shrooms might have taken this somewhere interesting.Boonie Bears: Future Reborn is in cinemas now.Explore more on these topicsFilmAnimation in filmFamily filmsScience fiction and fantasy filmsChinaAsia PacificreviewsShareReuse this content"

But at least Sisyphus gets to roll his boulder, she cries! At least it happens outside! There’s no wiping in sight!Sara Pascoe: ‘I still identify as an infertile, childless woman’Read moreThere are glancing disclaimers – Pascoe loves her children and considers them nothing short of miraculous, a gift facilitated by IVF – but these are just as quickly dismissed and forgotten as the hour becomes a funny but thrillingly relentless refusal to name a single positive thing about being a mother.Instead, she makes sharp comedic work out of the often unspoken and frequently downplayed disruptions that must be endured to effectively care for babies: the alarming amount of sleep deprivation that leads to Pascoe questioning her very sense of self. Is she her body? Is her body herself? Is she a gas that sits behind her eyes, waiting to escape? Then there’s the never-ending housework and the changes to her body, which she vividly describes as “a patina of stretch marks and varicose veins, covered in a crust of breast milk and squashed banana”.There’s also the learned incompetence of her husband who, like many, won’t contribute to chores because he claims they are simply too complicated to understand. Pascoe’s husband is theAustralian actor and writerSteen Raskopoulos, and she doesn’t perform any obligatory politenesses for the local audience, instead highlighting the inequities still too often baked into contemporary marriages when it comes tomental load, childcare and housework.But the show isn’t confessional or confrontational: it’s conversational. The set tumbles out with Pascoe’s endearingly scatty delivery. Early on she invites us to imagine we’re at a lightly tipsy catch-up with a friend, and that sets the tone for her joyfully silly asides into dubious anti-aging interventions, the value of poetry, how the Bible could do with a rewrite, and references to comedy films from the 80s. There’s a sense of catharsis: an expunging of injustices, late-night wonderings and drudgery.There’s an edge of rebellion to Pascoe’s simple refusal to glorify motherhood: it sidesteps the social rituals we’ve deemed acceptable for mothers, whose complaints – if they are ever aired – are often countered by an exaltation of benevolent love for children and partner that makes all the sacrifice worth it.Pascoe gives the audience permission to laugh, long and loud, and join in on that liberating rejection of the good mother act. Behind me, women kept saying to each other, between bursts of laughter, “That’s so true!” and “Exactly!” What a gift Pascoe offers here to mothers in the audience – to have a space to place your selfhood first in a world that discourages exactly that.I Am a Strange Gloopis on in Perth on 2 May before touring across the UK from JuneExplore more on these topicsComedyParents and parentingFamilyreviewsShareReuse this content"

This documentary rounds up the lowlights, from setting fire to half the global economy to being childishly rude to Volodymyr Zelenskyy and threatening to invade Greenland.Jack Seale999: The Critical List9pm, Channel 4Rett syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that can cause an inability to speak – so, despite Emma being rushed to theatre, doctors are struggling to diagnose her in this week’s life-or-death emergency case. Meanwhile, Vanessa, 61, must decide whether to undergo high-risk surgery, and horse rider Julie has waited three days for surgery on a painful abscess.Ali CatterallP Diddy: The Rise and Fall9pm, BBC ThreeIn May, Sean “Diddy” Combs will go on trial for five criminal allegations of sexual offences and racketeering – he denies them and has pleaded not guilty to all counts.

It’s a tedious affair, as a group of tanned and toned single contestants (or “trutopians”) in a villa are matched up, then asked to step into “the honesty box” – an 88% accurate lie detector that asks questions about past relationships and their current feelings. Vicky Pattison is our host, along with “sincerity coach” Lucinda Light, who Married at First Sight Australia fans will be sure to recognise.HRThe Last of Us9pm, Sky AtlanticEveryone’s favourite game-to-TV adaptation took a shocking turn last week (at least for those who hadn’t already played The Last of Us Part II). With Abby (Kaitlyn Dever) making good on her promise to slowly and painfully kill Joel (Pedro Pascal), will Ellie (Bella Ramsey) be the next one to take revenge?HJDExplore more on these topicsTelevisionTV tonightfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Telling you to stir whole peas through orzo feels a bit too much like nursery food, but if you are serving this to small children who are amenable to pesto pasta (mine are not), I’d suggest finely blitzing the pumpkin seeds before adding them to the pesto, because they’re quite large pieces otherwise. Top with seasonal asparagus and this is the perfect dinner to eat outdoors on a warm spring evening.Asparagus, pea and lemon orzottoPrep15 minCook15 minServes2Sea salt flakes180g orzo200g asparagus50ml olive oil, plus 1 tbsp extra for the asparagus180g podded fresh peas, or frozen peas50g pumpkin seeds50g parmesan, grated (a vegetarian one, if need be)Juice of½ lemonBring a large pan of well-salted water to a boil, then tip in the orzo and cook for eight minutes, or until cooked through but still a bit al dente. Drain well, and reserve a mugful of the cooking water.Meanwhile, set a griddle pan on a high heat. Toss the asparagus with a tablespoon of oil to coat, then grill for two minutes on each side (you may need to do this in batches). Transfer to a plate and scatter with some sea salt flakes.Meanwhile, blanch the peas by tipping them into a bowl of boiling water, leave to steep for two minutes (or three minutes if using frozen), then drain well. Tip the peas into a food processor, add 50ml oil, the pumpkin seeds and the grated parmesan, and blitz to a coarse paste.Try this recipe and many more of Rukmini’s recipes on the new Feast app: scan or clickherefor your free trial.Stir three-quarters of the pea pesto through the drained orzo, adding a couple of tablespoons of the pasta cooking water to loosen, if need be – you want the pasta to flow gently across the plate, rather than sit in a big heap. Taste and add lemon juice and salt as needed (if your pasta water was well salted to begin with, you shouldn’t need much).Divide the orzo between warmed shallow bowls, top with the remaining pea pesto and the griddled asparagus, and serve at once.Explore more on these topicsFoodQuick and easyMain courseSpring food and drinkVegetablesPastaCheeseNuts and seedsrecipesShareReuse this content"

Sometimes, I crave a buttery bowl of carbs, but one that’s layered with the bold, fishy flavours of Malaysia. This bucatini with prawns is one of my favourite meals when no one is watching. And when I’m short on time but craving squidgy carbs tangled with spiced lamb mince, the cuminy noodles are my self-loving pleasure. Completely incorrect in its origins, but undeniably delicious.Absolutely not ‘ground cumin lamb noodles’ (pictured top)I’m heinously using torn lasagne sheets as a quick fix for the gloriously thick, chewy ribbons of noodles that I adore (especially the cumin-heavy ones fromNoodle and Beerin London).Prep10 minCook30 minServes1150g lamb mince1½ tsp ground cuminA pinch of MSG1½ tsp pul biber, or aleppo pepper or mild chilli flakesSalt4 dried lasagne sheetsVegetable oil3-4 Sichuan peppercorns2garlic cloves, peeled and finely minced½thumb-sized piece of ginger,peeled and minced1 tbsp light soy sauce½tbsp dark soy sauce1 tbsp Chinkiang black vinegar½tsp sugar1 tsp chilli bean paste– doubanjiang or similar2–3 stalkschoi sum, cut into 3-4cm chunksTo serveCrispy chilli oilToasted sesame seeds1 sprig coriander, leaves choppedIn a bowl, mix the lamb with a teaspoon of ground cumin, the MSG and a teaspoon of pul biber, then set aside.Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Break the lasagne into rough shards and cook according to the packet instructions, until al dente. Reserve a splash of the pasta cooking water, then drain.Heat a tablespoon of vegetable oil in a wok or deep frying pan, then add the Sichuan peppercorns and fry until fragrant and just popping. Add the lamb mince mix and fry on a medium-high heat until deeply browned and crisp at the edges; if the mix looks a little dry, add a touch more oil.Stir in the garlic and ginger, fry until soft and fragrant, then add the cooked lasagne pieces and toss well to separate. Stir through both soy sauces, vinegar and sugar, and add a splash of the reserved pasta water if it’s looking dry – it should be glossy and saucy, but not soupy.Add the chilli bean paste and the remaining cumin and pul biber. Stir to coat the noodles, then toss in the choi sum and cook for a minute or so, until it just wilts and turns bright green. Adjust the seasoning to taste, adding chilli oil if you want it spicier (though I always put it on top when serving).Serve hot, topped with toasted sesame seeds and fresh coriander, and with chilli oil to taste.Butter sambal bucatini with prawnsView image in fullscreenJulie Lin’s butter sambal bucatini with prawns.Prep5 minCook25 minServes1150g dried bucatiniSalt6 shell-on prawns30g cold diced butter2–3garlic cloves, peeled and finely minced1 tbspsambalbelacan, or sambalikan bilis, plus extra to serve½ tsp chickenstock powder½ tspMSGLemon juice, to taste2 tbsp double cream3 tbsp grated pecorino1-2 sprigs fresh dill, to garnishCook the pasta in boiling salted water for about eight minutes, until al dente, then drain, reserving some of pasta cooking water.Meanwhile, season the prawns with salt.
