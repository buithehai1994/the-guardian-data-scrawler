So don’t give up on us – and always remember, we’re not all like himThu 25 Dec 2025 13.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 25 Dec 2025 15.10 ESTShareIhave no idea if you know who I am, but I was asked to deliver this year’salternative Christmas message(which I’ve heard is a big deal) so I hope you do, but if notI hostwhat you call a chatshow (we call it a talkshow) in what you call the colonies, I think? I honestly have no idea what’s going on over there.I do know what’s going on overherethough, and I can tell you that, from a fascism perspective, this has been a really great year. Tyrannyis boomingover here.You may have read in your colourful newspapers that my country’s president would like to shut me up – because I don’t adore him in the way he likes to be adored. The American government made a threat against me and the company I work for, and all of a suddenwe were off the air. But then, you know what happened? A Christmas miracle happened. Well, it was September. It was a September miracle. But the holiday does seem to come earlier and earlier every year, doesn’t it?View image in fullscreenJimmy Kimmel delivering Channel 4’s 2025 alternative Christmas message.Photograph: Channel 4/PAMillions and millions of people stood up and said: “No, this is not acceptable.” People who never watched my show, people who were on record saying they hate my show spoke out,they marched. They did this all to support the right to a free expression of speech – and because so many people spoke out, we came back. Our show came backstronger than ever. We won, the president lost – and now I’m back on the air every night, givin’ the most powerful politician on Earth a right, and richly deserved, bollocking. That’s a word, right – I used it properly?And the reason I’m telling you this story is because maybe you’re thinking: “Oh a government silencing its critics is something that happens in places like Russia, or North Korea, or LA, not the UK.” Well, that’s what we thought, and now we’ve got King Donny the Eighthcalling for executions. It happens fast.View image in fullscreenUS presidential candidate Donald Trump appearing on ABC’s Jimmy Kimmel Live, 16 December 2015.Photograph: Randy Holmes/Getty ImagesYou know, it’s funny, we Americans are very proud of not having a king. It’s kind of why we left. Earlier this year tens of millions of us marched at protestscalled No Kings. You had some of those there. And just for the record we have nothing against your king. I mean I don’t know if you know this, buthis son lives here. We just – well some of us – have a problem with the guy who thinks he is our king.Here in the United States right now, we are both figuratively and literally tearing down the structures of our democracy. From the free press, to science, to medicine, to judicial independence, tothe actual White House itself, we are a right mess. And we know this is also affecting you, and I just wanted to say sorry. And we want you to know or, at least I want you to know, that we’re not all like him. We’re not all like that.Look I know (fromthe musical Hamilton) that our countries didn’t start off on the greatest note, but I also know (from seeingLove Actually) that we have a special relationship. So, if I might speak on behalf of my country – which I most certainly do not – our message to you, our friends across the pond this Christmas is: don’t give up on us. We’re going through a bit of a wobble right now, but we’ll come around. It may not seem like it, but we love you guys. We even love the things about you that you don’t like. Like Simon Cowell,for instance. We are not bright. We’re Americans. No one knows better than you we’re always just a little bit late to the game, but do we come through in the end? Maybe. Give us about three years. Please. Thank you for your patience, and thank youfor Spider-Man. Merry Christmas, and happy holidays.Jimmy Kimmel is the host ofJimmy Kimmel Live.

They’re all clearly still friendly, which makes for seasonal TV that’s exactly as comforting as it should beLucy ManganThu 25 Dec 2025 16.15 ESTShareIt’s 22 years sincePeep Showbegan its nine-season run. God, weren’t we all happier then? With the possible exception, ironically, of its beleaguered leads Mark (David Mitchell) and Jez (Robert Webb) – though whether Jez, who made the average whelk look like a philosopher king, ever had the psychological capacity to be beleaguered, I’m not sure. Never mind. Mark was surely beleaguered enough for both of them.Whatever. Jesse Armstrong, Sam Bain and Andrew O’Connor’s breakthrough show was a joy – however agonisingly painful at times. What’s more, it is lovely to see the old gang again: this time in the spotlessly clean environs of the Bake Off tent instead of a shabby Croydon flat painted various shades of B&Q’s Miasmic Despair range, for The Great Christmas Bake Off.(An aside, but theming a Bake Off Christmas special around a show and a group of actors who are still clearly friendly with one another is my device of choice, by the way. Bringing former competitors back or playing series winners off against one another is not the way. By this stage of the festive proceedings, the merest hint of competition between people who can genuinely bake and for whom it might be of any importance at all to be seen to be doing their best, with all the potential for disaster that such a position implies, would undo me. Bring me no-stakes television only, from now until the new year. Ideally on a tray full of cheese straws. Thank you.)View image in fullscreen‘Four cakes? That’s insane’ … David Mitchell in The Great Christmas Bake Off.Photograph: Channel 4/Love Productions/Mark Bourdillon/PADavid Mitchell is here. It is his second time in the tent; he went up against Michael Sheen, Jameela Jamil and Sarah Brown for 2015’s Comic Relief. He has only baked four cakes in his life and two of those occasions have been broadcast: “A rate of being televised even Delia Smith cannot match.” He’s a bright lad, we know, but he is to his detriment foxed by a timer. Isy Suttie, who played Mark’s idiosyncratic and frequently disappointed love interest, Dobby, has an artistic bent that bodes well for success – at least in the decorative aspects of the endeavour.Matt King (Super Hans) once worked as a chef. He has never, he says, watched a single episode of either Peep Show or Bake Off (“What’s that?”). Co-presenter Alison Hammond cannot believe this. She says she doesn’t watch the episodes of This Morning that she’s not in, which raises the distinct possibility that every time shedoesdo duty on the ITV sofa she shoots straight home to watch it back. Thus raising the possibility that bubbly Alison Hammond is a sociopath. I think we’ll park that until the new year too.Olivia Colman is fabulously competent at everything. It cannot and should not be any other way. Sophie Winkleman, who played Big Suze, channels her alter ego marvellously. “It was very upright and hard,” she says of the headboard to the bed made as part of her showstopper challenge. “But it has lost its promise.” When the group is told it has just 10 minutes left to complete a mini turkey pie challenge, she looks at the state of her offering. “Fascinating disaster,” she murmurs intensely. Robert Webb is not in the lineup, but this is so very Jez that I do not want to hear talk of anything as prosaic as a scheduling clash. It was undoubtedly a character choice and I applaud it.View image in fullscreenFabulously competent … Olivia Colman and Alison Hammond appearing on The Great Christmas Bake Off.Photograph: Channel 4/Love Productions/Mark Bourdillon/PAThey make the aforementioned mini pies, a cake (“Vanilla paste,” comments Matt on his work in progress. “What AM I up to?”) and a dozen biscuit baubles each. David/Mark decorates them exactly as you would expect David/Mark to decorate a biscuit bauble and there is something very soothing about this. Everyone chats and jokes among themselves and Noel, Alison, Prue and Paul have the sense not to get in the way too much. It’s so nice. A little chance to exhale, God rest ye self a moment and brace yourself before the next fascinating piece of festive disaster comes along.The Great Christmas Bake Off is on Channel 4.Explore more on these topicsPeep ShowTV reviewThe Great British Bake OffTelevisionFood TVreviewsShareReuse this content"

I had no idea anything as creepy as Mansions lurked within their sunny oeuvre. Its sound is ominous, its mood one of stoned paranoia, its subject rich hippies sequestered in the titular luxury homes, haunted by the sensation that the flower-power dream is going wrong.The weirdest thing about it is its eerie prescience. A year after its release, a group of people not too dissimilar to those depicted in the song found out just how wrong the 60s counterculture could go. The spectre of the Manson murders hangs chillingly over the track, compounded by the fact that, on their eponymous 1966 album, the Mamas and the Papas recorded Strange Young Girls, about precisely the kind of lost souls that Charles Manson would ultimately convince to do the devil’s work. A minor but thoroughly unsettling slice of buried pop history.Alexis PetridisTell us your favourite music albums of 2025Read moreKaty B – Katy on a Mission (2011)There’s a well-known cognitive bias where, after you become aware of something new, you start seeing it everywhere. It’s known as the Baader-Meinhof phenomenon, but from this year, I’ll think of it as theKaty Beffect, after Katy on a Mission became the unexpected soundtrack of my summer. Having spent my teens and early 20s in New Zealand, I’d never heard it before; I first clocked it at Glastonbury, when two friends and I stumbled on Katy B’s set at the Shangri-La stage at 4am. “Stumbled” is the word: I didn’t learn its title until three weeks later, at a house party with the same friends. Handed control of Spotify, they agreed: Katy on a Mission. Two weeks later, I caught it again at Brighton Pride, the womp-womp bursting from the tent.Discovering this pop-dubstep classic has made me feel connected to a moment in British culture I missed, while coming across it in the wild 15 years later has felt like a second wind for my own youth. As much as I loved 2010s pop at the time, I now find much of it too saccharine to readily revisit. Katy on a Mission shares the era’s exuberance but tempers it with foreboding that now seems prescient. Since summer, I’ve had it on high rotation, making up for lost time.Elle HuntRoberto De Simone and Nuova Compagnia di Canto Popolare – La Gatta Cenerentola (1976)When Barcelona electro-punk duo Dame Area worked in the tiny club Màgia Roja, a hub for the city’s 2010s experimental scene attended by the likes of Arca and Björk, nights often closed with the dark, pounding Secondo Coro Delle Lavandaie. Sounding like an acoustic version of some industrial dance banger, it’s actually a piece from Neapolitan artist Roberto De Simone’s 1976 folk opera La Gatta Cenerentola, in which several washerwomen discuss a sex dream. Dame Area showed me that track years ago, calling it a major influence, and it’s so good I barely gave the rest of the musical a chance. When De Simone died this year, I finally listened to the whole 1976 recording, and kicked myself for not doing so sooner. This eccentric gem celebrates his city’s folklore – based on Giambattista Basile’s 1630s version of Cinderella – and musical traditions, from the Renaissance villanella to the wild folk dance of the tarantella.Alastair ShuttleworthOpal – You Ready (2012)I was at a party when the DJ played an unfamiliar song from a familiar voice, which instantly sent my hips swinging as though I already knew every beat. I scrambled for the Shazam app and found that it was I Said It by Opal, a name I recognised from the lyrics of Mr Vegas’s dancehall classic Hot Fuk: “A Opal, Hottaball and Vegas!” I soon had the song on repeat, in love with its incredible lyrics – “Nookie well tight / It nuh quicksand” – then discovered it was from a six-track EP from 2012, You Ready. That record served me the track Physically Fit, set to the English nursery rhyme One, Two, Buckle My Shoe, which has become the soundtrack to my lifting sessions in the gym.What amazed me is how singularly inventive, playful and sexy this tight EP is and how little known it seems to be despite Opal’s voice being familiar to anyone who knows anything about dancehall; you can’t even find the lyrics or much reference to these songs online. It was released on the label Zojak, also home to Vybz Kartel’s global hits Fever and Summertime: I’ll be trawling through its catalogue for more vulgar, frisky, addictive hits.Jason OkundayeUlver – The Norwegian National Opera (2011)View image in fullscreenImmersive … Kristoffer Rygg sings with Ulver at the Fekete Zaj festival in Hungary in 2011.Photograph: Balázs Mohai/EPA/ShutterstockUlver are the kind of fearless creatives more people should idolise. They started as part of Norway’s black metal scene before escaping not just the borders of that genre, but plenty more as well. Between albums, soundtracks and EPs, they’ve put out more than a dozen studio recordings, and they’ve run the gamut from contemporary classical to post-rock and synth-pop. All of it’s great. So, I was borderline giddy after I stepped into a secondhand shop and stumbled on a tattered copy of this CD/DVD of the band performing at their country’s opera house that I’d never heard of. When I put it on, I discovered that it wasn’t just some oddity, but Ulver in excelsis. It brought their avant garde spirit to new dimensions, using enigmatic video projections as well as interpretive performances from British artist Ian Johnstone. Whether the band were exploring the vaudevillian verve of In the Red or the spoken word of Plates 16–17, it all felt immersive and mystifying.Matt MillsBob DylanThe stats don’t lie: my most-played artist this year is one Bobby Zimmerman, spurred bymy slightly embarrassing Damascene conversionat the hands ofA Complete Unknownin January. (In second? America’s next great bard,Addison Rae.) It stuck: on a long drive, Blonde on Blonde or Blood on the Tracks will inevitably find their ways on to the stereo.Last month, I went to see him live for the first time, figuring that his advanced 84 years might limit future chances. I’d heard so much about Dylan’s contemporary shows being formless dirges in which you might, four minutes into a song, suddenly get a recognisable snippet of It Ain’t Me Babe – albeit potentially in the style of Irving Berlin’s Puttin’ on the Ritz, asa perplexed Bon Iver told me he got at a show in Wisconsinearlier this year. I was prepared for that to be the whole night, and to enjoy the latter-day Dylan experience for what it was: who am I to argue, showing my face this late in the day?But that night in Leeds, he played pristine versions of It’s All Over Now, Baby Blue and Desolation Row. Witnessing such classic 60-year-old songs feels like the gig equivalent of looking at the Mona Lisa or The Scream – getting to share these unbelievable moments of kismet with timeless, foundational art. (Equally captivating was watching this stubborn legend, who largely performed with his back turned, do human things like scrunch his hair and scratch his nose.) Maybe my favourite bit, though, was the spooked, still rendition of Key West (Philosopher Pirate) from 2020’s Rough and Rowdy Ways. I wish that alone had lasted an hour. Never mind the best old music I discovered in 2025: I sense this is a process that will see me through at least the next decade.Laura SnapesLa Bionda – One for You, One for Me (1978)View image in fullscreenExtremely stupid, extremely catchy … La Bionda in Italy, 1980.Photograph: Mondadori Portfolio/Archivio Marco Piraccini/Marco Piraccini/Mondadori/GettyI saw Brady Corbet’sThe Brutalistfour times in 2025. It’s a masterpiece, as is composer Daniel Blumberg’s Oscar-winning score – a sublime kaleidoscope of noise lurching between grandiosity and slipperiness. I listened to it a lot this year, but not as much as I listened to One for You, One for Me by Italian disco duo La Bionda, which plays over the credits.Extremely stupid but extremely catchy, with the squelchiest synth I’ve ever heard, it slaps in the simplest way a song can slap. Every time I left the cinema I was compelled to listen to it over and over, an addictive rush rendering critical thought impossible. The film ends with its complex narrative knowingly forced into a neat conclusion, wryly reflected in its switch from Blumberg’s tricksy score to novelty pop. Perhaps my smooth-brain response was conceptually engineered as part of this tone shift, but I can’t be mad when the song is this good.Claire BiddlesBadly Drawn Boy – Once Around the Block (2000)It’s no secret that I’m drawn to slightly naff provincial guitar music from the early 2000s (I’ve written glowing reviews of Keane and Hard-Fi at recent editions of Glastonbury), but this year I surprised myself by becoming totally enamoured with Once Around the Block byBadly Drawn Boyafter hearing it played in a park in Serbia. Many will associate the track with singer-songwriter landfill, or the About a Boy soundtrack, which BDB composed and performed, but as someone who missed it the first time round, I find it extremely charming: the jaunty but melancholy melody, Damon Gough’s pained cadence, the airy backing vocals. It’s so twee and understated, you could imagine it being sung by the Marine Girls or some Sarah Records band, if you ignored the very real connotations of flannel shirts, beanies and open mic nights. I’m not bothered about the rest of Badly Drawn Boy’s music, but this song has had me in a chokehold.Safi BugelLabi Siffre – Crying Laughing Loving Lying (1972)Despite not having a functioning record player for about two decades, my dad still has boxes of LPs gathering dust in his attic. Earlier this year while I was helping him make space so the ceilings wouldn’t cave in, I came across Labi Siffre’s 1972 album Crying Laughing Loving Lying and, intrigued by the live-laugh-love–style title, decided to take it home with me.Siffre had always been a name I associated with the mighty civil rights anthem (Something Inside) So Strong and had otherwise dismissed as some kind of one-hit wonder. Listening to Crying Laughing Loving Lying, I realised how embarrassingly wrong I was. Armed with an acoustic guitar and his yearning falsetto, Siffre’s 40-minute record led me through the emotions of its title, from crying to the sweet entreaties of My Song, to laughing at the coy lyrical twist of the title track, loving the rollicking rhythm on Cannock Chase – and lying since that I had always known about his masterful songwriting skill. It’s a record that has been on repeat for the rest of the year and has cemented Siffre as a national treasure in my mind.Ammar KaliaOppenheimer Analysis – Don’t Be Seen With Me (1982)It’s rare that a cover version outstrips the original song, and even rarer that the cover and original are equally good. But the latter happened this year when cosmic techno producer Avalon Emerson did her superb version of Don’t Be Seen With Me by early 80s synthpop duo Oppenheimer Analysis. Using plenty of echo on her vocals alongside propulsive drum programming, her take is psychedelic and relentless, like the lights of a tunnel seen through a passenger window. I could scarcely believe the original, which I’d never heard before, would be a match for it.But it is, while being thoroughly different. It shares the same vocal melody and synth motif, but a heavy, bone-dry snare tolls like a portent throughout, and the production’s stiffer, more uptight bearing is a better match for the lyrics. It’s the tale of a person who, on realising that determinedly keeping people at arm’s length is no way to live, feels their old self disintegrate at the arrival of a charismatic newcomer. “Fresh from the cradle, you’re a passion lethal / Innocent smiles don’t mask the evil to a fool like me.” Is this person trying to exploit our narrator? Or is it all paranoid self-loathing from someone terrified of love and society? It’s a great bit of dancefloor storytelling, whatever form it takes.BBTDua Lipa – Be the One (2017) / The Ting Tings – Be the One (2008)When I recently joined my 11th band, they gave me a list of 32 original songs to practise plus a few well-known covers they throw in at smaller gigs. On the list was Be the One … which I took to mean Dua Lipa’s hit from 2017. Playing along with it gave me an epiphany. This glorious electro-pop banger had somehow passed me by, although I wasn’t sure how it would transpose to my band’s indie-folk-pop setup. “WhatDua Lipasong?” they asked me, looking rather befuddled, at rehearsals. It turned out that they’d wanted me to learn the Ting Tings’ Be the One, a 2008 indie-pop hit which had also passed me by but which I’ve now discovered is a little gem. So far, it’s going down really well at gigs, but if the world ever cries out for an acoustic/guitar indie-folk-pop reinvention of Dua’s electro-pop colossus, I’m ready.Dave SimpsonDido – Life for Rent (2003)View image in fullscreenBeyond balladry … Dido performs at the Live 8 concert in 2005.Photograph: Dan Chung/The GuardianEveryone knowsDido. It’s not quite fair to say I “discovered” Dido this year. In fact, the first time I heard White Flag, I was roughly five years old and it happened, memorably, as I was tasting Heinz’s new green and purple ketchup. But I listened to her second album on a whim this year after listening to the new Snuggle album and marvelled at what a good Dido approximation their song Woman Lake is. As it turns out, Woman Lake only has the light perfume of Dido. The woman herself contains much more than featherweight power ballads: there’s the harried Balearic grooves of Sand in My Shoes; Mary’s in India, a song about – I believe – stealing your best friend’s man while she’s on holiday; and Paris, a dejected and atonal ballad that’s not too far removed from PJ Harvey at her starkest. I was mainlining Life for Rent for a few weeks, but I had to stop – a friend told me I was beginning to romanticise everyday life too much.Shaad D’SouzaExplore more on these topicsCultureBest music of 2025Pop and rockMetalDubstepKaty BOperaBob DylanfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Photograph: Marizilda Cruppe/The GuardianFrom the Indigenous doctor balancing traditional and western medicine to a father risking death to provide for his family in Gaza, these are some of the people whose determination and bravery stood outByGuardian reportersSupported byAbout this contentThu 25 Dec 2025 00.00 ESTShareThe Indigenous doctor uniting western and traditional medicine in BrazilIn 2012, Adana Omágua Kambeba travelled 4,000km (2,500 miles) from her home in Manaus, in the Brazilian Amazon, to take up a coveted place to study medicine at the Federal University of Minas Geraisin south-east Brazil. She becamethe first among her people, the Kambeba, or Omágua, to graduate in the field, still largely dominated by white elites. According to the2022 census, Indigenous people represented 0.1%of those who graduated in medicine in Brazil.Even before receiving her diploma, Adana started fasting, striving to reach her next goal: to become a shaman. Her calling, she believes, is to bridge gaps between western medicine and the many healing traditions ofIndigenous peoples.This message struck me when I first saw Adana, at a conference for innovation in Rio de Janeiro, in 2024. She stood out among hundreds of panellists and sponsors who were talking about business insights, new tech frontiers and standardised buzzwords. Adana, on stage with long feather earrings and rattles made of seeds, gave a powerful talk about the invisibility of Indigenous knowledge, emphasising that scientific research must not usurp Indigenous expertise.View image in fullscreenAdana Kambeba uses the ancestral knowledge of her people alongside conventional medicine in her work. Photograph: Marizilda Cruppe/the GuardianAfter Adana returned to Manaus, we had long video calls and exchanged voice messages over several weeks for her profile. I was struck by how she mediates conflicts that arise when doctors don’t respect the healing traditions of Indigenous people, or when Indigenous patients mistrust treatments prescribed by doctors. As an activist, she campaigns for biomedicine to open up to Indigenous knowledge, and not subjugate it.The path has not been easy. At university, Adana faced prejudice and almost had a breakdown. Then she heard a voice that strengthened her resolve: “Something inside me said, ‘This is your mission. Never doubt it.’”Júlia Dias CarneiroThe exiled Iranian fighting to save her father from death rowFor two years, Zhino Babamiri has lived between two wars: one waged by the Islamic Republic, whichsentenced her father, Rezgar Beigzadeh Babamiri to deathin Iran, the other within herself. During months of sleepless nights, she weighed up whether speaking about her father might be the very thing that would seal his fate.For families like Zhino’s, the terror is not in speaking to western media, but in what follows: retaliation. I have interviewed several families in Iran who learned their loved ones were hanged at dawn; no final goodbyes or last embrace. More than1,400 people have been executedin Iran this year, according to rights groups, crushing dreams and destroying families. The fear is palpable.View image in fullscreenRezgar Beigzadeh Babamiri, a Kurdish political prisoner who was arrested and sentenced to death, with his now-exiled daughter, ZhinoEven during our interview, I sensed the terror in Zhino’s voice, but also the determination to save her father. She made it very clear, that silence hadn’t saved him. Each morning, her heart races as she unlocks her phone, bracing for news she is not ready to receive. And still, she wakes up every day ready to continue the fight – not only for her dad, but for other Iranian fathers on death row.Alongside children of fathers facing the same fate, Zhino, 24, co-founded the Daughters of Justice to campaign against the record number of executions in Iran. She refuses to stand back, launching online campaigns and meeting European politicians in an attempt to save lives.I am only doing what [my father] taught me: resistingWatching her take up this fight in exile, reminds me of the first few days after Mahsa Amini’s death in custody, when I interviewedyoung Iranian women who marched the streets for freedom.She has also had to endure the ongoing trauma of reading about torture and the awful conditions her father has had to deal with.All Zhino wants is her father back home; to sit beside him again and rewatch the US sitcom How I Met Your Mother, like they did when she was younger.When I asked her what keeps her going, she told me: “My father used to say, ‘Berxwedan jiyan e’ – resistance is life. Now, I am only doing what he taught me: resisting.”Deepa ParentThe Ugandan politician who stood up to sexismThe world will be watchingUgandanext month as the country goes to the polls. Will president Yoweri Museveni lose his grip on power after four decades of rule? One thing is certain: it won’t be a woman who unseats the octogenarian incumbent because all eight candidates on the ballot are men. This is not because women didn’t put themselves forward. It is because politics remains a boys’ club and women are not welcome.Yvonne Mpambara had first-hand experience of the barriers women face, when she ran as a presidential candidate for the 2026 election. She was one of just three women who gained enough support to be considered for nomination – none made it on to the final ballot.View image in fullscreenYvonne Mpambara says the presidency is still associated with traditional masculinity, military credentials and strongman politics. Photograph: Courtesy of Yvonne MpambaraAs a young lawyer from a civil society background Mpambara was well aware that her chances of success were slim but she did not anticipate the level of sexist abuse and objectification that she would face. Men either accused her of sleeping with politicians to get to the top, or propositioned her themselves.Mpambara, 33, described the experience as “one of the most disrespectful periods of my life”. Depressingly,her article detailing the harassmentunleashed more abuse. “The misogyny is coming out in full force,” she messaged me shortly after it was published. Men had commented that she should just “learn to take nice compliments”.Yet she refuses to let the abuse derail her. She may not have made the ballot this time but she is fighting back in the most effective way – by setting up a foundation that will nurture future female leaders. She is also in the process of establishing an all-female political party.Mpambara epitomises the notion that gender equality is never a given, it is always fought for. I have no doubt that she is now a role model for many girls and young women who followed her as she offered a new political vision for Uganda, and a future where women are given the same opportunities and respect as men.Isabel ChoatThe Gazan father who risked his life to feed his childrenEach day,Raed Jamal would leave his tent on the coast in south-west Gazaand start walking towards the one place he might have a chance of getting food for his family – what he called “the American aid” centres. He would have to queue with others, walk along a specified route and pass through checkpoints, surrounded at all times by Israeli soldiers and US mercenaries. Often, hewould post TikToksof this journey – and that’s how I first found him.View image in fullscreenA still from one of Raed Jamal’s videos of him lying on the ground while bullets pass overheadI spoke to Jamal soon after he posted a video of himself and friends lying on the ground as bullets whizzed overhead. He told me how he had seen people killed while trying to get aid from theGazaHumanitarian Foundation – a US-run militarised aid system that, at the time, had replaced UN distributions. Despite the danger and the times he returned with empty bags, he kept going, because food in the markets was too expensive and this was the only way he could feed his family.“What else can we do? Our life is a struggle,” he told me.Jamal’s struggle to look after his family has continued since a ceasefire was agreed in October. Aid access is better than before but his concern now is how to protect his family from rains thatflood their tattered tent. With little money and unable to return home, he is constantly searching for ways to keep their tent standing and his family warm.Gaza has fallen out of the headlines but hundreds of thousands of ordinary Palestinians like Raed face a third winter of hunger and homelessness.Kaamil AhmedThe Uyghur woman who took on ChinaFour years ago, Zeynure Hasan was alone with her three young children in Istanbul and facing a seemingly impossible task to reunite her family. Her husband, Idris, was in jail in Morocco at the behest of the Chinese authorities. A victim of their relentless pursuit ofUyghurs– a mostly Muslim ethnic group from the country’s north-western Xinjiang province – who have managed to flee into exile.View image in fullscreenZeynure Hasan says she had never considered herself political or outspoken until her husband was arrested. Photograph: Emre Çaylak/the GuardianZeynure told me she had lived a quiet family lifeand “didn’t have Facebook or these kinds of things”. Yet she knew she had to make as public a stand as possible to rescue her husband. “Everyone knows Uyghurs sent to China will be tortured or die. They [the Chinese government] pushed me to speak out.”At significant risk to her life, she started a personal campaign to raise awareness of Idris’s fate and his imprisonment for helping to promote Uyghur culture and identity. She spoke to journalists, politicians, lawyers and campaigners – all while juggling work as a teacher and a parent.With Morocco under pressure fromChinato deport him, rescuing Idris seemed unlikely. Yet her love and support for him, and her belief that she could save him, never wavered as the months and years passed. The family was finally reunited in September this year after being granted asylum in Canada.Tom LevittThe former gangster running a football academy in South SudanAlaak ‘Kuku’ Akuei remembers the meaningless street battles, drug use and his mother’s tears when she visited him in jail. “It took me three years to exit the group,” the 25-year-old former gangster recalls, “because to leave a gang, there are conditions, you must pay to be free.”I started with seven kids and now we’re 1,000. It makes me believe that I can stop this issue of gang groups with footballNow a football coach andhead of the Young Dream Football Academy, which he founded in Sherikat, an eastern suburb of Juba, South Sudan’s capital, Akuei believes in the power of sport to counter the dramatic rise of youth violence in his country.View image in fullscreenAlaak ‘Kuku’ Akuei, a 24-year-old former gang member who founded the Young Dream Football Academy in Sherikat. Photograph: Florence Miettaux/the GuardianHis mission to offer an alternative to gang life is rooted in his own experience, and what it feels like to have “no support” while at the same time wanting to “be someone”. “Youths want to be famous in their neighbourhood, and they need money. Sometimes they just don’t have enough to eat. Gangs can provide all that,” he says, recalling his own motivations to join a crew in 2013, when, aged 13, he arrived in Juba, without his parents, to stay with an uncle.“My problem is that I didn’t go to school,” he says, apologising that his English is not 100%. “I want to build my career as a leader. Right now, I’m leading a lot of people,” he says. “I started with seven kids and now we’re 1,000. It makes me believe that I can stop this issue of gang groups with football.”What impressed me about Akuei is not just that he escaped from a destructive path, but that he has become a respected figure in the same neighbourhood where he joined gangs. He can now be proud to offer a safe space and a sense of belonging to children who might otherwise think society has let them down.Florence MiettauxThe South African outreach worker forced back to sex work by USAID cutsI met Amandain downtown Johannesburgon a crisp late-autumn day in May. For seven years she had been an outreach worker at a clinic for sex workers run by the reproductive health and HIV institute at the University of the Witwatersrand (Wits RHI), but had been forced to go back to street sex work at the age of 39 when the clinic closed in the wake of USAID cuts.Amanda showed me around the sex work “hotspots” of Johannesburg’s rundown central business district – a car park with shacks where women took their clients, a roadside under a bridge where they could be picked up by clients in cars. She knew everyone by name and it was clear they respected her.View image in fullscreenHIV-positive sex workers Lebo and Amanda, who lost access to treatment when US funding cuts forced a specialist clinic serving sex workers to close. Photograph: Rachel Savage/the GuardianAmanda is HIV positive herself and had to get a client to buy her medication. But she carried herself with confidence and continued to communicate with care for others.With her empathy and savviness, I could tell that Amanda had been an incredible outreach worker. Grassroots community workers are the unsung heroes of healthcare worldwide. It is a shame that it has taken the firing of so many of them for people to recognise their importance.The Wits RHI clinic is scheduled to reopen once an agreement is signed with the ministry of health. But the services will be more limited as they aim to train ministry workers and transfer patients to the government. Amanda has applied for jobs that have been advertised, but not heard back yet.Rachel SavageExplore more on these topicsBrazilIranChinaUgandaSouth SudanUyghursfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Rather, it is part of the reason why Rice is being discussed as one of the best players in the world.“You can’t eff and blind, you can’t bully people,” says Terry Westley, the head of West Ham’s academy when Rice was there. “But we should be able to have a conversation and say: ‘Look, that ain’t quite good enough and we want to help you because this is what we need to do.’Declan Rice cranks up volume to show he is Europe’s best player right now | Nick AmesRead more“Either they walk out your office and go: ‘Fucking bloke, don’t know what he’s talking about. I’m going to tell my dad or my agent.’ Or you walk out the office and go: ‘Right, what do I need to do? Let’s get on with the work.’”It is fairly clear which camp Rice fell into. One Champions League-winning coach recently privately described him as “the best midfielder in the world”, which even when he wasa £105m signing for Arsenaltwo years ago seemed a stretch. To longtime observers, his rise has occurred gradually and then all at once, encapsulated in an astonishingperformance against Real Madridin April when he scored two brilliant goals from free-kicks in a 3-0 win.View image in fullscreenDeclan Rice training at West Ham in August 2018.Photograph: Arfa Griffiths/WHUFC/Getty ImagesIf you consider his backstory of rejection and the need to give that clean feedback, it is barely credible Rice should be discussed in the terms he is today. Chelsea ditched him at 14, which is beginning to bear comparison with Decca Records rejecting the Beatles. But even as a 16-year-old at West Ham coaches were divided over whether to offer Rice a scholarship, the pathway to the first team.By his own admission, Rice had an odd, uncoordinated running style, which is further evidence of his extraordinary development. A Premier League manager describes him as being “like a Rolls-Royce, so graceful in his actions and movements”.Westley recalls the debate over the gangly teenager and whether he would make the cut. “There were people who weren’t as forthright as I was,” he says about the decision over offering a scholarship. “There was no guaranteed pro contract for Declan, but there was no moaning from him. The scholarship came after a game at Fulham when I put him in the under-18 team. I said: ‘You don’t need to be panicking any more. We’re going to give you the scholarship.’“Declan gave a talk for me last year [to young footballers] and he said: ‘I look back now and I think having had clean feedback [back then], I can’t now accept anything else.’ I told him: ‘That’s really powerful.’“He said that we didn’t pussyfoot around. [But] you can’t give many people clean feedback any more. [You’re] tiptoeing around. Agents don’t tell their players clean feedback because they’re scared of losing them. Very rarely do I come across a parent who’s going to tell them the truth. They don’t want to hear it either.”View image in fullscreenDeclan Rice signs a new contract at West Ham with Terry Westley (left) and the manager Slaven Bilic in 2017.Photograph: Arfa Griffiths/WHUFC/Getty ImagesNeither Westley, nor Tony Carr, who rescued Rice from Chelsea at 14 on the recommendation of his scout Dave Hunt, could have predicted this ugly duckling would blossom into quite as elegant a swan.Carr says: “Dave said: ‘We should take a look at this kid Chelsea have released. I think he’s got a bit more to him,’” a line, 12 years on, that reads like one of the more understated and prescient judgments in recent football history.Slaven Bilic, who gave Rice his West Ham debut, is characteristically blunt. “We thought he might one day turn out to be West Ham captain as a centre-back, a John Terry type, because he was reliable and had determination. But let’s not bullshit. Did he look like he would go on to be one of the best midfielders in the Premier League? No, I can’t lie.”Carr brought Rice into West Ham, initially on trial, which meant the teenager had to leave his family home in Kingston, south-west London. He moved into West Ham’s version of Hogwarts, two big Georgian houses joined together in Chadwell Heath, near the old training ground, where academy players live together.His willingness to embrace the change was notable. “He was very bright, very confident,” Carr says. “Although he was probably nervous, he wanted the ball all the time. He listened and he was a very quick learner.”View image in fullscreenDeclan Rice’s set-piece ability has drawn praise from his England teammate, Jordan Pickford.Photograph: Alex Pantling/FA/Getty ImagesThe quick-learning component to Rice has been evident in embracing his set- piece role, which puts him at the heart of the latest tactical trend in football and makes him even more important forArsenaland England.“He has got one of the most powerful whips I have ever seen,” said his England teammate Jordan Pickford. As Rice has said, it is a skill he may have overlooked were it not for Mikel Arteta andArsenal’s set-piece coach, Nicolas Jover, encouraging him to embrace it during a midwinter trip to Dubai in 2024.Then there is the switch from the cautious, defensive No 6 to the marauding No 8. The criticism midfield greats such as Graeme Souness and Roy Keane made about him at the time of his £105m move – that he didn’t score enough goals – is said to have registered with him.Just as when Chelsea rejected him, confidants say he did not brood on it, but looked for ways to improve that part of his game.View image in fullscreenDeclan Rice has progressed from rejection by Chelsea to being a vital part of Thomas Tuchel’s World Cup hopes with England.Photograph: Alex Pantling/FA/Getty Images“I’ve done some work on champions in different sports and [the common thread is] that when you give someone information, they’re hungry for it, they’re thirsty for more,” says Westley. “They thrive on wanting to do something different; they don’t sneer. He falls in that bracket. ‘What can I learn now? What do I need to do? How can I do that?’ He was like that when he left Chelsea and joined us.”‘His impact is huge’: Arteta hails Rice’s attacking evolution before Chelsea testRead moreIt has been intriguing to see Rice, who will be 27 on 14 January, embrace his superstar status this season. Arteta calls him a “lighthouse” on the pitch, apt not just because of his height but also because of his ability to lead throughrocky moments of the season.Off the pitch, he has attended London’s Fashion Awards and doubtless had fresh bouts of clean feedback from teammates when discussing his favourite moisturisers, fragrance and the eye patches he uses as part of his grooming regime. Observers say that even while he was at West Ham there was a hint of Bobby Moore about him.“He was always slick, looking sharp,” says one West Ham staffer. The Nanushka leather jacket and Savile Row-styled trousers he wore in a recent photoshoot were very much in the vein of England’s World Cup-winning captain.View image in fullscreenDeclan Rice at the Fashion Awards at the Royal Albert Hall in December 2025.Photograph: WWD/Getty ImagesEmulating Moore’s 1966 heroics is the task Rice will embark on next year, as well as getting Arsenal over the line in the Premier League and going beyond last year’s Champions League semi-final.“He will certainly be central to all of those teams and performances, so then would be a Ballon d’Or contender. I’m seeing he’s been mentioned in that class in the media,” says Westley, who is old and wise enough to add: “That’s a lot of ifs. A lot needs to drop to the right side for him to win that.”A Premier League manager backs that assessment. “He would certainly be in a group of the best in the world at the moment, but to be named the best he would have to be winning things for Arsenal.”The only component missing from Rice’s status is major trophies. Doubtless some clean feedback on that gap in his CV will help focus the mind for 2026.Explore more on these topicsArsenalWest Ham UnitedfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Then I found my parents and step-parents in bed togetherIt was our first joint family Christmas, and I watched fearfully as my mum walked into the kitchen she had once called hers. The next 48 hours were full of surprisesClare FinneyThu 25 Dec 2025 00.00 ESTShareThere are still moments I pinch myself: when, over the remnants of turkey and red wine, my divorced parents regale us all with an in-joke from their previous life. When, on the pre-lunch walk, my dad and stepdad stroll in lockstep and talk about finance and even feelings, occasionally. When we’ve all exchanged gifts, and the most thoughtful gifts are not between husband and wife or parent and child, but ones the divorced and remarried couples have given each other.We’ve been doing this for 25 years now, this joint familyChristmas, complete with step-parents, parents and siblings. But every so often, I remember how weird it all once felt. The first time, when I was 11 years old, I watched fearfully as, on Christmas Eve, my mum walked into the kitchen she once called hers. Despite her initial efforts to pretend otherwise, it was clear she still knew where everything lived – and that the next 48 hours would be easier if she admitted it.To her credit, my ever-pragmatic stepmother didn’t mind. Indeed, she relished not having to point out the location of every last fork and bowl; both mothers favoured efficiency above standing on ceremony. Together, they peeled and chopped parsnips and potatoes, and I looked on, hardly daring to trust their felicity.And yet it held. When I wandered, bleary-eyed, into the room that was once my parents’, and now my dad and stepmum’s, on Christmas morning, I found all four of them, parents and step-parents, in bed together, merrily chatting. Squeezed in tight, clad in their dressing gowns, they resembled the Bucket family in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. If anyone was uncomfortable – physically or emotionally – they did not show it. My younger brothers were already there, waiting impatiently with their stockings, which all four of the parents had filled, with very little prior consultation as to who was giving what.As paper and Sellotape flew, our parents and step-parents swooped to seize the gifts that were in the wrong place at the wrong time, or with the wrong person. Such scenes will not be unique to our family, I am sure – but the addition of flapping dressing gowns on spouses old and new made for a surreal pantomime, and I breathed a sigh of relief when I reached the cool, waxy clementine that signalled the end of my stocking.I remember my child’s antennae quivering nervously at the time, wondering how this unconventional Christmas would pan out, but I never encountered the uneasiness or tension I had expected. The adults behaved – well – like adults, who had kids to care for and create Christmas for, and who could be in control of their feelings. There were more mad moments, of course – like when my mum and stepmum discussed my dad’s snoring at length on Boxing Day, or when my mum issued tips on how to make the niche grapefruit and pine nut salad my dad has loved since childhood. But these “weird” exchanges have become my normality and, over time, added to the devil-may-care camaraderie of the festive occasion.I got married this year, surrounded by family and friends. But when I came to say my thank yous, I thought back to our “weird” Christmas. I thought about divorce – on my wedding day, it’s true – and all that my parents and step-parents had achieved, for themselves and for us; how the care and kindness they showed each other at this and every other time of year has taught me so much about love.Next year, my husband and my brother’s new wife will join us for Christmas – and while they’re used to our unusual dynamic, I’m looking forward to adding them to the festive cocktail. It will be good to shake things up, and remind ourselves that Christmas is never fixed; that while old traditions are sacrosanct, new people can make them better.Explore more on these topicsChristmasMy weirdest ChristmasFamilyParents and parentingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The Department of War executed numerous perfect strikes, as only the United States is capable of doing.”The US military’s Africa Command said the strike was carried out in Sokoto state in coordination with the Nigerian authorities. An earlier statement posted by the command on X said the strike had been conducted at the request of Nigerian authorities, but that statement was later removed. Pentagon chief Pete Hegseth said he was “grateful for Nigerian government support + cooperation”.Nigeria’s foreign ministry said the strikes were carried out as part of ongoing security cooperation with the US, involving intelligence sharing and strategic coordination to target militant groups. “This has led to precision hits on terrorist targets in Nigeria by air strikes in the North West,” the ministry said in a post on X.Trump has previously said he would launch a “guns-a-blazing” US military intervention in Nigeria, claiming that the country’s government hasbeen inadequate in its efforts to prevent attacks on Christiansby Islamist groups.Nigeria is officially a secular country but its population is almost evenly divided between Muslims (53%) and Christians (45%). Violence against Christians has drawn significant international attention, especially among the religious right in America, and it has often been framed as religious persecution.However, Nigeria’s government rejects framing the country’s violence in terms of religious persecution, saying in the past that armed groups target both Muslims and Christians, and US claims that Christians face persecution do not represent a complex security situation and ignore efforts to safeguard religious freedom. But the government has previously agreed to work with the US to bolster its forces against militant groups.Many analystssay the situation is complex and has long roots in the region’s history. In some parts of the country, clashes between itinerant Muslim herders and predominantly Christian farming communities are rooted in competition over land and water.Priests and pastors haveincreasingly been kidnapped for ransom, but some experts say this may be a trend driven by criminal incentives rather than religious discrimination.Trump, who positioned himself as the “candidate of peace” in 2024, campaigned on the promise of extraditing the US from decades of “endless wars”. However his first year back in the White House has been notable for the number of military interventions overseas, with strikes on Yemen, Iran, Syria and others, as well as ahuge military buildupin the Caribbean targeting Venezuela.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationNigeriaDonald TrumpIslamic StateAfricaUS foreign policyUS militarynewsShareReuse this content"

Since its introduction, neither the uptake nor the length of paternal leave taken has increased, said researchers. The last Conservative government’s 2023evaluation of SPLfound that only 1% of eligible mothers and 5% of eligible fathers used it.Chart showing statutory shared parental payA growing body of evidence also suggests that shared parental leave has become the preserve of higher earners concentrated in the south-east of England. Analysis of HMRC data by campaign group the Dad Shift, reveals that 95% of shared parental leave in 2024-25 was claimed byfathers in the UK’s top half of earners, those making more than the average salary of £37,800 a year.HMRC datareveals a consistent decline in the share of SPL going to the bottom 50% of earners almost every year since it was created. While around one in 10 claims for shared parental leave were made by average- or low-paid dads in 2015, the figure is now closer to one in 20.Chart shows share of payments going to the bottom half of earners is in decline“A lost decade on, it’s clear shared parental leave is good for a handful of wealthier families in the south-east but just doesn’t work for most working fathers and non-birthing parents,” said George Gabriel, co-founder of the Dad Shift.“In the past decade, who gets time with their new babies has become a clear class issue, with normal blokes priced out of those early weeks and months with their babies, despite a mountain of evidence showing that proper paternity leave is not just good for dads, but mums and babies too.”Wanna hear the one about the low-paid dad who took paternity leave?Read moreThe government’slaunch of an 18-month reviewof the UK’s parental leave system in July was hailed as a “watershed moment” by the House of Commons women and equalities select committee, but MPs warned that “tinkering around the edges of a broken system will let down working parents”.The minister for employment rights, Kate Dearden, acknowledged the current “parental leave system needs improving” and pointed to the review and to measures in the workers’ rights bill that will make paternity leave a day-one right. “No parent should feel they cannot spend meaningful time with their children, and supporting them to do so is essential,” she said.Swinson said a key problem with the current policy was the requirement for women to “give up” some of their maternity leave, and a lack of ringfenced time for dads to spend with their children, and urged the government to implement “take it or leave it” time off work for dads.“The government has to be bold,” she said. “Let’s not have an incremental tweak. Let’s recognise that this hasn’t moved for 10 years – we need a leap at this point.”Baroness JoJo Penn, who worked with Theresa May on the introduction of the policy from 2010, and sought anamendment to Labour’s flagship workers’ rights billto increase statutory paternity leave from two to six weeks at 90% of a father’s salary, said: “Ten years on, it’s clear shared parental leave is not delivering on its original aims. Around half a million new parents every year shouldn’t have to wait to be able to have both parents access proper leave when they have a baby.”“The case for change is overwhelming, and at the moment I worry that the government has another year for its review but we won’t get any real change at the end of it,” she said.Explore more on these topicsMaternity & paternity rightsParents and parentingFamilyJo SwinsonEmployee benefitsnewsShareReuse this content"

The missing men are aged in their 40s and 60s.Det Supt Hayley Costar, of Devon and Cornwall Police, said: “As dark falls, a number of these searches have been stood down, with some police enquiries on land continuing this evening.“There have been weather warnings in place this week and a number of official and unofficial swims have already been cancelled.“While there are no official warnings in place for tomorrow, we urge anyone with plans to go swimming in the sea on Boxing Day not to.”In a statement, the Coastguard said its search was stood down at 5pm.A spokesperson said: “Alerted at around 10am, Exmouth and Beer coastguard rescue teams, RNLI lifeboats from Exmouth, Teignmouth and Torbay, coastguard search and rescue helicopters and fixed wing aircraft were sent to the scene to assist, alongside police and ambulance service.“Searches have continued throughout the day to find two men believed to still be in the water. After extensive shoreline and offshore searches, the coastguard part of the search was stood down at 5pm.”A number of Christmas and Boxing Day swims in Devon and Cornwall were cancelled this year because of a yellow weather warning for wind.The Met Office warned of “strong and gusty east to northeasterly winds” from 4am until 11.59pm on Christmas Day in parts of the south-west of England and Wales.It said peak gusts would reach 45 to 55mph but these could reach 55 to 65mph along some exposed coasts and to the west of prominent hills.Disruption could be caused to transport and power supplies, the forecaster said.It added: “Large waves will be an additional hazard on some coasts.”Anyone with information which may assist in the search for the swimmers should contact Devon and Cornwall police by calling 101 or through the force’s website, quoting log number 191 of 25 December.Explore more on these topicsUK newsDevonnewsShareReuse this content"

But the courage and sacrifice of our servicemen and women, and the way communities came together in the face of such great challenge, carry a timeless message for us all.Princesses Eugenie and Beatrice join royal family for Christmas Day serviceRead more“These are the values which have shaped our country and the Commonwealth. As we hear of division, both at home and abroad, they are the values of which we must never lose sight.”In the wake of the Bondi beach shooting and the Manchester synagogue attack, Charles also praised the “spontaneous bravery” of those who put themselves in “harm’s way to defend others”.The king referenced the impact new technologies can have on wellbeing and community cohesion as the world spins “ever faster”, suggesting the festive period might be a moment to recharge and for those communities to grow stronger.The annual broadcast is written by the king and is the rare occasion when he does not consult government.King Charles is said to see his role as helping to build bridges between communities, faith groups and others – seeking to portray himself a part of society, not apart from it.He praised the qualities of “resilience in the face of adversity; peace through forgiveness; simply getting to know our neighbours and, by showing respect to one another, creating new friendships”.He added: “Indeed, as our world seems to spin ever faster, our journeying may pause, to quieten our minds – in TS Eliot’s words ‘at the still point of the turning world’ – and allow our souls to renew.“In this, with the great diversity of our communities, we can find the strength to ensure that right triumphs over wrong,” he said, adding that people “need to cherish the values of compassion and reconciliation”.The broadcast showed Charles at Heaton Park synagogue in Manchester, where he visited survivors of the October terror attack and met those who blocked the doors as a knife-wielding assailant tried to get in.An arch in Sydney, in Australia, with the words Bondi beach was seen in footage followed by hundreds of floral tributes left after two gunmen targeted a Jewish festival, killing 15 people.The widely acclaimed hero of the massacre, the Syrian-born immigrant Ahmed al-Ahmed, was shot after wrestling a firearm from one of the gunmen.View image in fullscreenThe king visiting the Heaton Park synagogue in Manchester after the October terror attack.Photograph: Christopher Furlong/Getty ImagesAn aide to the king said: “I think his majesty hopes that, if nothing else, Christmas might afford a moment when people could experiment with something of a digital detox to focus more on our friendships, our families and our faith for those who practise.“In this way, the king hopes our minds may find greater peace, our souls can renew, and our communities grow stronger.”The fall of Prince Andrew – a timelineRead moreThe address, recorded on 11 December in Westminster Abbey’s Lady Chapel, made no reference to Charles’s recent “good news” announcement about reducing his cancer treatment, reflecting his wish for his message to mirror society’s experiences during the past 12 months.There was a strong religious element in the address to the nation and Commonwealth from the king; of which the key theme was pilgrimage, and he emphasised the biblical journeys made by Mary and Joseph, arriving “homeless” in Bethlehem, and the three wise men and shepherds to pay homage to the baby Jesus.The king said: “Journeying is a constant theme of the Christmas story. The holy family made a journey to Bethlehem and arrived homeless without proper shelter.“The wise men made a pilgrimage from the east to worship at the cradle of Christ; and the shepherds journeyed from field to town in search of Jesus, the saviour of the world. In each case, they journeyed with others, and relied on the companionship and kindness of others. Through physical and mental challenge, they found an inner strength.”Explore more on these topicsKing Charles IIIMonarchyChristmasTelevisionChristianityCommunitiesnewsShareReuse this content"

Those activists were convicted earlier this month and handed sentences ranging from 16 to 22 years in prison.Udaltsov has rejected the charges against him as fabricated. On Thursday, he denounced the verdict as “shameful” and said he was going on a hunger strike, Mediazona reported.According to the court ruling, the activist will be serving his sentence in a maximum security penal colony.Udaltsov was a prominent opposition figure during the 2011-12 mass protests in Russia, triggered by reports of widespread rigging of a parliamentary election. In February 2012, he took part in a meeting that then president Dmitry Medvedev held with various opposition figures.Russian authorities have ramped up their crackdown on dissent and free speech after the Kremlin sent troops into Ukraine, relentlessly targeting rights groups, independent media, members of civil society organizations, LGBTQ+ activists and some religious groups. Hundreds of people have been jailed and thousands of others have fled the country.In December 2023, a Moscow court sentenced Udaltsov to 40 hours of compulsory labor for violating procedures relating to organizing a rally after he was detained on Red Square, where he tried to unfurl a flag with the image of Soviet dictator Josef Stalin, according to Russia’s state news agency Tass.Udaltsov was previously imprisoned in 2014 and sentenced to 4.5 years on charges related to his role in organizing a 2012 demonstration against Putin that turned turbulent. He was released in 2017.Explore more on these topicsRussiaVladimir PutinEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Musktried unsuccessfullyto sue the organisation last year before calling it a “criminal organisation”.Ahmed is one of five Europeanstargeted by the US state departmentin the past week. They have been accused of leading efforts to pressure technology firms to censor or suppress American viewpoints.Rubio accused the five – who also include the former EU commissioner Thierry Breton – of leading “organised efforts to coerce American platforms to censor, demonetise and suppress American viewpoints they oppose”.Sarah Rogers, an official at the state department,posted on X: “Our message is clear: if you spend your career fomenting censorship of American speech, you’re unwelcome on American soil.”The sanctions are beingseen as the latest attack on European regulationsthat target hate speech and misinformation. Campaigners in the UK have warned the British government could be targeted further if the Trump administration steps up its attacks on tech regulation.In a statement, Ahmed said: “My life’s work is to protect children from the dangers of unregulated social media and AI and fight the spread of antisemitism online. That mission has pitted me against big tech executives – and Elon Musk in particular – multiple times.“I am proud to call the United States my home. My wife and daughter are American, and instead of spending Christmas with them, I am fighting to prevent my unlawful deportation from my home country.”Roberta Kaplan, Ahmed’s legal counsel, added: “The state department’s actions here are unjustified and blatantly unconstitutional.“Imran is proud to call the United States his home. Instead of spending Christmas with his wife and child, he has been forced to spend the holiday fighting to prevent his unlawful deportation. It is hard to think of anything more un-American than that.”Ahmed was sanctioned alongside UK-based Clare Melford, who runs the Global Disinformation Index (GDI). Musk has also called for the GDI to be shut down over its criticism of rightwing websites for spreading disinformation.A British government spokesperson said: “While every country has the right to set its own visa rules, we support the laws and institutions which are working to keep the internet free from the most harmful content.”On Thursday evening, a US district judge granted Ahmed a temporary restraining order preventing Rubio and others “from arresting or detaining the plaintiff pending further order of the court”.Ahmed and Kaplan both welcomed the move, with Kaplan saying the order had been granted so quickly “because it is so obvious that Marco Rubio and the other defendants’ actions were blatantly unconstitutional … We look forward to the hearing before the court on Monday.”Explore more on these topicsFreedom of speechTrump administrationElon MuskInternetXUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Though she has not met the former prince, she is one of many survivors calling for accountability for those accused of involvement in the trafficking of women and girls by Epstein.“I think the first thing that needs to be done here is that the UK needs to bring [Mountbatten-Windsor] to justice,” she said.She said the US government should have done a more thorough investigation into Giuffre’s claims about her alleged abuser, who had his titles and honours removed in October this year over his friendship with Epstein, who killed himself in prison in 2019.“A lot of people didn’t believe her. Everybody ignored it and he was quiet, and at this point it’s like, really? This is what it comes down to – she had to pass away and come out with a book.“It’s not OK. It’s disgusting, I’m sorry.“We have many prominent people who are not being brought to justice or just getting swept under the carpet.”The files also show that the FBI sought to question Mountbatten-Windsor about his links to a second millionaire sex offender,Peter Nygard. He refused and no further action was taken.The fall of Prince Andrew – a timelineRead more“He does need to come to America [to be questioned], but I don’t think he will, to be honest with you. It is just the right thing to do,” said Lacerda.The latest release of the documents from the US Department of Justice appeared to expose emails between Epstein’s fixer Maxwell and Mountbatten-Windsor in which the former royal asked her to arrange meetings with “inappropriate friends”.In the emails from 2001 and 2002, a man named “A” talked about being in Balmoral, the royal residence in the Scottish Highlands, and about the loss of his valet. Reports from 2001 record that Mountbatten-Windsor’s valet, Michael Perry, 61, died days before the email was sent. “A” also wrote about his two girls, though did not name Beatrice and Eugenie, and about leaving the “RN” around the same time Mountbatten-Windsor left the Royal Navy.“Have you found me some new inappropriate friends?” the person, A, asked in one email to Maxwell on 16 August 2001.In later emails, Maxwell wrote to an associate asking for girls who were “friendly and discreet and fun” for a man named Andrew who was making a trip to Peru. She said “some 2 legged sight seeing (read intelligent pretty fun and from good families) and he will be very happy”.This coincided with an official trip taken by Mountbatten-Windsor to Peru, to mark the 50th anniversary of his mother Queen Elizabeth II’s reign.Giuffre killed herself in April after years of denials from the former prince ahead of the publication of her memoir Nobody’s Girl: A Memoir of Surviving Abuse and Fighting for Justice.In the memoir, she said she met him in March 2001 when she was 17 and he was 41. She was introduced by Maxwell, who is now serving a 20-year prison sentence for sex trafficking, taken for dinner with the then-prince and with Epstein, and later to a nightclub.“On the way back, Maxwell told me, ‘When we get home, you are to do for him what you do for Jeffrey.’”She wrote: “He was friendly enough, but still entitled – as if he believed having sex with me was his birthright.”Giuffre said she was later given $15,000 by Epstein and was forced to have sex with Mountbatten-Windsor on two more occasions.The former Duke of York has previously said of claimsmade in the book: “I vigorously deny the accusations against me.” He reached a settlement with her in 2022.The Guardian was unable to reach him or a representative about the latest allegations.In the US, you can call or text the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline at 988 or chat at 988lifeline.org.

That is half a million more than last year, according to analysis by the research company GlobalData for Vouchercodes.co.uk.A Chocolate Orange has doubled in price – and got smaller. Why?Read moreHigh streets and other shopping centres are expected to record a 1.5% rise in sales on Boxing Day compared with last year, ahead of the 0.6% pace of shop price inflation, according to the latest British Retail Consortium figures. That is less than half the 3.4% growth expected in online sales, according to GlobalData.Kien Tan at the advisory firm PwC said Boxing Day could benefit from a more lacklustreBlack Fridaysales period this year, during which retailers were disappointed by demand as shoppers held out for better bargains.“There are signs are that Black Friday has peaked in the UK and there will still be people looking for bargains on Boxing Day. It’s not necessarily a comeback but it’s still there – a British institution.”He said the hunt for bargains came as shoppers were feeling more cautious than a year ago as there was “a lot more uncertainty and people are holding back”.Tan said online shopping was on the rise again, driven by busy middle-aged people rather than fashion shoppers. They are likely to be ready to spend more on furniture and other gadgets for the home in the post-Christmas sales as it is now five years since the pandemic fuelled a boom in spending on home improvements, so many goods bought at that time are becoming worn out.Before Christmas, there were signs that shoppers were holding off on purchases. On Christmas Eve, fashion retailers launched early discounts after a mild autumn and winter for much of the country held back sales of knitwear and coats. New Look, Boohoo and Sports Direct all offered discounts of up to 70%, and Next, John Lewis and Topshop offered 50% off.Visitor numbers were down 4.5% on Tuesday compared with 23 December last year, according to the retail footfall measuring firm MRI as a bounceback in cities including London was offset by poor numbers in towns and shopping centres. Footfall recovered some ground on Christmas Eve, up 0.4% on a year earlier.Moji Oshisanya, the chief commercial officer of VoucherCodes.co.uk, said: “The uplift in sales over the Boxing Day sales period is driven by two key factors. We’re seeing a resurgence in appetite for the Boxing Day sales, with shopper numbers forecast to be at their highest level in four years – a healthy 105.2 million [over a week]. The Boxing Day sales are often a moment for consumers to treat themselves post-Christmas, and with finances tight, the deals and discounts available will be used to stretch budgets further.“However, increased participation isn’t the only driver: inflation is also to blame. Over the wider six-week Christmas period, from mid-November to the end of December, sales value is expected to grow by 3.2%, yet sales volume is forecast to fall by 0.3%. This indicates that while people are spending more, driving up overall sales figures, they won’t necessarily be taking home more items.”Boxing Day now vies with 27 December for the busiest shopping day post-Christmas and that will be particularly true this year as the 27th is a Saturday, so many people will be off work.About 44% of consumers say they plan to hit the high streets from Boxing Day onwards, with 29% heading to retail parks and 22% expecting to visit big shopping centres, according to MRI.High street spending has come under pressure in recent years as some big retailers – including most John Lewis outlets, Aldi, Poundland, B&Q, Next and large Marks & Spencer stores, remain closed on Boxing Day.With family structures more diverse, many households also enjoy several celebratory meals in different locations, while public transport shutdowns can hold up trade on the traditional start to the post-Christmas sales.Explore more on these topicsRetail industryChristmasConsumer spendingEconomicsBlack FridaynewsShareReuse this content"

They open up on the joy of working togetherMichael HoganThu 25 Dec 2025 13.45 ESTLast modified on Thu 25 Dec 2025 13.48 ESTShareFor the past 21 years, there has been only one ever-present onStrictly Come Dancing. It’s not dancer-turned-judge Anton du Beke, who usually got knocked out of the contest early. It’s not the panel’s panto villain, Craig Revel Horwood, who might be the longest-serving judge but took sick leave after testing positive for Covid in 2021. It’s not even trusty band leader Dave Arch, who didn’t join until series four.No, Strictly’s sole permanent fixture is Tess Daly. She took a few weeks maternity leave in autumn 2004 after giving birth to eldest daughter Phoebe but since then, the glitterball stalwart hasn’t missed a show, clocking up in excess of 500 episodes. It’s an astonishingly resilient record. Daly has been the linchpin of the ballroom behemoth since the very start. And now that she and co-hostClaudia Winklemanhave stepped down, it is truly the end of a TV era.The pair signed off from live shows with last Saturday’s grand final. Before former footballer Karen Carney and her professional partner Carlos Gu were crowned winners, a surprise video tribute to the departing presenters was played, featuring farewell messages from fans and famous faces including Dame Mary Berry. Revel Horwood read out a heartfelt telegram from “superfan” Queen Camilla, describing the duo as “utterly fab-u-lous” and “perhaps the greatest Strictly partnership of all”.Their send-off concluded with the prerecorded Christmas special, in which goodbyes took a back seat to the festivities. However, both received Christmas gifts from the judges – aptly, a dance for Daly and a comedy skit for Winkleman – before a cathartic last dance where the camera lingered on the duo’s tearful embrace. “It’s our final time,” said Daly. “So let’s make it count. Keep dancing!”With 23 series under her sparkly belt, 56-year-old Daly has been the heartbeat of theBBChoofing contest. Along the way, she has interviewed 324 pro-celebrity pairings and canvassed the opinion of 13 judges. Throughout it all, she’s held the show together and been a reassuringly familiar presence. Viewers might not appreciate how vital she is until she’s gone.Daly has formed two successful double acts. Alongside Bruce Forsyth, she helped establish Strictly as a primetime hit. It’s hard to imagine now it’s a much-loved autumnal fixture but bringing ballroom dancing back to the TV schedules was a considerable punt for the corporation in the early noughties. Daly was a key part of making the show a success.Her father, textile factory worker Vivian, died of emphysema a year before she landed the Strictly job. “My dad loved ballroom dancing,” she has said. “He got me into it when I was a kid. It’s wonderful to think I’ve done something that would have made him so proud.”When Forsyth hung up his dancing shoes a decade later, Daly formed a trailblazing double act with Winkleman – the first ever female presenting duo on Saturday night TV. It’s testament to Daly’s skill that the show didn’t skip a beat during the transition from Brucey to La Winkle. She went from the old stager’s sidekick to the senior partner but made it look effortless, partly thanks to the women’s off-screen bond.View image in fullscreen‘Keeeeeep dancing!’ … Claudia and Tess on the Strictly Come Dancing 2025 final.Photograph: BBC/Guy Levy“We’ve been friends for years, forever texting and teasing each other,” Daly has said. “We’re in and out of each other’s dressing rooms, rifling through each other’s clothes rails. I pinch her Haribo while I’m there.” For years, the screensaver on Daly’s phone was a photo of Winkleman after she’d gone too far with the fake tan. Daly said it made her laugh whenever she looked at it.“Tess had to be a bit of a chameleon,” says Strictly’s longtime executive producer Sarah James. “To be a sidekick to Bruce and hold her own with someone so experienced was incredibly impressive. When he left, Tess and Claudia found their groove really quickly. Their different personalities worked well together and they bounced off each other brilliantly. When you think about duos on telly, there’s Ant and Dec – but they’ve known each other since childhood. To form a duo that fast as adults is extraordinary.”Winkleman pays glowing tribute to how Daly helped her settle in. “I was totally terrified,” she recalls. “I’d get so scared before a show, I’d just cling to her. Tess would tell me she had my back and that was how it worked from day one. She wants everyone to feel comfortable, happy and safe. If one of us was ill, worried about our kids or wearing a dress that didn’t feel totally right, we just looked after each other. She’s my life raft and I really hope I’m hers.”The long-fringed fashionista has served an epic stint herself. Winkleman hosted BBC Two companion series Strictly: It Takes Two for six years before being promoted to the Sunday night results show in 2010, then finally the main live show in 2014. She’s been part of the Strictly family for almost as long as Daly. The pair have stood shoulder pad-to-shoulder pad for 15 years.Winkleman is a brilliant broadcaster – smart, spontaneous, free-wheeling and witty. She’s the one who wins Baftas and lands plum gigs elsewhere. She’s made The Traitors another hot BBC property and is reportedly in advanced talks about her own chatshow. By contrast, Daly’s strengths are often underrated. Beneath the slick facade, she’s full of heart and humour. You don’t helm a flagship live franchise for 21 years without being very good at it indeed.“Strictly is one of the last big live shows still running,” says James. “Sometimes we’re on-air for two-and-a-half hours. So much can go wrong. It can’t be underestimated how difficult Tess’s role is. She keeps it all flowing seamlessly. She ensures the judging panel have their say, while keeping on time. On top of that, she’s so warm and supportive with the celebrities. Being a mum and genuine caring soul, she excels at that. She’s also authoritative with the judges, which is no mean feat.”Escapist entertainment isn’t easy to do. “Tess is the absolute anchor of Strictly,” says Winkleman. “We couldn’t do it without her. My part is easy. I have a bunch of brilliant dancers around me on the balcony. Tess has to command the whole floor below and does it with total charm. She drives the show but never, ever makes it about herself. It’s always about our couples.”View image in fullscreen‘Power couple’ … Craig reads Tess and Claudia a letter from the queen.Photograph: BBC/Guy Levy“What people don’t see on TV is how much goes into contingency planning,” says James. “We practice how to handle it if something goes awry. A lot of that falls to Tess. If a dance goes wrong, or the set or band aren’t ready for the next number to start, it’s generally down to Tess to steer the ship. Thanks to her, viewers wouldn’t be aware that anything has gone wrong. She’s great at responding in the moment. On live TV, anything can happen. Bruno [Tonioli, former judge] might fall off his chair. Someone could swear. You just have to ad lib and keep it moving.” “She constantly saves the day,” adds Winkleman. “She’s extremely calm and a master of live TV. Whatever happens, Tess makes it work. She’s pure magic.”Daly is also a figurehead behind the scenes. “Her investment in the show is the thing that perhaps makes Tess most special,” says James. “She loves and cares about Strictly as much as we all do. I know it’s a cliché but there really is a Strictly family and Tess is the matriarch. She looks after us all, making sure we’re fed, watered and happy. Having had both of her children while working on Strictly, Tess has always been such a champion of working mums, too.”View image in fullscreenTess and Aljaž on the Strictly Come Dancing Christmas Special 2025.Photograph: BBC/Guy LevyThe duo come as a package. Revel Horwood calls them “a power couple”. When they made the shock leaving announcement in October, they did it together on Instagram. They prefer to undertake joint promotional duties, rather than flying solo. Both were recently awarded MBEs for services to broadcasting. With women in the public eye too often pitted against one another by the media, their loyal friendship is a joy to behold. There’s never been a hint of anything but affection between them. This feeds into their on-screen chemistry. “We’ve been through a lot together and I really value our friendship, says Winkleman. “I love her very bones.”Daly gets a rough ride from certain quarters. Venture on to social media during Strictly and alongside catty remarks about the frocks, you might see Daly described as “The Tessbot” or “RoboTess”. Such sniping fails to account for the demands of anchoring a live production with so many moving parts. She’s usually reading the autocue, responding to the voices in her earpiece and reacting to the chaos around her, all at the same time. There’s a whiff of misogyny about much of the criticism. “She’s been at the helm of the longest running entertainment show on the BBC and kept it going for more than 20 years,” says Janes. “Tess deserves a huge amount of credit.”View image in fullscreen‘It’s our final time – let’s make it count…’ Claudia and Tess on the Strictly Come Dancing Christmas Special 2025.Photograph: BBC/Guy LevyCrucially, Daly is happy to laugh at herself. Her most embarrassing moment was “Lactating on live television. Luckily I was wearing black, so only I knew.” Since the leaving announcement, demob-happy Daly has visibly relaxed on-screen. She’s relished goofing around with her castmates and is clearly enjoying her well-deserved victory lap.Winkleman might hit more headlines but Daly is the power behind the sequin-spangled throne. As Strictly strives to recover from a string of scandals, the imminent departure of its long-time anchors signals a period of seismic change. Not only does the BBC need to find the right replacements but there are rumours of production being moved to Manchester. This truly is the end of a choreographic chapter.The pair’s last appearance on-screen will be the pre-recorded Christmas special. The semi-final saw them get a surprise send-off. They shed a tear at tribute videos and were given their own commemorative golden glitterball trophies. It felt right to wave them off early. Self-effacing to a fault, the duo wouldn’t want to steal the spotlight from the finalists.The sight of Tess Daly beneath the Strictly glitterball has been a constant in our living rooms for more than two decades. Expect an emotional end. “We will cry and eat pizza and might have a drink,” says Winkleman. “But mainly we will laugh about how lucky we are to have been part of the amazing Strictly snowglobe. We’re going to miss it so much but will never lose touch. Tess is my friend for life. We both fully support whoever takes over. I can’t wait to applaud from my sofa with a massive bag of crisps.”Explore more on these topicsStrictly Come DancingClaudia WinklemanBBCTelevisionEntertainment TVReality TVfeaturesShareReuse this content"

A glimpse behind the curtain at Trump’s chief of staff, Susie WilesAre her recent candid remarks about Trump an attempt to distance herself from an increasingly unpopular president?David Smithin WashingtonThu 25 Dec 2025 11.18 ESTLast modified on Thu 25 Dec 2025 11.19 ESTShareShe was now one of the family. WhenDonald Trumpaddressed supporters in Mount Pocono, Pennsylvania, in early December,he asked: “Susie Trump – do you know Susie Trump? Sometimes referred to as Susie Wiles.”The US president was referring to his chief of staff, who he said had persuaded him to return to the campaign trail ahead of the 2026 congressional midterm elections. But a week later, Wiles appeared at risk of becoming the family outcast.In a 9,500-wordVanity Fair magazine profilebased on 11 interviews conducted over Trump’s first year back in office, Wiles described the president as having “an alcoholic’s personality” and an eye for vengeance against perceived enemies.Is Susie Wiles an innocent bystander in Trump’s White House? | Sidney BlumenthalRead moreThe first woman to serve as White House chief of staffalso calledthe vice-president, JD Vance, a “conspiracy theorist”, branded tech tycoon Elon Musk an “odd, odd duck” while criticising his dismantling of USAID, and gave juicy opinions on other Trump administration figures.Wiles claimed that she had been selectively quoted for a “hit piece” while Trump, Vance and others rallied to her defence. But the bombshell article raised questionsover Wiles’s motivations, her ideological alignment with Trump and her future as the linchpin of his administration.Chris Whipple, who conducted the interviews, does not believe that they signalled Wiles’s intention to quit. He said: “I don’t think this was part of an exit strategy and I don’t think it was some sort of three- or four-dimensional chess.“It was Susie Wiles saying out loud what she thinks and what she says in private to her colleagues. I don’t think she was taking a shot at JD Vance in order to elevate Marco Rubio or prepare the next step of her career. I just don’t think it’s that complicated.”But some political commentators regard Wiles’s seemingly indiscreet remarks as the rumblings of a conscience and an attempt to rescue her legacy before a departure from the White House that may come to seem inevitable.Rick Wilson, a political strategist and cofounder of the Lincoln Project, an anti-Trump group, said: “I’ve known Susie all my political life. There is 0.000 chance that this incredibly sophisticated and experienced political operative did 11 interviews on tape and did not know exactly what she was doing.“It is beyond ludicrous to say, ‘Oh, well, she was tricked by a wily reporter.’ She’s done several thousand interviews, just like all the rest of us at this level, and she knows exactly what is going on. There’s a grey area here. She did this deliberately. Nobody wants to admit it, but she did it.”Why? Wilson replied: “She is trying to have a plea bargain with history. She’s trying to start laying a predicate that says, ‘Well, I was there and I enabled it, but I got it. I got the joke. I knew what was happening and I’m not one of the bad ones.’Her direct hits on all those people around Trump’s orbit did not go unnoticed by anybody. Everyone got the gag here. I don’t think she’s long for this White House.”The Vanity Fair story was unusual because Wiles, 68, has been careful tocultivate a career as a supporting playeraway from the spotlight. The daughter of American football player and sportscaster Pat Summerall, she worked in the Washington office of New York congressman Jack Kemp in the 1970s then for Ronald Reagan’s campaign and in his White House as a scheduler.View image in fullscreenDonald Trump and Susie Wiles during a meeting with the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, at the White House on 4 February 2025.Photograph: Anna Moneymaker/Getty ImagesShe married Republican advance operativeLanny Wilesand relocated to Ponte Vedra, Florida, where they had two children (they divorced in 2017). After a few years away from politics, Wiles worked for Dan Quayle, the running mate of George HW Bush, and advised two Jacksonville mayors, John Delaney and John Peyton.Peyton, now president ofGate Petroleum Company in Jacksonville, recalled: “She has a great sense of humour, extraordinarily witty, but is very private. She is never going to seek the limelight. She’s not going to want to be the speaker of the local rotary club. Does not want to be interviewed. She does her best work in small groups and she’s kind of shy, actually.”Indeed, having co-chaired Trump’s successful 2024 election campaign with Chris LaCivita, Wiles refused to take the mic during his victory speech. Trump observed: “Susie likes to stay in the background … Look at this, she’s shy; I’ve never seen her be shy before. Susie!”Peyton added: “She’s very effective behind the scenes. She’s been in politics a long time. She knows her job is to let her principal be the star of the show and she’s very disciplined about that.”Wiles went on to work for Florida congresswomanTillie Fowler. She then earned her spurs on statewide campaigns in rough-and-tumble Florida politics and was credited with helping businessman Rick Scott win the governor’s office.After briefly managing Utah governorJon Huntsman’s 2012 presidential campaign, she ran Trump’s 2016 effort in Florida, when his win in the state helped him clinch the White House. Two years later, at Trump’s urging, she helped get underdogRon DeSantiselected as Florida’s governor.But DeSantis soon turned on her, rebuking Wiles in public and traducing her in private; she told Vanity Fair she still does not know what caused the rift. Wiles went on to organise Florida for Trump’s 2020 re-election campaign.She then helped lead Trump’s 2024 primary campaign against DeSantis. Shortly before DeSantis dropped out of the race in January, Wiles made a rare appearance on social media. She responded to a message that DeSantis had cleared his campaign website of upcoming events witha blunt message: “Bye, bye.”Wiles was part of the team that put together a far more professional operation for Trump’s third White House bid, even if the former president routinely smashed through those guardrails.She sought to curb Trump’s worst instincts – not through scolding or sermonising, but by winning his respect and persuading him that he fared better when he heeded her counsel rather than ignore it. Late in the campaign, after Trump delivered a divisive speech in Pennsylvania in which he wandered off-script and mused darkly about the press being shot, Wiles emerged and fixed him with a wordless stare.When Trump then won the election, Wiles was a natural choice as chief of staff despite being widely seen as a moderate Republican rather than a “Make America great again” ideologue in the mould of her deputyStephen Miller. She is now one of the most powerful women in America.Tara Setmayer, a former Republican communications director on Capitol Hill who now heads the Seneca Project, a women-led super political action committee, commented: “Susie Wiles understands the history that she is making, similar to Kellyanne Conway, as women who broke political glass ceilings and who also aren’t hardcore Maga.“They were using their positions and their Maga advocacy for political gain and it worked for them. They reached the pinnacle of their careers. They may have sold their souls to do it but politics is a very ugly business; people do a lot of things to gain power and relevance and financial benefit. Political power is a hell of a drug.”A White House chief of staff is effectively the president’s chief fixer and confidant, charged with delivering the agenda, juggling rival political and policy demands, and acting as a gatekeeper to the Oval Office. It is the latter role that Trump resented during his first term, when he ran through four chiefs of staff, including one who served in an acting capacity for a year.Whipple, who wrote the profile and is the author ofThe Gatekeepers: How the White House Chiefs of Staff Define Every Presidency, commented: “On the one hand, she’s been more successful than any of her predecessors from Trump’s first term.“She certainly has a kind of magic withDonald Trumpand there’s a bond that none of her predecessors enjoyed with the result that she’s run a much tighter ship in the West Wing. The White House functions much more smoothly.“But the big question for Susie Wiles is: has she been able to perform the most important duty of a White House chief, which is to tell the president hard truths? Readers can judge for themselves from the piece, but I think she’s been much less successful at that.”Wiles mounted her own defence in Vanity Fair, insisting: “I’m not an enabler. I’m also not a bitch. I try to be thoughtful about what I even engage in. I guess time will tell whether I’ve been effective.”Her critics argue, however, that she has been unable to say no to Trump and is therefore complicit in his authoritarianexpansion of presidential power, which has included the indiscriminate firing of federal employees, a draconian immigration crackdown and deadly strikes on alleged drug boats in the Caribbean.Michael Steele, a co-host of MS Now’s The Weeknight and former chair of the Republican National Committee, said: “Will she be here this time next year? I’m highly sceptical. Part of the White House chief of staff’s job is to be sensitive and smart about the politics. She’s been able to manage that environment to a degree that has not resulted in her being fired.“But the fallout from that management has been laying waste to the federal government, laying waste to our relationships abroad, and now laying waste to the ideal that the American purpose was to uphold the rule of law in defence of the liberties and freedoms of every person. At the end of the day the roguish nature of this administration is a feature, not a bug.”Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationDonald TrumpRepublicansUS politicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Next spring, we will finally get a museum to celebrate the results: the Museum of Failure is coming to the UK.Its founder, Dr Samuel West, is anticipating a warm welcome: Britain, he said, was the museum’s spiritual home. “I’ve travelled all over the world with the museum but I’ve always wanted to bring it back home because of our black humour and our support of the underdog,” he said. “The Brits totally get it.”TheMuseum of Failure,a travelling exhibition, is dedicated entirely to missteps, flops and aborted ambitions. Its collection spans failed gadgets, ill-fated design experiments, culinary disasters, corporate overreach – showcasing the messy, often hilarious side of innovation.UK-born exhibits include theTitanic, theSinclair C5, theNHS’s national IT programme,Dyson’s Zone,AmstradandThe Body Shop. And, of course,Brexit.Ben Strutt, an innovator who conducts workshops on how to turn failure into strategic wins, has visited the museum and said it could change the conversation about failure by normalising it.View image in fullscreenBrexit is among the UK-born exhibits in the Museum of Failure.Photograph: Guy Bell/Rex/Shutterstock“Visitors will see how some of the biggest, most recognisable brands in the world have failed and how 42% of all startups fail,” he said.“They will also see how things failed in their time but were ultimately successful – like theApple Newtonpaving the way for the iPhone, andGoogle Glassdoing the same for augmented reality wearables – or how better products fail while worse ones succeed, like Betamax and VHS,” he said.But it is not just for scoffing at. West stressed that the museum was not about ridicule but about understanding ambition, risk and the lessons embedded in collapse.He said that despite all the talk about constructive failure in Silicon Valley and “failing forward”, for most people failure remained taboo.“I want to reframe failure and show it is a universal and necessary part of innovation and learning,” he said. “The museum’s message is that we need to take bold meaningful risks to solve the largest problems of our times, environmental, social, economical. If we continue to glorify success and stigmatise failure we will not be able to experiment with and explore the solutions that we need.”View image in fullscreenThe Apple Newton, although seen as a failure, paved the way for the iPhone.Photograph: Goran Heckler/AlamyFiona Murden, a psychologist who has written about failure, said the museum could help people, especially young people, think differently about risk, creativity and resilience.But while glorifying success was a risk, she said, so was celebrating failure: “When failure is framed too positively, like it’s always a cool or enlightening experience, it can unintentionally send the message that failure is easy or without serious consequences. That risks invalidating the frustration, stress and setbacks people genuinely experience, which can be significant, especially in high-stakes or personal contexts.”West agreed that the degree to which failures are or are not tolerated is largely cultural. “A woman came up to me after a talk I gave in Ivory Coast and she was really angry and she was right to be,” he said. “She pointed out that I was approaching failure as a rich, white, privileged western male – that if she failed in her business, her entire family would be plunged into poverty.“It’s the same if you’re a guest worker in Dubai or Qatar on a contract: if you fail, it’s not just a matter of you doing a postmortem workshop to discover what went wrong. No, it’s your livelihood, it’s your family, it’s your visa,” he said.Failure is also understood differently across cultures. In China, visitors came to the museum so they could, they told West, laugh at failed western products. In South Korea, a risk-averse country, visitors were simply confused by what they perceived to be a celebration of failure.In the US, however, the museum was treated as a big joke. “In the US, failure is framed in the narrative of success, and so visitors there found the museum funny,” said West. “They just didn’t get it when I tried to tell them that sometimes failures lead nowhere; they’re painful and there’s no happy ending.”But in Britain, where the venue has yet to be confirmed, he suspects the reception will be more intuitive. “The British sense of humour embraces that sarcastic, dark awareness that things can just go horribly wrong,” he said.Explore more on these topicsMuseumsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s all off to Aunt Joan’s mansion for a beautifully bittersweet festive taleSarah DempsterThu 25 Dec 2025 16.45 ESTShareCan this really be the first Amandaland Christmas special? Surely it’s the third, or 13th. Wasn’t Felicity Kendal in one, tutting? Didn’t David Jason turn up in another with a subplot about plumbing tucked under his arm, and everyone complained about the size of his turducken?It has been around for less than a year, yet the wildly popular Motherland spin-off feels as if it has been with us for ever, so timeless are the characters. But, yes, this is indeed the first Christmas we will be spending chez Amanda (Lucy Punch), grasping show-poodle and self-ordained “Queen of SoHa” (south Harlesden). Or rather, chez Aunt Joan (a sublime turn from Jennifer Saunders), to whose dilapidated rural mansion Amanda journeys in the hope of recreating the “simpler” Christmases of her youth.So it’s all off to Cirencester in neighbour Mal (Samuel Anderson)’s van. (The taxi, naturally, never showed up, thus reminding us of the first commandment of the Christmas comedy special: thou shalt not expect too much from the transportation sector.) Among those chivvied along by the determined-to-be-jolly-at-all-costs Amanda are her eye-rolling children, Georgie (Miley Locke) and Manus (Alexander Shaw); her icy mother, Felicity (Joanna Lumley); and her hapless best friend/dogsbody Anne (Philippa Dunne), whose flight home to Dublin has been cancelled. Anne enters into the festive spirit by blubbing profusely and telling everyone she wishes she was with her family. If Amanda is the selfie-ready #star in this tinselly tableau, Anne represents the donkey. The infant Jesus, meanwhile, is played by a pavlova and swaddled in Tupperware, in accordance with the scriptures. The pavlova – a gift for Aunt Joan – must be kept upright at all times, warns Amanda, lest “the compote breaches the meringue”.View image in fullscreenCrackers … Jennifer Saunders as Aunt Joan and Joanna Lumley as Felicity in the Amandaland Christmas special.Photograph: BBC/PAThe tone – faint desperation larded with a profound sense of unease – thus established, we prepare for an afternoon of merriment at Aunt Joan’s vast manor (“It’s only 11 acres and a ha-ha,” sniffs Felicity). And here she is, a vision of tumbledown eccentricity in padded gilet and bloodied apron (“You’ve caught me mid-giblets!”). Within seconds Joan is manically mustering the troops, distributing canapes and port, her novelty bauble earrings swinging like wrecking balls.Amanda, meanwhile, is determined to recreate a favourite photograph – in which, as a teenager, she squished herself joyously between her aunt and mother – as they all say cheese over a pavlova the size of a pantomime cow. “It’ll be super-cute,” she trills, attempting to shoo everyone into position. Alas, this proves impossible. Everyone is distracted by the fact that the dog has made off with the trout paté.Poor Amanda. Nobody cares about her enormous pavlova. This is the great, bittersweet joy of Amandaland – the vanity always comes with a side order of sadness. Amanda’s snobbishness, her self-delusion and her desperate need to make everything #adorbs has never really been about social standing, Insta-likes or TikTok-whatnots. It’s about filling the unfillable void caused by her mother’s lifelong indifference. In this, Sharon Horgan, Helen Serafinowicz, Barunka O’Shaughnessy, Laurence Rickard and Holly Walsh have created one of the great 21st-century tragedies.To paraphrase Tolstoy (festive!): all happy families are alike; Amanda’s family is mad as a bag of tights. And so, back in Cirencester, Felicity continues to moan about Joan’s frantic positivity, Joan and Amanda continue to pretend that everything is a bed of Cadbury Roses, and Mal finds a secret stash of photographs of a young Felicity doing something unspeakable. (I’m not allowed to say any more about the latter because it’ll apparently spoil everyone’s stollen, but suffice to say it involves a series of very stupid misunderstandings and is very funny indeed.)It’s not a perfect Christmas special: the plot feels a bit thrown together, the climactic homily is underpowered and the soundtrack is so frenetically flute-y that I kept worrying Jethro Tull would spring out from behind the privet hedge and hey-nonny me into the ha-ha.But enough grinching. It’s Christmas, Jennifer Saunders is back on screen with Joanna Lumley and Amanda finally gets to recreate her childhood photo with a pavlova that isn’t really a pavlova at all, we realise, but a beautifully baked metaphor for family forgiveness. God bless us, every one!Amandaland Christmas Special aired on BBC One and is on iPlayer now.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewJoanna LumleyJennifer SaundersreviewsShareReuse this content"

And at present there is no more morbid phenomenon than the crisis of legitimacy for the networks of rules and laws on which the international order was based – the world that the US was central in creating in 1945.No one can say they were not warned about the wrecking ball that was about to be inflicted on the global order byDonald Trump.The US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, spelled out with admirable clarity in his Senate confirmation hearing in February how Trump disowned the world his predecessors had made. “The postwar global order is not just obsolete, it is now a weapon being used against us,” he said. “And all this has led us to a moment in which we must now confront the single greatest risk of geopolitical instability and generational global crisis in the lifetime of anyone alive here today.”The rules-based international order had to be jettisoned, Rubio said, because it had been built on a false assumption that a foreign policy serving core national interests could be replaced by one that served the “liberal world order, that all the nations of earth would become members of the democratic western-led community”, with humankind now destined to abandon national identity and become “one human family and citizens of the world. This was not just a fantasy. We now know it was a dangerous delusion”.View image in fullscreenMarco Rubio at his Senate confirmation hearing.Photograph: Graeme Sloan/EPARubio’s assessment wasechoed in the recent US national security strategy, with its warnings of European cultural erasure and determination to back nationalist parties that believe in “strategic stability with Russia”. The US would no longer seek to “prop up the entire world order like Atlas”, the document said.On paper these sound like relatively coherent statements of “America first”, but in practice Trump’s foreign policy is a mass of confusion in which this formal non-interventionist ideology has clashed with sporadic interventions that uneasily blend notions of global order with the US national interest. There is no linear Trump foreign policy, just a catherine wheel of disconnected explosions thrown out across the night sky. As Donald Trump Jr asserts, as if it were a virtue, his father is the most unpredictable man in politics. The hugely personal nature ofUS foreign policygives Washington’s erstwhile allies just enough false hope that the break with America is not real.Amid this chaos there has been one consistent target for Trump’s contempt: the constraints imposed by international law, and its value system built around national sovereignty, including the prohibition of the use of force to change external borders. In its place Trump pursues “sheer coercive power” – or what has been described as mobster diplomacy, in which shakedowns, blackmail and deal-making are the agents of change.Trump and Putin share a craving for status. That’s why they both want to destroy Europe | Henry Farrell and Sergey RadchenkoRead moreFaced with the choice, for example, between expelling Russia from Ukraine – something the US undoubtedly has the military means to do by arming Kyiv sufficiently – or forging a profitable relationship with Vladimir Putin in which both sides plunder Ukraine’s considerable material resources, Trump unmistakably wants to choose the latter. Ukraine, it emerges, shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, in order to assure the survival and the success of the Trumpian economy. For the EU and Nato this is indeed the moment when every act has the potential to be decisive for the future sovereignty of Europe and the UN charter.Similarly the sovereignty of Venezuela,sitting on 303bn barrels of crude oil– about a fifth of the world’s reserves – becomes, like that of Greenland, Canada and Mexico, the subject of Trump’s marauding eye. Warned on social media that killing Venezuelan civilians without any due process – as the US has done by bombing numerous boats in the Caribbean and Pacific – would be described a war crime, the US vice-president, JD Vance,was brazen enough to reply “I don’t give a shit what you call it”. The Pentagon has subsequently claimed implausibly that it was permissible in US law to blow up shipwrecked sailors stranded in the water because they were combatants representing a threat to US security.Meanwhile, the rules of free trade are shredded as Trump deploys the sheer size of the US market to extort not just money from allies, but changes in their domestic policy. A country’s standing in the White House is not judged by any rational criteria, let alone its democratic status, but on a leader’s personal relationship to Trump and his ruling clique – a blatantly monarchical order.View image in fullscreenQatar’s foreign policy adviser, Majed al-Ansari (left).Photograph: Noushad Thekkayil/EPAFinally, Israel’s occupation and bombardment of Gaza, with European powers often complicit bystanders, is brutal in itself but also strips bare the supposed universality of international norms. In the words of Majed al-Ansari, the foreign policy adviser to Qatar’s prime minister and a man who has had more dealings with Israel than most in 2025: “We are living in an age of disgusting impunity that is taking us back hundreds of years. We are reduced to giving concession after concession not to stop acts of aggression, but to ask those responsible to kill fewer people, destroy fewer neighbourhoods. We do not even ask them to have respect for international law, but ask to take a step back from going 100 miles away from international law.”All this has been accompanied by an open assault on the institutions of international law that stand in the way of coercive power. Nicolas Guillou, a French judge at the international criminal court, recently gave an interview to Le Monde in which he spelled out the impact ofUS sanctions imposed on him in Augustas a result of the ICC’sissuing an arrest warrant against Benjamin Netanyahufor crimes against humanity.The sanctions have changed every aspect of his daily life. Guillou explained: “All my accounts with American companies, such as Amazon, Airbnb, PayPal and others, have been closed. For example, I booked a hotel in France through Expedia, and a few hours later, the company sent me an email cancelling the reservation, citing the sanctions.”For having the temerity to uphold the basics of international humanitarian law and the value of the lives of Palestinian civilians at the international court, which deals with issues such as war crimes and genocide, Guillou said he had in effect been sent back to live in the 1990s. European banks, cowed by the threats of US Treasury officials in Washington, rushed to close his accounts. The compliance departments of European companies, acting as the valets of the US authorities, refused to provide him services.Meanwhile, European institutions – even signatories to the Rome statute that established the international court in 2002 – look the other way. Major Palestinian human rights groups such as Al-Haq also find their bank accounts closed as they face sanctions for cooperating with the ICC. The judges at the international court of justice, the UN body that deals with intergovernmental disputes, have had to take evasive action to prevent their assets being seized.The US has left or sought to undermine several other UN bodies, such as the Human Rights Council and Unesco. In total it is estimated to have cut $1bn (£750m) in funding for organisations linked to the UN and fired 1,000 US government staff whose portfolios reinforced major UN functions.At the UN general assembly, the key site ofthis year’s disputes between the US and the rest of the world, the US almost relishes its isolation. Other multilateral institutions – the World Trade Organization, the Paris climate agreement structure, the G20 – have become zones of conflict, places where the US can assert its dominance or indifference, either by absenting itself or demanding humiliating fealty from its one-time allies. John Kerry, a former US secretary of state, said that under Trump the US was turning “from leader to denier, delayer and divider”.“When the United States walks away, old excuses find new life. China not only enjoys newfound freedom from scrutiny,” Kerry said: it slowly fills the gap left by the US departure.Washington’s turning away from international law and its institutions is especially sad because, as Dr Tor Krever, an assistant professor of international law at the University of Cambridge, points out, with Gaza “the language of legality has become the dominant frame of popular and political discourse”.In a special edition of the London Review of International Law, more than 40 academics have written essays discussing whether this sudden public faith in international law as a harbinger of justice is a load that the law has the capacity to bear. Law cannot be a substitute for politics or settle ideological conflicts in a polarised world. Prof Gerry Simpson, the chair of public international law at the LSE, said he needed to swallow his longstanding doubts about international law’s efficacy “in the face of the enormous faith that had been placed on it, especially by the young”.View image in fullscreenIllustration: Brian StaufferThe inability to meet new public expectations has led to what Prof Thomas Skouteris, the dean of the law college at the University of Khorfakkan, UAE, describes as “afinde sièclemood” about international law. Writing in the Leiden Journal of International Law, he argues: “International law’s lexicon – sovereignty, genocide, aggression – has become almost ambient, saturating the political atmosphere with juridical resonance. But ubiquity brings a strange paradox. The more present international law appears, the less decisive it feels. Norms are invoked with greater frequency and intensity even as their capacity to settle disputes or forestall violence seems to weaken. What once promised order increasingly reads as performance.”The paradox is revealed in its starkest form when rulings of the UN security council or the international courts are invoked by western leaders who, in the next breath, prostrate themselves in front of Trump, caving in to his demands, calling him “daddy”,as Nato’s Mark Rutte did, and sending more lavish gifts to the Sun King and his family.Very few in 2025 stood up against what the Dutch historian Rutger Bregman called “immorality and unseriousness … the two defining traits of our leaders today”.Tom Fletcher, the head of the UN humanitarian agency Ocha, was arguably an exception. In May he asked UN diplomats “to reflect – for a moment – on what action we will tell future generations we each took to stop the 21st-century atrocity to which we bear daily witness in Gaza. It is a question we will hear, sometimes incredulous, sometimes furious – but always there – for the rest of our lives … Maybe some will recall that in a transactional world, we had other priorities. Or maybe we will use those empty words: We did all we could.”View image in fullscreenOman’s foreign minister, Badr bin Hamad Al Busaidi.Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/PAHis was a genuine howl of despair. Another cry of pain came from Oman’s foreign minister, Badr bin Hamad Al Busaidi. Speaking to the Muscat retreat of the Oslo Forum, an international mediators’ discussion group, he explained: “We are worryingly close to a world in which certain kinds of foreign intervention – if not outright invasion and annexation of territory – are accepted as a normal part of international relations, rather than as illegal violations of our shared international order. How did this happen?”Al Busaidi claims the problem predated Trump. “Restraint and respect for international law was abandoned in the aftermath of 9/11, with the launch of not one but two foreign interventions, in Iraq and Afghanistan, ostensibly aimed at the elimination of a terrorist threat, but in reality, functioning as explicit projects of regime change.”Now some on the left welcome the idea that international law’s entry into the limelight has coincided with its loss of credibility. The critics would share the view of the Marxist Perry Anderson, writing in New Left Review, that “on any realistic assessment, international law is neither truthfully international nor genuinely law”.They argue that US presidents – Democrat and Republican alike – have always in reality exempted themselves from the law’s constraints. The US has never been a signatory to the Rome statute or the UN convention on the law of the sea. Roosevelt was not that interested in forging a club of democracies, but wanted as much to create a law-based stability pact with Russia. Indeed, Prof John Dugard, a member of the South African legal team at the international court of justice, has argued that the Biden team’s choice of the phrase “rules-based order” was a revealing code because it showed the US ambiguity towards international law.The Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, has long declared that the US is promoting “a west-centric rules-based order as an alternative to international law”. China’s foreign minister, Wang Yi, made the same criticism in May 2021 during a UN security council debate on multilateralism. “International rules must be based on international law and must be written by all,” he said. “They are not a patent or privilege of a few. They must be applicable to all countries and there should be no room for exceptionalism or double standards.”For much of the global south too, the rules conceal histories of violence and racial hierarchy. Others see international law with its references to proportionality, distinction and necessity as a futile attempt to soften the essential brutality of war.It has been left to an older generation to insist there is something precious worth preserving. Take the response of Christoph Heusgen, the outgoing chair of the Munich Security Conference, in the wake of Vance’s speech attacking European valuesmade in February 2025.Heusgen, who served for 12 years as Angela Merkel’s adviser on security and foreign policy affairs, told the conference: “We have to fear that our common value base is not that common any more … It is clear that our rules-based international order is under pressure. It is my strong belief that this more multipolar world needs to be based on a single set of norms and principles, on the UN charter and the universal declaration of human rights.“This order is easy to disrupt. It’s easy to destroy, but it’s much harder to rebuild. So let us stick to these values.”But Ansari, despondent after a year of often fruitless Middle East diplomacy, predicts we are “moving from a world order to disorder”.“I don’t think we are moving towards a multipolar system. I don’t think we are even moving to a power-based international order. I don’t think we are moving towards any kind of system.“We are moving into a system where anybody can do whatever they like, regardless if they are big or small. As long as you have the ability to wreak havoc, you can do it because no one will hold you accountable.”This article was amended on 25 December 2025. An earlier version misreferred to John Kerry as a former US vice president; this should have said former US secretary of state."

These are women who worked hard all their lives and have all this goodness and light in their hearts – we couldn’t just keep them closed off.”Being the youngest of the nuns, the onus fell on Sister Nayiby, 45, to shine their light beyond the confines of the home.View image in fullscreenThe clips of the nuns have generated thousands of messages online.Photograph: Roberto Salomone/The GuardianSo with the blessing of their mother superior, the women began experimenting with producing videos that recounted their daily lives while offering spiritual guidance.They started simply:the first video, posted on Sister Nayiby’sFacebook accountin July, featured Sister Maria Grazia, 97, imparting a pearl of wisdom about obedience and trust. The clip was an instant hit, generating thousands of views and attracting 7,000 followers to the account – more than double the population of Raiano.View image in fullscreenSister Nayiby Jimenez, left, with the star of the show: Sister Maria Chiara, 98.Photograph: Roberto Salomone/The GuardianOn a roll, the nuns branched out into Instagram, injecting their scripts with humour and music in their savvy quest to target a young audience. Views climbed to the millions and followers now number about 145,000 across their Facebook,InstagramandThreadsaccounts.“All of this has been totally unexpected,” said Nayiby, who was born in Colombia.In one of themost popular videos, the nuns take it in turns to throw a cardboard box out of the window. Each box is labelled with a negative emotion or trait, for example “stress”, “anxiety”, “selfishness” or “indifference”. The clip ends with Sister Maria Chiara saying: “We need to throw out everything that makes us sad, because the Lord wants us to be happy.”View image in fullscreenThe devotees live in a retirement home managed by the Ravasco congregation of Catholic nuns.Photograph: Roberto Salomone/The GuardianIn another, some of the nuns reluctantly take part in amorning exercise routine, before giving up, saying “we’re off to pray”. The overriding message is that care needs to be taken of the body and soul in order for us to “fully bloom”.The clips have generated thousands of messages, and the nuns each have a book listing the names of those who have asked for their prayers. “There are over 200 names in each book, and they respond personally to all,” said Sister Nayiby.View image in fullscreenThe first video gained the nuns more followers online than the number of people in their village.Photograph: Roberto Salomone/The GuardianNeedless to say, the main star of the show is Sister Maria Chiara, hence she is tasked with opening and closing the reels. “I’ve always been a chatterbox,” she said. “But I’m spontaneous, I can never plan anything beforehand.”Sister Anna Lilia, 95, is another spirited participant, although they have not yet risked putting her on a live video: “She has no filter, she just says what she thinks,” said Sister Nayiby.0:24Italian nuns’ social media posts go viralThe nuns come together to script each clip, with each production posted at 5am because “the first thing people do when they wake up in the morning is check their phones”, said Sister Nayiby. However, she confessed to occasionally asking ChatGPT for help with developing ideas.The care home was opened by Sister Maria Grazia Mancini, who was there from Rome during the Guardian’s recent visit. “These women gave so much during their apostolic life and then they reach a point where they feel a little discarded,” she said. “But this initiative has given them the chance to express something beautiful, to have fun and to spread positive messages so that we can resist the evil that sometimes surrounds us.”Explore more on these topicsItalyEuropeReligionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Maggie O’Farrell’s lyrical and immersive novel, which won the Women’s prize in 2020, imagines the relationship between William Shakespeare and his wife, Agnes Hathaway, and their grief over the death of their 11-year-old son, Hamnet, from the plague in 1596. The book opens with the young Hamnet realising his twin sister Judith is unwell and searching for an adult to attend to her, while unaware that he is the one who is fatally ill.Shakespeare – who is never named and instead referred to as “the husband” or “the father” – is depicted not as a literary superstar but a flawed man who is rarely home. The focus is on Hathaway, a free-spirited woman with deep connections to the landscape. The narrative shifts between her childhood, the early years of her marriage and the aftermath of Hamnet’s death, during which Shakespeare writes one of his greatest plays, Hamlet (records state that the names Hamlet and Hamnet were interchangeable in those days).Jessie Buckley, who plays Agnes in the film, is the book’s narrator for this new recording. Her reading is sensitive, almost dreamlike in places, and alive to the hardships endured by Agnes, who is constricted by domesticity, motherhood and her husband’s ambition. But it is in the portrait of death that both O’Farrell and Buckley truly excel. Hamnet is a profoundly humane account of love, loss and a family undone by grief.Available via Tinder Press, 12hr 54minFurther listeningFlashlightSusan Choi, Penguin Audio, 17hr 52minA Korean father’s vanishing while swimming in Japan with his young daughter is the jumping off point for Choi’s sprawling Booker-shortlisted novel, which spans five countries and several decades.

It is a serious subject for me as aCaribbeanman, and I wondered whether the complexity might be flattened or trivialised in the process.I got to read the book this week. InThe Big Payback, Lenny Henry and Marcus Ryder take a complex, controversial and deeply contested subject and do something both rare and necessary: they break it down into its constituent parts and explain – debunking and demystifying along the way – why so many of the stock objections to reparations are intellectually incoherent, historically illiterate or politically evasive.They manage this without sacrificing rigour or warmth, weaving careful analysis with Henry’s trademark humour, a red pea soup recipe and even a short play – reminding the reader that moral seriousness and creative generosity are not mutually exclusive.Slavery was not an unfortunate moral aberration. It was an economic system that catapulted Britain’s rise … but left enduring inequalities in its wakeAs 2025 draws to a close, the book has landed at a moment when the subject of reparations, long treated as a fringe or rhetorical issue in Europe, has caught fire elsewhere. It is difficult to deny that this has been a pivotal year for the global reparations movement – not because any consensus has been reached, but because the question itself has been mobilised.On one side, Caribbean states, African governments and diaspora movements are consolidating claims. On the other, Britain continues to blithely bat the issue away. The gap between the two positions is now the story.In November, the Caricom Reparations Commission, led by Sir Hilary Beckles, visited the UK. The delegation met civil society groups, academics, churches, activists and some parliamentarians. The reception at Westminster was distinctly underwhelming. There were no senior ministers available, no commitment to talks and no indication that reparations would be treated as a live policy question by the British government.It would be easy to read this as a snub – and many in the Caribbean do. But it is important to recognise what the visit achieved: dialogue was opened; reparations were discussed not as an abstract moral plea but as a concrete political claim rooted in law, economics and history. Even limited access helped mobilise the call. Silence, after all, is not the same as stasis.When asked previously about reparations, Keir Starmer made it clear that his government would not be drawn into what he described as “long, endless discussions about reparations on the past”. The prime minister’s phrasing matters. It frames reparations as indulgent and backward-looking rather than as a claim arising from the foundations of the modern British state.View image in fullscreenMarcus Ryder, left, and Lenny Henry’s book, The Big Payback breaks down the subject of reparations with rigour and warmth.Photograph: Ejatu Shaw/The GuardianThis is precisely the framing that The Big Payback examines. Henry and Ryder insist reparations are not about guilt or inherited blame, but about historical responsibility and contemporary advantage.Slaverywas not an unfortunate moral aberration. It was an economic system that financially catapulted Britain’s rise and shaped its institutions but left enduring inequalities in its wake throughout the global south. Inequalities that still exist today manifesting within a broader spectrum of racism. To deny reparations is to deny historical causality.The tired refrain that “no one alive today owned slaves” is beside the point when states, corporations, financial institutions and landed estates persist as legal and economic entities that directly benefited from enslavement. The claim that reparations would be too complex collapses under the weight of historical precedents – from Holocaust reparations to post-colonial compensation schemes – while the fear that reparations would be socially destabilising is exposed as a projection rooted more in political discomfort than empirical evidence.Reparations cannot remain an emotional argument and are not a single cheque, but a long-term process aimed at repairing systems as much as compensating people. At last there are signs of the issue being taken seriously, with some looking at how reparations might work: through investment in education and health, institutional reform, wealth-building mechanisms, cultural repair and apologies backed by material commitments.Reparations are a long-term process aimed at repairing systems as much as compensating peopleThe African Union (AU) declared 2025 to be theYear of Reparations, putting the issue at the centre of its collective agenda for the first time. Leaders, civil society organisations and diaspora movements came together to affirm that this was not a symbolic demand, but a matter of justice, dignity and development.African leaders quickly recognised that one year was not enough. In July 2025, the AU formally endorsed 2026–36 as theDecade of Reparations. This 10-year commitment builds on decades of intellectual and political groundwork – from theAbuja proclamation of 1993, through theDurban declaration and programme of action in 2001, to the Accra declarations of2022and2023.Over the next decade, the AU has committed to mobilising global support, working with civil society and the diaspora, promoting education and research and developing policies around the lasting impacts of slavery, colonialism and exploitation.In this context, Britain’s insistence on “moving forward” begins to look out of step. While Africa and the Caribbean are institutionalising reparations as a development and justice agenda, the former colonial metropoles remain stuck at the level of avoidance. The result is an asymmetry: one side is building frameworks while the other is offering silence.View image in fullscreenFlag bearers at Commonwealth Day celebrations at Westminster Abbey in London on 10 March.Photograph: WPA/Getty ImagesThis asymmetry is reinforced by the hollowing out of the Commonwealth itself. Once imagined as a forum for post-colonial dialogue and shared responsibility, it now struggles to even define post-colonial relations. That the issue of reparations has not secured a place on the Commonwealth agenda speaks volumes about the institution’s limits when confronted with issues that challenge historical power hierarchies.Immigration policy further exposes these contradictions. In recent years, the UK and parts of Europe – taking cues from the hardening of immigration regimes in the US – have allowed increasingly punitive approaches to migration, disproportionately affecting African, Caribbean and Latin American countries.That reparations has not secured a place on the Commonwealth’s agenda speaks volumes about its limits with historical hierarchiesThe rise of far-right politics has helped push immigration policy towards restriction and deterrence, fostering division at home while eroding the moral language of partnership and shared history that once underpinned relations with former colonies.Many African and Caribbean countries continue to face stringent UK visa requirements despite shared histories and Commonwealth ties. This feels like a bitter irony: descendants of enslaved and colonised peoples encounter fortress borders from the very state that once claimed unrestricted access to their lands, labour and resources. Set against the disgraceful unresolved legacy of the Windrush scandal, visa restrictions deepen the sense that Britain’s post-imperial relationship with the Caribbean and Africa is increasingly transactional.No, Robert Jenrick, former colonies do not owe a ‘debt of gratitude’ for Britain’s legacy of brutality and exploitation | Kenneth MohammedRead moreNone of this means reparations are inevitable, or that agreement is imminent. The UK and Europe’s concerns – about fiscal precedent, political backlash and legal exposure – are real and will shape how the debate unfolds. But what 2025 has made clear is that reparations are no longer a marginal or episodic demand. They are being organised, internationalised and normalised as part of a broader reckoning with slavery, colonialism and global inequality.The Caricom visit, the African Union’s Decade of Reparations and the growing alignment between Caribbean, African and diaspora voices all point in the same direction. Reparations or restorative justice, as The Big Payback makes clear, are not about dwelling in the past. They are about deciding what kind of future relationship Britain, as a former colonial power, is willing to create – one built on selective memory and managed silence, or one grounded in truth, repair and a willingness to confront the foundations on which modern Britain still stands.Britain’s leaders say they want to look forward.

I have sacrificed myself on the battlefield ofpatriarchy chicken, by walking square into people who stride down the centre of the pavement staring at their phones and expecting everyone else to jump out of their way. I have risked life and limb in a pub full of football fans by declaring my belief that the only “real sports” are running fast, jumping high and throwing or swimming far – the rest are just “games”. And I have driven myself to tears by consistently walking into the same branch of Pret a Manger and ordering the same coffee, please, “and nothing else”, and then standing there blankly when I’m invariably asked, “And anything else?” When it comes to defending arbitrary red lines, my belligerence knows no bounds.And yet, with Christmas approaching, I have been trembling at the thought of strapping on my armour and fighting yet again for what I truly believe: that meat and fruit should never be served on the same plate. And yes, you perverts, I do mean turkey andcranberry sauce– just stop putting jam on your Christmas dinner!I know what you’re going to say: “But surely you don’t mean pork with apple sauce?” You bet I mean it. Bacon is for a sandwich and stewed apple goes in pie or in babies – they do not belong in the same bite. Oh, you’re thinking, but what aboutduck à l’orange? Put it down you weirdo, you’re not even French. It’s a hard no to lamb and redcurrant, a massive boak at mango chutney on curry, and I sincerely hope that no Guardian reader would think of whispering the obscene phrase “ham and pineapple pizza”.Everyone I meet is sure they can think of an exception to my rule. This week, colleagues have sidled up to me saying, “Coronation chicken?” Step away from me with your squishy raisins! Anything with figs? You’re so wrong. One sick person asked me to consider prosciutto and melon, except that he misspelt it “lemon” at first, so for a minute I actually considered it. Which would have been the thin end of the wedge.Don’t get me wrong, I love meat – ideally with gravy – andthenfruit, for pudding. I’ll adore you for offering me a crunchy green apple, a blackberry crumble, a banana for breakfast or raspberries any which way. Just keep it away from my dinner. Lamb belongs with mint, ham with mustard, and turkey (if you must) with a bucket of coleslaw. A burger, on the other hand, should be served with plenty of ketchup. Because a tomato identifies as a vegetable and should be accommodated as such – and that is a hill I will die on.Katy Guest is a Guardian Opinion deputy editor and astyle guideeditorExplore more on these topicsFoodThe hill I will die onFruitMeatSauces and graviescommentShareReuse this content"

Politicians, voters and journalists have made this claim before – when their side has been out of power for a long while, or when an elected government has been unusually dictatorial – and their warnings have usually been overstated. But this time the evidence of a fundamental shift away from a century-old status quo seems stronger.Familiar landmarks have disappeared:Labourand Tory dominance, two-party electoral contests, the decisive power of a big Westminster majority, the patience voters usually show towards a new government, the predictable pendulum swing between right and left, the red lines between mainstream and extreme politics and even the central role of parliament.Our possible next rulers,Reform UK, barely bother with the Commons, ignoring the convention that that is where future prime ministers make their names. The current government, despite a bland, diligent leader and some decent policies, is despised by most voters with an intensity that may be unprecedented. In the online spaces where political opinions are increasingly formed, debatable facts, rumours, myths, outright fictions and raw emotions surge back and forth, erupt into geysers of outrage – and then subside into stagnant pools of disillusionment.“Confidence in the system of governing Britain remains at a historic low,” the National Centre for Social Researchreported in June. “Trust in governments and MPs … [is] lower now than … after any previous election.” In the New Statesman, in October, the veteran commentator Andrew Marrexpresseda common establishment view: “Britain has become ungovernable.”Because the old party structures and Westminster’s web of institutions and rituals remain, drawing attention to themselves and still shaping the political calendar, it remains possible, some of the time, to believe that British politics is not really changing. There are also many people with a vested interest in prolonging the old order, from MPs who want to enjoy traditional, extended parliamentary careers, to journalists with mainly Tory and Labour contacts. And then there is the unease many voters may feel, whether they like the status quo or not, about Britain adopting a new, yet to be defined, political culture, in a world increasingly full of hostile states and authoritarians. Contempt for the Labour-Tory duopoly could turn to nostalgia ifNigel Faragewelcomes Vladimir Putin to Downing Street.Yet until Reform UK – or perhaps an equally untried coalition of anti-Reform parties – is tested and constrained by holding office, then Britain’s new politics remains free to develop in many parallel, largely uninhibited ways. What might these political futures be?Some relatively optimistic centrists and leftists atthe journal Renewaland the pressure group Compass see the need for ananti-Reform popular frontalso as an opportunity: to finally begin Britain’s shift to a European-style politics of coalition and proportional representation. Strikingly this year, despite all the government’s troubles and Reform UK’s poll breakthroughs, the combined support for Labour, the Lib Dems and the Greens hasn’t fallen much: from 48% in January to 44% now, according to the websitePolitico’s latest poll of polls. Meanwhile, support for the left-leaning SNP and Plaid Cymru has held steady. The widespread idea that Britain has recently become a much more reactionary country is more of a rightwing hope, and leftwing fear, than a description of reality.But the problem for those who see potential in the poll trends for a long-term progressive majority at Westminster is that this year another, almost equally large bloc has beenforming: on the right. The combined Tory-Reform UK vote was 46% at the start of January and is 48% now. WithTory defectionsto Reform continuing, the parties’ approaches to immigration and many other issues blurring, and the denials that they will form an alliance sounding steadily less definitive, the prospect is growing of a confrontation – perhaps lasting years – between two multi-party blocswith deeply opposed values. The Brexit wars may come to seem modest by comparison.Our electoral system’s unsuitability for this kind of fragmented and polarised politics adds another new layer of uncertainty. The next general election could see four, or even five – if Reform’s recent dip in the polls continues – parties get a similar number of votes, yet win wildly diverging numbers of seats. A distortion of democracy on this scale has never happened in Britain before. How the winners and losers from such a lottery would react, and how the random quality of the results would affect the legitimacy of whatever government emerges, whether in the eyes of voters, financial markets or foreign states, are questions that Westminster is generally avoiding.The election may not be for another three-and-a-half years: a long time in today’s accelerated politics. During this period of waiting some of Britain’s old political habits could reassert themselves. Some voters may return to the traditional main parties, especially if Farage’serratic responseto the allegations about his schooldays proves to be a sign of fragility under pressure.This year, the two once-dominant parties have returned to some old themes. Labour policies such as unapologeticallyraising taxes on the richhave begun to echo postwar social democracy, while the Tories have returned to their own familiar territory ofmoralising about benefits claimantsand promising austerity. If Kemi Badenoch continues to improve as Tory leader, and if Labour can somehow refresh its own leadership, then it’s possible that 2025 will be remembered as the end of an era of intense political instability, rather than its beginning.Yet an even more turbulent late 2020s feels more likely. Voters have so many reasons to stay angry, from depressed earnings to the elevated cost of living. Online politics has been designed by tech companies never to calm down. Meanwhile, in France, the continuedrise of rightwing populism, despite successive electoral coalitions constructed to keep it out of office, suggests that such tactics only work for so long.If Reform UK does win power, itsbullying but ineptrecord in local government suggests that it, in turn, will struggle to satisfy enough voters. A failed Reform government could then push our politics back into its old comfort zone, or further away from the traditions of British democracy, into the unknown.Andy Beckett is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

I think you can in fact teach an old dog new tricks, as long as the old dog is open-minded and willing to learn. As long as the old dog is willing to admit when it was wrong, and work to become a better dog.OK yes, I am the old dog. And the trick I am trying to learn, even though I am decrepit? It is an important one, something I have struggled with, frequently, for my entire life. I have been trying … to become less scared of huntsman spiders. Apologies to all the other spiders that exist; I have to be realistic about my possible growth as a human. It also has to be the huntsman because it is large, in charge, and the one I encounter most often. Including three times in the last week. Inside my home. You can’t see me but I’m shaking my head and grimacing as I type.I knew one day I’d have to watch powerful men burn the world down – I just didn’t expect them to be such losers | Rebecca ShawRead moreI doubt I’ll ever reach “fan” status, but I’ve been working on at least becoming Normal about them.I have been terrified of spiders since I was a child (unlike other children who adore them). Growing up, I had ample brothers around to make sure I never had to engage with any personally, but I still freaked out if one was visibly in the same room as me. I have a strong memory of one morning when I was eight, my family still asleep, and trying to deal with a spider that had crawled on to the lounge-room wall. I “dealt” with it by standing incredibly far away, almost into the next room (in case it ran after me), and spraying half a bottle of insect spray toward it. It didn’t reach the spider, but it did reach and annoy everyone in my house.As I got older, whoever I was dating or living with was, by default, the least afraid of spiders between us, and therefore in charge of dealing with it, while I made low keening sounds and ran away. If I was on my own, my tactic was simply to leave the room, turn off the light and try to forget about its existence before I had to enter again.Recently, I stayed at a friend’s house where there was a very large huntsman who lived in the window frame, mostly just hanging out. In order to be less scared of it, I imagined the spider as a her, a girlie, one of us, just chilling in the sun and listening to us yap. It sounds extremely dumb, but it worked (a little bit). Or, actively deciding to become less scared worked.Whatever the case, I’ve tried to keep it up. I think about all the logical reasons not to be scared. I know huntsman spiders won’t harm me. I know they eat things like flies and mosquitoes (my mortal enemies). I know they are one of nature’s beautiful, harmless-to-humans creatures.In Australia: giant spider carrying a mouse is horrifying and impressiveRead moreUnfortunately, however, they do continue to walk likethat.They move in the most terrifying and borderline immoral way imaginable. The sight of their many legs carrying them at that terrible speed causes my caveman brain to kick into overdrive. They claim to only have eight legs, but I believe that triples when they move.But it isn’t their fault that they have scary legs, and they have just as much right to be where I am – if not more. I’ve found that taking the steps of trying not to immediately exit my own skin and run away when I see one, trying to remain still and breathing, and deliberately thinking about their positive qualities, has actually started to help.Just because they are hairy creatures that scuttle about extremely quickly in a way that haunts my sleep, doesn’t mean they deserve my hatred, or my girly screams. I can admit when I’ve been wrong and driven by unfounded fear. I’m not sure I’ll ever make it to the “catching one in a Tupperware container and taking it outside” stage, but you never know. There’s a few years left in this old dog yet.Rebecca Shaw is a Guardian Australia columnistExplore more on these topicsSpidersOpinionWildlifecommentShareReuse this content"

On the ground floor, there’s a corner for foreign literature and another for French literature, with the latest releases right at the front. For nonfiction and essays, you used to have to go downstairs. But two years ago, they put a new table in front of the French literature corner for feminist essays and memoirs. A prime spot for people to grab a piece of the revolution without thinking about it too much. This change took a wild turn when local geniusAnnie Ernauxwon the Nobel prize in 2022. Where should we put her work: in the crowded space for new French literature or the feminist memoir table?This dilemma is now a regular question in France. The Anglosphere and other European countries have been wrestling with it over the past two decades, but here the line between fiction and nonfiction has only just begun to vanish in the minds of authors and their editors. Should we put a new table between the two? It would be a perfect spot for great autofiction such as Édouard Louis’s or Christine Angot’s novels. Or deeply personal nonfiction such as Alice Coffin’s Le Génie Lesbien or Adèle Yon’s bestseller Mon vrai nom est Élisabeth – her first novel and a literary quest to reveal the patriarchal violence suffered by the author’s great-grandmother. More than 150,000 copies have been sold since its release in February.Much of the new work released this year falls in such a literary no man’s land. In 2025,484 new novelshit the market in France. Many of the authors chose to shine a light on their matriarchal figure. Amélie Nothomb – one of the most prolific and creative novelists in the country – wrote about her mother in Tant mieux. Emmanuel Carrère, best known for his disturbing and eccentric novel The Moustache, did the same in Kolkhoze. Raphaël Enthoven (generally more prolific on foreign politics than literature) wrote about his mother and her sickness in L’Albatros. Matthieu Niango’s Le Fardeau explores the peculiar story of his mother, born in a Nazi maternity ward. Others chose to focus on an absent paternal figure: Anne Berest in Finistère takes the opportunity of his father approaching his last breath to truly get to know him; in Jacky, Anthony Passeron knits a patchwork of the few memories his father created in his childhood before vanishing into thin air.This convergence of so many authors into a similar theme was the main angle of media coverage during the autumn literary season. “The literary season firmly focused on the family” (Radio France), “Literary season 2025: 9 books on family roots” (Vogue), “Our Selection of 7 Powerful Novels About Family Roots, Secrets, and Legacies” (Pélerin), “A literary season that puts light on the ancestors” (Nouvel Obs). It came as no surprise that when the literary prizes began to be awarded, the elite of theGermanopratinacknowledged the effort of authors to expose their roots so sincerely.On 4 November, the prestigiousGoncourt prizewent to La Maison vide, in which Laurent Mauvignier explores the drawers and cupboards of his rural family home to tell his family story through the lives of his grandmother, great-grandmother and great-great-grandmother. “Notably, the four finalist novels draw on autobiographical sources. We are therefore far from the ‘work of prose imagination’ that the Goncourt prize claims to distinguish,”wroteElisabeth Philippe, critic for the weekly magazine Le Nouvel Obs. “But who will complain, since this criterion is no longer particularly relevant in an era when genres are happily hybridising?”From 1903, the Goncourt prize persisted through a great metamorphosis in french literature: in 1919 Marcel Proust won for In Search of Lost Time, his novel of seven volumes flirting with autobiography. In 1977, the author Serge Doubrovskyinvented a wordfor this new way of writing another self: “autofiction”. Since then, in the creative writing classes offered at dozens of universities, students are increasingly taught this approach to write about untold stories from their perspectives – more than they are taught to write fiction from scratch (even if the “scratch” is always personal) or copy US or English personal essay writers, such as Roxane Gay, Rebecca Solnit or Deborah Levy.Anne Pauly is one of them. In 2020, she published her first novel, Avant que j’oublie, inspired by the death of her own father. Like many others, she was amazed to see so many books focusing on parents and family this year. But not completely surprised. “When I wrote my book, the father figure was a big subject. We were justifying our fathers’ conduct or ways of being or not being present. Through my novel, I was looking to go past the faded colours of the ‘ideal father’. After #MeToo and the Pelicot rape trial, it is now time to go past the invisibility of our mothers and grandmothers.”She said she saw in this collective retreat from classic fiction a real panic and desire to put the record straight. “The last people who witnessed Nazi barbarism are dying and we are entering an Orwellian post-truth era, not to mention that a robot knows better than us what to cook for supper. More than ever, we have an urge to hold tight to a disappearing world.” In the Anglosphere, “autofiction” and the turn to memoir was often dismissed as self-involved navel gazing. But inFranceit has hit its stride at a much different time. Perhaps traditional fiction is being put aside for a while in favour of plainly confronting the world. These authors invite us to start a real dialogue within ourselves and open our drawers: because how can we write and read good stories without knowing our own history?Anne-Laure Pineau is an independent writer based in Le Havre, FranceExplore more on these topicsBooksOpinionFranceFictionAnnie ErnauxEuropecommentShareReuse this content"

But I’m hankering after a sea sponge presented by a dolphinThu 25 Dec 2025 03.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 25 Dec 2025 03.25 ESTShareThis Christmas morning, are you worried you didn’t choose quite the right gift for that someone special? I always try my hardest, but everywhere I turn I’m bombarded with unhelpful suggestions. No, I don’t want a candle thatsmells like turkey, because, well, we’ll be cooking turkey. Nor do I want asunrise alarm clockthat mimics natural light, because I can leave the curtains open. And Idefinitelydon’twant a salmon DNA pink collagen jelly mask (Good Housekeeping’sBest for Beauty Lovers), because said DNA comes from milt. AKA semen. If I wanted fish sperm on my face, I would tickle some pollocks.So if, like me, you’re always looking for inspiration, my advice is: learn from the animal kingdom. Humans didn’t inventgifting. The practice has been around for at least100m years, long before our species evolved. With a little help from natural selection, this has given wild animals ample time to perfect the art of giving. Hell, some spiderseven gift-wrap!Excluding exercise-related items and other things I don’t like, there are five categories of Christmas gift: food, things for the home, bling, skincare and clothing. The animal kingdom has them all covered.Brazilian cuckoos give their partners high-protein snacks such asinsects, frogs and lizards, but if you like your meat shished, then the great grey shrike, also known as the butcher bird, has your back.Males impale prey, such as insects and mice, on sharp thorns and twigs to create artisan kebabs.Some insects gift their beaus spitballs, but these aren’t just any spitballs. These are scorpionfly spitballs, crafted with the freshest saliva from the engorged labial glands of only the fittest males. The delicacy is nutrient-dense, which is one of the reasons females prefer males with big balls.View image in fullscreenMale scorpionfly with a sizeable tail.Photograph: Ger Bosma/Getty ImagesAnother reason is that the fittest males make the biggest spitballs, and when I say “fit” I don’t mean “looks great in a leather jacket” (although they probably do). I mean “fit” in the genetic sense. The gifts are given as a prelude to sex, so by choosing the male with the biggest package, the female is also selecting genetic quality.She then consumes the delicacy duringsex but terminates intercourse as soon it’s all gone. Bigger spitballs mean longer copulation times, during which the male can transfer more sperm and the female can’t mate with anyone else. This explains why he bothers with such an elaborate offering.Adélie penguins don’t give food, but they do give things for the home. In Antarctica, where they live, there is no B&Q, so the birds must source their gifts from the local landscape. Each breeding season, males collect pebbles and start making a nest with them. The vital building blocks are scarce, prompting some chancers tosteal pebblesfrom their neighbours, but when a male gives a pebble to a female, it is a sign he is ready to commit. Think of it as the penguin equivalent of a diamond ring. The rock doesn’t go on her finger, however. If she also wants to get serious, she accepts the pebble and adds it to the nest. Then, after a few finishing touches, they are ready to start their family.Speaking of bling, crows excel at this gift category. There are many stories of people who have befriended wild corvids and then been given bottle tops, screws, buttons and other shinyitems in return. In Florida, Alberta and Chuck Holloway evenreceived a diamond braceletfrom a crow they fed regularly. This is particularly endearing because while mostanimals give presents in the hope of scoring (sound familiar?), crows apparently just enjoy giving.In Western Australia, meanwhile, dolphins have been spotted plucking clumps of sea sponge from the ocean floor and using them in interesting ways. Sometimes when they’re rummaging around for fish, theywear the spongeson their beak to help protect their skin. And sometimes, when males want to woo females, theydon them like jaunty hatsbefore presenting them as gifts.In so doing, dolphins brilliantly combine the last two categories of Christmas gift. Sea sponges are clothingandskincare. And if that’s not enough, when males give their sponge hats away, they often strike a U-shaped “banana pose” and play a little tune through their blowhole.This is not the half-arsed giving of domestic animals – my friend’s cat, Lilly, recently presented her with a dead mouse which she then stashed in an obscure corner of the house – or some people I could mention. Dolphin presents are thoughtful, multipurpose, sustainably sourced and delivered with panache. We can all learn from them. Mariah Carey may have said that all she wants for Christmas “is you”, but if I have one Christmas wish, it is to receive a sponge-hat-skin-protector thingy from a cetacean who serenades me with style.Helen Pilcher is a science writer and the author ofBring Back the King: The New Science of De-ExtinctionExplore more on these topicsAnimalsOpinionInsectsBirdsWildlifecommentShareReuse this content"

Today we look at the impact of devolution on growing volatility of party political allegianceThu 25 Dec 2025 12.30 ESTShareNext year will be pivotal in British politics, and 7 May will be the point around which things pivot. Elections to local councils, the Scottish parliament and the Welsh Senedd will give millions of voters across the UK a chance to express party preferences. Their verdicts could imperil Labour and Conservative leaders. In Wales, Labour might be sent into opposition for the first time since devolution.Plaid Cymru and Reform UKare set to make substantial gains. At Holyrood,the Scottish National party (SNP)is on course for a majority. That would be an extraordinary defiance of political gravity for a party weighed down by nearly two decades of incumbency.In England, both Labour and the Tories risk losing scores of councillors as their vote shares are gobbled up by theLiberal Democrats,Reform UKand theGreens. Those results will be taken as evidence that Sir Keir Starmer and Kemi Badenoch are failing as leaders. But it would be a mistake to filter the results only through that lens. The fragmentation of national allegiances began much longer ago.While electorates have routinely used midterm ballots to punish the party in government, devolution changes the calculus of power. The SNP has shrewdly presented itself as a champion of resistance to remote rulers in Westminster, deflecting accountability for its own record in government. In Wales, Labour benefited from a similar dynamic when Downing Street was in Tory hands. That trick is no longer available. The Conservative threat has receded.Eluned Morgan, the Welsh first minister, conceded that sharing a party with the prime minister is a handicap in the Senedd campaign. She asked voters to recognise that “Keir Starmer is not on the ballot paper in this election”.Asymmetric unionResentment at the concentration of power at Westminster has also been a feature of English politics in recent years, but its manifestation has been less explicitly nationalistic, at least in terms of party affiliation. There was a strong element of English exceptionalism,tinged with xenophobia, in the Eurosceptic movement that came to fruition as the campaign for Brexit. That ideological impulse, unsatisfied by release from EU membership, now fuels support for Nigel Farage’s latest vehicle, with a sharpened anti-immigrant focus. As the name indicates, Reform UK doesn’t limit its ambitions to England alone, but that is a function of historic ambiguity in the expression of English nationalism.The differences between England and Britain, clear in legal and geographical terms, have often been blurred in discussions of culture and identity. The terms were often used interchangeably well into the 20th century. That conflation endures in the minds of some English politicians, even if only subconsciously.That legacy complicates the politics of devolution. England is the dominant nation in the union, accounting for around 85% of the UK’s population and a slightly larger share of the economy. The asymmetry was baked into the 1998 devolution settlement that created the Scottish and Welsh parliaments. The lack of specifically English institutions seemed barely relevant. England had ample representation at Westminster.The Labour government at that time perhaps underestimated the potential for the new devolved institutions to pull at the seams of the union. The new constitutional arrangement was designed with the opposite effect in mind. It was meant to neutralise Scottish nationalism in particular. Complacency was encouraged by Labour’s historical strength in Scottish andWelsh politics. Party identity, transcending the union’s internal boundaries, was supposed to be a countervailing factor, resisting centrifugal forces.There seems to be no prospect of Labour’s Scottish hegemony being restored. In Wales, it is in steep decline. In England, where Labour and the Tories have enjoyed dominance in various regional strongholds, devolved institutions are also proving to be catalysts for disruption. In local elections earlier this year,Reform UKcaptured two newly created regional mayoralties – Greater Lincolnshire and the combined authority area of Hull and East Yorkshire.The significance of those gains was submerged in the general scale of Reform UK’ssuccess that night, taking hundreds of seats at local authority level and winning a parliamentary byelection in Runcorn. But more local authorities are due to be combined under the jurisdiction of directly elected mayors, while Labour and Tory poll shares are flatlining. Those are auspicious conditions, not only for Reform UK but for all candidates who stand to gain from the decline of the two big Westminster parties.Centrifugal forcesThe institutional architecture of English devolution is a mess, having evolved ad hoc in sporadic bursts. There is no consistency of size or constitutional status between various metropolitan areas and combined authorities. Resolving some of those imbalances is supposed to be the function of theEnglish devolution and community empowerment bill, currently on its way through parliament. The guiding principle, according to Labour’s 2024 manifesto, is to “transfer power out of Westminster”.There will be some devolution of control from Whitehall, but also a consolidation of regional power at the expense of lower tiers of government. The bill is distorted by tension between the declared commitment to decentralisation and Treasury reluctance to cede meaningful control over fiscal levers. There is also conflict between political and economic motives. The theoretical objective of devolution is to give voters greater agency over what happens in their local area. But the government’s preferred method for boosting growth is through infrastructure andhousebuilding, expedited by decisions directed from the centre.Earlier this month, four new mayoral elections due next May were postponed to 2028. Ostensibly that is to allow time to complete lower-tier council reorganisation, but opposition parties have cried foul. An unpopularLabourparty certainly has diminished incentive to hold ballots that look likely to devolve power to insurgent rivals.That the Conservatives might also suffer is little comfort to Labour. The duopoly that dominated Westminster for generations is in chronic decline. Change started in Scotland; now Plaid Cymru is driving it hard in Wales. Tinkering with the devolution timetable will not stop the same underlying forces expressing themselves in England. Across the multinational union a new political geography is emerging.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

That would indeed appear to be the case. But one can question how far a Labour government should be looking to the commission for guidance. What seems to not be widely recognised is that when in 2021 the commission was reconstituted by Liz Truss, as the then minister for women and inequalities, it took on a highly politicised form. Of its six current members, four have, or have had, Conservative party affiliations.The commission’s recently publishedannual report for 2025provides some useful information on various matters, including regional differences in opportunity structures, youth unemployment and the Neet (not in education, employment or training) problem that the chair now emphasises. However, what also has to be noted from his foreword to the report is the distinct rightwing slant on social mobility that was initiated by his predecessor as chair, Katharine Birbalsingh, and that he maintains.Significant here is the attempt to play down the problem of the persisting very low chances of long-range social mobility between the wage-earning working classes (classes 6 and 7 in theNational Statistics socio-economic classification) and the higher-level professional and managerial salariat (class 1), well documented in sociological research and a major source of talent wastage – apart from any considerations of fairness.But, the chair claims, this is the“wrong problem”because it should not be assumed that such disparities in mobility chances “should be equalised”, and because “too much attention” is spent on the “small number of people from lower socio-economic backgrounds who can get into elite occupations”. It appears to have escaped Mr Francis’s notice that it is precisely the small numbers that are the problem.John GoldthorpeEmeritus fellow, Nuffield College, Oxford UniversityI disagree with the very idea of having a social mobility plan. The term itself captures the essence of what is wrong – class and inequality, and the notion that being upwardly mobile is the path to success. We are still a deeply class-divided society, underpinned by vast differences in economic and educational opportunity that recreate the social markers and attitudinal differences towards achievement and aspiration that constantly divide us.We need an equality plan, not a social mobility one. As in 1997, aLabourgovernment with a huge majority is failing to come up with a narrative that goes beyond ideas that merely tinker around the edges of the real challenge.Christopher TannerSt Ives, CambridgeshireHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Housing remains one of the most critical yet underfunded parts of the national response to abuse. Without a secure home, survivors cannot rebuild their lives, access work or engage with support services.Every week, too many women and families seeking help are turned away because there simply isn’t enough safe, suitable housing available. A survivor can’t start again if they have nowhere to go.Housingassociations are uniquely placed to bridge that gap – combining safe accommodation with specialist, trauma-informed support that helps people rebuild confidence and independence.While the government’s emphasis on prevention and early intervention is welcomed, this must be backed by long-term funding for housing-based solutions that recognise the complexity of people’s lives, including women with multiple needs, male survivors, children, disabled people, and minority communities, who often face the highest barriers to safety.The strategy’s focus on early education and cultural change is encouraging, but housing must sit at the centre of this system of protection. Local authorities and registered providers are often the first point of contact for people at risk, and they need the resources to respond swiftly and safely.I am pleased to see further measures announced to protect women and children, but we now need a joined-up approach that makes housing central to the fight against violence and abuse. A safe home should never be a privilege – it is the foundation for recovery.Helena DoyleCustomerexperiencedirector –wellbeing, StonewaterHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

But here’s why it’s important, 23 December), I would like to say that heartbreak is not just for Christmas. As the mother of a son who has cut himself off from his parents (blocking us on social media and not responding to letters), I can categorically state that the pain is year-round.Like the Beckhams, our situation appears to have started at the time of a marriage, followed by a gradual realisation that for unknown reasons we were no longer acceptable as parents or in-laws, then an abrupt (and inexplicable to us) termination of all contact.Such a situation is especially painful when grandchildren are involved. It breaks my heart that I have not seen my nine-year-old granddaughter for two years and I don’t know what reason she has been given for no longer seeing us. She does not deserve to be denied the fun and love she shared with us in the early years of her life. For any family in similar circumstancesChristmasis a painful time, but that is only part of the story.Name and address suppliedHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Robertson was a hugely important part of the great Forest team that under Brian Clough rose from the second tier of English football to win multiple major honours, most famously back-to-back European Cups.Robertson assisted the decisive goal in the first European Cup triumph in 1979 and scored the decisive goal in the second, contributions that mark him out as one of the most remarkable players in British football history. He earned 28 Scotland caps, notably scoring thewinning goal in a Home Championship victory over Englandat Wembley in May 1981. Clough described him as “the Picasso of our game”.Forest said in a statement: “We are heartbroken to announce the passing of Nottingham Forest legend and dear friend, John Robertson. A true great of our club and a double European Cup winner, John’s unrivalled talent, humility and unwavering devotion to Nottingham Forest will never ever be forgotten. Our thoughts are with John’s family, friends and all who loved him. Rest in peace, Robbo … Our greatest.”A statement from Robertson’s family said: “John passed away peacefully on Christmas morning with his wife and family by his side, after a long illness. Our only comfort in our grief is that his struggles are now over, and he is reunited with daughter Jessica. “Robbo” was treasured by many as a footballing hero but to us he was just John and dad, the family man … kind, loving, witty, fun and loyal. Although our hearts are breaking, we will always be grateful for the years we were privileged to share with him and the amazing memories.”Born in Uddingston, Lanarkshire in January 1953, Robertson played for Drumchapel Amateur FC before joining Forest in May 1970. A winger, he initially struggled to make an impact at the City Ground, mainly owing to a lack of professionalism characterised by a love of drinking, smoking and eating fried food. His career appear to be going nowhere until a showdown meeting with Clough’s assistant, Peter Taylor, in the summer of 1976. Taylor told Robertson in the starkest terms that unless he changed his ways he would be kicked out of the club immediately.View image in fullscreenJohn Robertson pictured in October 2015 outside the City Ground.Photograph: Fabio De Paola/The GuardianRobertson knuckled down and although he did not entirely clean up his off-pitch habits, he did so enough to allow his talent to shine. Two-footed, skilful, imaginative and hard-working, he became a fundamental part of the Forest team that went on an incredibly journey under an incredible manager.Under Clough, Forest won the First Division in 1978, a year after being promoted to the top tier. They also won the League Cup in 1978, a trophy they retained the following season when they secured the first of their European Cups, beating Malmö at the Olympic Stadium in Munich thanks to aTrevor Francis header from Robertson’s driving run and crossfrom the left wing.It was from the same flank that Robertson made the telling contribution in the following year’s final, drifting in before hitting alow, skidding shot from the edge of the areathat sealed Forest’s win over Hamburg at the Bernabéu.Peter Shilton, who also played in those European Cup finals for Forest, wrote on X: “I’m absolutely gutted to hear of the news of our NFFC miracle man Robbo the reunions will never be the same.”Robertson made more than 500 appearances for Forest, scoring 95 goals, another of his most telling being the penalty against Liverpool that sealed the 1978 League Cup in a replay. He joined Derby in 1983 before returning two years later to Forest, where he remained for a season before spells in non-league. Derby said in a statement that their “deepest condolences and thoughts are with John’s family and friends”.View image in fullscreenJohn Robertson played at two World Cup finals for Scotland.Photograph: Mark Leech/Offside/Getty ImagesAfter retiring as a player Robertson had a hugely successful period in coaching, including five years as assistant to his former Forest teammate Martin O’Neill at Celtic, during which the club won three league titles and reached the final of the Uefa Cup. Robertson also worked alongside O’Neill at Wycombe, Norwich, Leicester and Aston Villa.One of his players at Leicester, Stan Collymore, wrote on X that Robertson was “one of the loveliest, kindest-hearted humans I’ve met. At Leicester with Martin O’Neill he knew of my issues and problems and instead like many, who mocked them, he put a literal arm around me, had words of empathy and kindness and genuinely gave me support.”Robertson appeared at two World Cups, scoring in a 5-2 victory over New Zealand at the 1982 finals in Spain. He had made his World Cup debut against Iran four years earlier. The Scottish national team X account paid tribute to Robertson.Clough was not always nice about a player who, by his own admission, was not the most striking of athletes, describing him as “scruffy and unfit” and “a very unattractive young man”, but he was also in no doubt regarding Robertson’s importance to his team. Asked on 27 May 1980, a day before the European Cup final, how Forest would deal with Hamburg’s Manny Kaltz, then considered one of the best right-backs in the world, Clough replied: “We have got a little fat guy who will turn him inside out.” He was proven right.Explore more on these topicsNottingham ForestScotlandnewsShareReuse this content"

The Premier League auction is expected to take place later the same year.The EFL’sdeal with Sky Sportsis worth £935m over five years, giving the broadcaster exclusive live rights to 1,059 games each season from the Championship, League One, League Two, the Carabao Cup and EFL Trophy. The EFL could make all 1,891 of its matches available if it reaches an agreement with the Premier League and Football Association over removing the blackout.The Premier League is also keen to explore selling every game given the declining value of media rights across Europe. Although its domestic deal with Sky Sports and TNT Sports is worth a record £6.7bn over four years, the league added an extra year to the contract and increased the number of games from 215 to 270 each season, so the real-terms value has declined by 23% from the previous cycle between 2022 and 2025.View image in fullscreenThe Premier League domestic deal with Sky Sports and TNT Sports is worth a record £6.7bn over four years.Photograph: Allstar Picture Library Ltd/Richard Sellers/Apl/SportsphotoMany of the Premier League clubs’ American owners have been pushing to broadcast every game for some time, as happens in every sport in the US. The blackout relates to Article 48 of Uefa’s statutes, under which the transmission of live football in a territory can be prohibited for “two and a half hours on a Saturday or a Sunday”. It applies in an English leagues context when 50% of Premier League and Championship matches are scheduled for Saturday at 3pm, a proviso that enabled the EFL to televise all its games on the opening weekend this season because the Premier League did not begin until the following week.The FA, which is responsible for applying to Uefa to impose Article 48 if asked to do so by the leagues, is unlikely to object to the blackout being dropped. Last season there were discussions at the FA about the Women’s Super League being exempted from the blackout, which is in place between 2.45pm and 5.15pm on Saturday, but the Premier League and EFL raised concerns on legal grounds.Article 48 is enforced in Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales so if it is lifted the Premier League and EFL may face demands for compensation from the leagues there. In the event of Article 48 no longer applying in England, 3pm Premier League kick-offs would be broadcast across the UK, which could have a negative effect on attendances.Explore more on these topicsFootballFootball politicsShareReuse this content"

That is my feeling. So you [Mainoo] just need to wait for each chance and everything can change in football in two days. He will have the opportunity that he has all the time to force his way in.”Amorim challenges Manchester United to ‘step up’ after Bruno Fernandes injuryRead moreAmorim pointed to Mainoo’s ability to play a variety of roles. “The position of Casemiro [No 6], he can do it. He can play if we play with three in midfield. He can play like we play in the position of Mason Mount [No 10].”Amorim said this month he wasopen to a loanfor Mainoo, who the United hierarchydo not want to sell, but has now indicated a move would be possible only if a replacement were signed. “If we are not getting someone, it is hard to leave,” he said.With the United captain, Bruno Fernandes, out for a prolonged period with an injury and Bryan Mbeumo and Amad Diallo – two possible No 10s – at the Africa Cup of Nations, Mainoo may get more game time when fit.Amorim has previously suggested he may change from his 3-4-3 system. The Portuguese expanded on why, saying: “We can play a different way to take more quality from these players because I have the feeling that if we have to play a perfect 3-4-3 we need to spend a lot of money and we need time. I’m starting to understand that is not going to happen so maybe I have to adapt.”Casemiro and Harry Maguire are each in the final year of their contracts and Amorim was asked whether a decision has been made on either player. The Brazilian’s deal has a one-year option but his weekly salary of around £365,000 makes him United’s highest earner and means it is unlikely an extension will be triggered.“We need to understand what is going to happen in the next season – if there will be the European games,” Amorim said. “At this moment, we are not thinking about that. I’m really happy with them.”Amorim was glowing in his praise of Casemiro’s work ethos. “If everyone trains like him, if everyone is so focused on the detail, even in training, in set pieces training, even when they are playing 10-versus-goalkeeper, and the movements that he made imagining the game, we will be a top team.”Explore more on these topicsManchester UnitedRuben AmorimnewsShareReuse this content"

It’s not that I believe facilities are the be-all and end-all but they are a great way of setting standards higher and showing your ambition in a clear and strong way.”If Howe struggled to hide his frustration about the lack of final decisions on training ground and stadium projects that could respectively take five and 10 years to complete, he also recognised the need for thoroughness.“The decisions have to be right,” he said. “If extra time is needed to make the right decisions, then take it. You need the right site and designs. I would rather it was correct than rushed.View image in fullscreenNewcastle’s ownership remains undecided on whether to redevelop St James’ Park or opt for a new-build.Photograph: Andy Buchanan/AFP/Getty Images“I know there’s a 99.9% chance that I’m not going to see either completed in my [present] position but I’m still passionate about making sure they’re there for future generations of Newcastle supporters and players.”Regardless of how long he remains in charge, Howe has left a legacy after choreographing last spring’s Carabao Cup triumph. “The last 12 months have been unbelievable for us because we finally won a trophy, and when I came here that was the big aim,” he said. “And it’s a great experience to be in the Champions League again.”Howe admitted, though, that he sometimes struggles for instant job satisfaction. “The word ‘enjoy’ is one I battle with, because, when I go home every day, very rarely will I go: ‘I really enjoyed that,’” he said. “It’s a difficult one because I love coaching. I love being on the grass with the players.“But there’s a lot of the job that sort of gets in the way of that. So while I must ultimately love it and enjoy it, that’s on a more probably subconscious level. A lot of the day-to-day emotions are stress and anxiety.”Nonetheless, Howe agreed 2025 has been the best year of his managerial career. “It has to be. And I have to remind myself of that sometimes. When you feel a bit battered and bruised as you do as a football manager at times, you sometimes have to take a step back and see things for what they are and not what people tell you they are.“It’s been a great year, 2025, and one that in the future I will look back on and really appreciate even more than I do right now. But the challenge never stops and you want to make 2026 even better and that is the tricky part. “Explore more on these topicsNewcastle UnitednewsShareReuse this content"

Although the Commanders (4-12) cut the gap to a touchdown on three different occasions, they couldn’t complete the comeback and absorbed their 10th loss in 11 games.Both teams were previously eliminated from playoff contention, which severely lessened the significance of this matchup between longtime NFC East rivals.Prescott completed 19 of 37 passes and helped Dallas convert all six of its fourth-down tries. His two TD passes gave him 30, tying Tony Romo’s franchise record of four seasons with at least 30 touchdown throws.Prescott shrugged off six sacks, including three by Jer’Zhan Newton.Playing without injured quarterbacks Jayden Daniels (elbow) and Marcus Mariota (quad, hand), Washington turned to 39-year-old journeyman Josh Johnson. Making his 10th career start and first since 2021, Johnson went 15 for 23 for 198 yards with no touchdowns or interceptions.Jacory Croskey-Merritt scored on runs of 10 and 72 yards for Washington. The latter touchdown got the Commanders to 24-17 in the third quarter, but Dallas restored its double-digit lead with a 52-yard field by Brandon Aubrey.Aubrey added a 51-yarder to make it 30-20 with 3:59 remaining.After Prescott threw a seven-yard touchdown pass to tight end Jake Ferguson on the game’s opening drive, Johnson went 3 for 3 for 68 yards to get Washington to 7-3. The key play was a 41-yard completion to Deebo Samuel, Johnson’s longest since 2018. Samuel finished by running into Donovan Wilson, knocking the safety’s helmet off.On their second possession, the Cowboys converted three fourth downs on a 17-play march that ended with a touchdown run by Javonte Williams. Prescott then made it three TDs in three drives with an 86-yard scoring pass to KaVontae Turpin.Detroit Lions 10-23 Minnesota VikingsThe Detroit Lions have gifted the division rival Green Bay Packers a spot in the playoffs.With six turnovers in a 23-10 loss to the Minnesota Vikings on Thursday, Detroit were eliminated from postseason contention – clinching at least a wild-card berth for Green Bay.After taking the past two NFC North titles, reaching the conference championship game after the first one and posting a franchise-record 15 wins for the second one, the Lions (8-8) lost their third straight game in a sloppy performance unfit for the NFL’s Christmas Day showcase.Jared Goff was charged with three lost fumbles, twice on errant snaps by backup center Kingsley Eguakun, and threw two interceptions after just six giveaways over the first 15 games this season. The Lions entered the week with only eight turnovers, the fewest in the league.Explore more on these topicsNFLDallas CowboysWashington CommandersUS sportsShareReuse this content"

We’d triumphed in 1951, 52 and 55. Wembley was our second home. But it took nearly two decades to return for the FA Cup – in 1974 – for a loss to Liverpool, compounded by the crowing Emlyn Hughes. We lost the 1976 League Cup final against Man City and more than 20 years later experienced yet more Wembley anguish at the hands of Arsenal (1998) and Manchester United (1999). At least the black and white jester’s hat got a couple of outings …2023’s Carabao Cup finalwas the first I attended with my son, Richard. Maybe that was the omen that our Wembley bogey would end? Nope … but at least I could share the misery with him. Fast forward to 2025 and victory over Liverpool. Euphoric? You bet we were! To paraphrase the famous anthem: “Seventy years of hurt, never stopped me dreaming.”David HolmesView image in fullscreenNewcastle fans Richard Holmes (left) and his father David Holmes (right) at the Carabao Cup final against Liverpool at Wembley.Photograph: Richard HolmesSon’s view:Born in the late 70s, I’d seen my share of false dawns. Both Keegan and Sir Bobby’s thrilling sides were good enough to have at least won a cup, but they’d fallen short. By the time of Mike Ashley’s hope-sapping regime, dreams of glory had turned to dust, and been trodden into the floor of a Sports Direct warehouse. I’d given up on the idea of hugging my dad as we celebrated on the final whistle at Wembley, of seeing a Newcastle captain lifting a trophy, of knowing what victory felt like. We were perennial underachievers. The 2021 takeover – andEddie Howe’s appointment– changed the script. We finally had ambition, plus the talent to match. And in March we had our moment in the Wembley sun. To be there in the stands with my dad, savouring that victory over Liverpool, meant the world to me. I’ll never forget it.Richard HolmesRory McIlroy13 April 2025:Won Masters, beating Justin Rose in a playoff, 16 years after his Augusta debutI don’t know how Rory felt on that final day, how he managed to handle it. It shows you how mentally strong he is, to handle that sort of pressure for that long, constantly thinking about it and what he’s about to achieve.At HolywoodGolfClub, Rory’s home town club – where I’m the head professional – there were people watching who were members at the club when he was a kid and they were completely overjoyed for him, knowing what it meant to him and his family. After Rory’s victory, we’ve been inundated with junior memberships, all these kids wanting to be the next Rory and join our junior golf programmes with the hopes that someday it’ll be them.A couple of weeks ago I had a gentleman on the phone who was looking to sign his son up. I explained to him that you can come up and fill in a form, but we’re at capacity at the minute with our junior memberships and that he’ll go on our waiting list. He went: “Oh no, it’s OK. He’s only two at the minute.”We’ve had podcasters and influencers come up to see where he grew up, the fairways he’s walked, and they come into the pro shop and they see his parking space outside and always wonder: “Will he arrive today?”What he’s done in golfhas not only helped Holywood Golf Club but the whole of Northern Ireland. It’s brought golf to another level. He’s box office.Ciarán LaveryCrystal Palace17 May 2025:Won FA Cup, beating Manchester City 1-0 at Wembley, the first major trophy in their 120-year historyView image in fullscreenJo Harman-McGowan (right) watching Crystal Palace at the FA Cup final against Manchester City in May 2025.Photograph: Joe DromeyWe’ve all been here before, 1-0 up against a Manchester heavyweight, within touching distance of a first major trophy. But this time it feels different. There’s no touchline dad-dance when Eberechi Eze meets Daniel Muñoz’s cross on the volley. Ollie Glasner’s team have developed a swagger that falls just the right side of cocky, preserving what makes Palace distinctly Palace while elevating us to more than plucky underdogs. The players understandwhat the club means to its supporters, and the fans love them for it. Under relentless first-half pressure at Wembley, it’s that connection which drives us.Dean Henderson’s penalty save sparks celebrations almost as wild as those which followed Eze’s goal. We later learn he probably shouldn’t be on the pitch, but no one cares. The second-half onslaught we’re all expecting never materialises. City, for all the riches emerging from their bench, have run out of ideas. Jean-Philippe Mateta, our No 9-cum-cheerleader, calls on us for one last effort as we approach the last 15. The added time is agony – 10 minutes! – but where previous Palace sides would have buckled, I feel disarmingly confident that this time we’ll pull it off. There’s desperation for the final whistle in the stands, but on the pitch the players are calm.When it finally arrives, it’s carnage. I’ve never been surrounded by so many people in tears. Lifetime supporters who never thought they’d see the day. Kids who don’t know just how lucky they are. It’s beautiful. Walking home through Brixton in my Palace shirt and scarf at the end of the night, receiving what feels like a guard of honour from south Londoners who understand what it all means, I realise winning will never feel this good again.Jo Harman-McGowanTottenham Hotspur21 May 2025:Won Europa League, beating Manchester United 1-0 at San Mamés, Bilbao, their first trophy in 17 yearsView image in fullscreenTottenham fan Rob Davies (pictured at half-time and full time) at the Europa League final against Manchester United in Bilbao.Photograph: Rob DaviesAs the last few seconds ebbed away, events in the San Mamés stadium seemed to unfold in cinematic slow-motion. Barring some freak mishap – and one of those is never far away when you’re a Spurs fan – I was on the verge of seeing my team lift its first trophy in 17 years, a prestigious European pot to boot. When you’ve invested more than three decades of time, effort and money – for relatively little reward in terms of silverware – it can be hard to believe that you’re about to get what you’ve dreamed of.Asense of the unrealdescended, making it impossible to fully grasp the moment. I put in my noise-cancelling headphones, in the hope that drowning out the crowd would somehow help me process the moment. It didn’t. When the ref finally blew, of course there was wild screaming, hugging of strangers, singing, the sheer joy of watching the players charging about madly in random directions. Yes still, none of it felt real. Perhaps I had squeegeed every last drop of serotonin out of my brain already and there was simply nothing left to create emotions.It was only the next day, after a sleepless night, that it began to sink in, as I watched the fan reaction videos and the replays, of Johnson’s goal, of Van de Ven’s miracle clearance, of the bench when the final whistle went. It was then that the tears came, great sobs of happiness welling up periodically, at breakfast, at the airport, when I saw my kids and my toddler began singing: “We won it in Bilbao.” Thingsaren’t going too well right nowat Spurs but I turn to those moments whenever I need to put a smile on my face. And I’ll be doing that for the rest of my life.Rob DaviesParis Saint-Germain31 May 2025:Won Champions League, beating Inter5-0 at Allianz Arena, Munich, their first European Cup win 39 years after their competition debutPSG are a club that are 55 years old and have won more than 50 trophies. But the long wait for us was around the Champions League; since the Qatari takeover in 2011 that had been the goal, the objective. When we finally won it against Inter, there was a sense of relief.We’ve had some crazy scenarios over the last 10 years in Europe, with everybody laughing at us, like that gameat Barcelona when we lost 6-1. Knowing us, I had doubts until the fourth goal in Munich. It is completely irrational when you think about it because we were so dominant and Inter had almost no chances, but we also had in mind what had happened with Inter andtheir comeback against Barcelonain the semi-finals.In terms of the emotion among fans in the stands, it seemed to peak around the second and third goals. That’s when people started to realise two things: first, that we’re going to win the game, and secondly, that we were doing something historical in how we were destroying a team in the final. When you look back at it, thank Godwe lost the final against Bayern Munichin 2020, when there were no supporters there because of Covid. To win our first Champions League title in a great stadium with everybody watching on a sunny day made things perfect.Renan LesaffreBath14 June 2025:Won Premiership final, beating Leicester 23-21 at Allianz Stadium, their first league title in 29 yearsView image in fullscreenMike Elliott (right), with his wife and son outside Twickenham, before the Premiership Rugby final between Bath and Leicester.Photograph: Mike ElliottI’ve been with Bath since back in the 1960s. My grandfather took me to my first game when I was 14, so I was there long before the halcyon years in the 80s and 90s and now I’ve been there long after them, too. We lost to Saintsin the final in 2024, when we were down to 14 men, but they’d played better rugby than us all year. This year was different, we’d been top of the league all season. Leicester still ran us close. I think all the commentators assumed Bath were going to walk it, but it was such a nervous occasion. Tigers played really smart rugby and it ended up being one of those games you say “never in doubt” but you don’t really mean it. It was a bit like we’d saved our worst performance till last. My son’s a Tigers fan, and even he agreed we deserved to win it.Next day we had an open-top bus parade and I know some of the people at the club were worried no one would turn up. In the end it felt like the whole city came out for it. Being aBathfan at the Rec is not always the best experience, I sit in the open stands, and when it’s raining you get wet through, and the rugby’s not always been the best, but the place is still sold out every week. I feel like the title was a reward for all that loyalty the fans have shown over the years. The people I sit with have already booked their tickets for this season’s Champions Cup final in Bilbao next summer, but I’ve not done it yet, I’m too worried I’m going to jinx it.Mike Elliott (Bath Rugby Supporters Club chair)India Women2 November 2025:Won Women’s Cricket World Cup, beating South Africa by 52 runs at DY Patil Stadium, Navi Mumbai, 47 years after their tournament debutView image in fullscreenMembers of the Bucket Hat Cult during India’s run to the Women’s World Cup final.Photograph: Unnati NaiduWe’d probably never played a match of greater stakes than this World Cup final: home ground, high expectations, an incredible run to the final.

I was also hoping that we’d get a 50-over match in because it was raining quite a bit.I was watching the match with a lot of my friends; we’re part of a group called the Bucket Hat Cult. We’re a loud and proud supporters group of Indian women’s cricket, and all of us had been travelling for the group games, made it for the virtual quarter-final, the semi-final, and we had already bought tickets for the final, even before India made it. And it was 10 hours of singing, dancing, chanting, and eventually crying and celebrating that win.The winning moment was incredible. It was just surreal and fitting that Harmanpreet Kaur, the captain, took that last catch. It’s really hard to describe what this is going to do for women’s cricket in India. That’s a question that everyone is asking. I just hope that the women’s team is not an afterthought anymore. I hope tickets are released on time. That it’s accessible and affordable for fans to go and watch. That the game is promoted well and players are paid well, too. That’s going to be a win for us.Radha Lath GuptaExplore more on these topicsSportNewcastle UnitedRory McIlroyGolfCrystal PalaceTottenham HotspurParis Saint-GermainfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Gaelic Warrior raced into a clear lead before being closed down by Fact To File going to the second-last, then stayed on again to win by a neck.Enchantingly old-school Mr Vango can thrill with Welsh Grand National winRead moreWhile it was a candidate for race of the season, however, it was also an unusually punishing return to action for both horses, with a timefigure close to Gold Cup-winning standard. Whether either will run to the same level over an extra half-mile just 33 days later has to be a concern at the available odds.Jango Baie, last season’s Arkle Trophy winner over two miles, has attracted plenty of support in recent days and looked to have improved further over the summer as he cantered home in a Grade Two at Ascot last month.But he will be stepping up to three miles for the first time on Friday, in an unusually strong renewal, while The Jukebox Man has already shown his aptitude for both track and trip in the Kauto Star Novice Chase on the same card 12 months ago.The seven-year-old also enjoyed a much less demanding warm-up than Gaelic Warrior and Fact To File in a graduation chase at Haydock in mid-November, form that was franked when Iroko, the runner-up, went in at Ascot on Saturday.The Jukebox Man has something to find with several rivals on ratings, but Friday’s race will be just his fourth start over fences, he is already a superb and assured jumper, and a high-class, strongly run King George could well be the ideal scenario to take his form to a new level.Kempton 12.45Noble Park has been hiked 11lb for a wide-margin win last time and James Owen’s progressiveSecret Des Dieuxis an interesting each-way alternative at around 10-1.Aintree 1.05Willie Mullins has a host of lightly raced novice hurdlers entered up over the festive period but, as things stand, Dan Skelton’sMydaddypaddyis the ante-post favourite for the Supreme Novice Hurdle in March.

For sure there had been challenges en route to a 20th league title, but not many, and those that did arise were dealt with in a calm, orderly fashion. The ultimate prize had been captured with minimum sweat.Cue the celebrations after afinal‑day 1-1 draw with Crystal Palace: players and staff dancing on the pitch, supporters doing the same in the stands, and no sense this was as good as it was going to get for the just-crowned champions. It took less than 24 hours for everything to change and set in motion an astonishing seven‑month period in the history of a club where it was probably thought they had seen and done it all.Frank hits back at Slot over claim of ‘reckless’ Van de Ven challenge on IsakRead moreChaos, fear, tragedy, excitement, joy, despair, farce, fallout and setback after setback – it’s been there in one form or other for Liverpool since the Palace game, starting on the afternoon of Monday 26 May with a trophy parade that drew thousands of people to a 10-mile route through the city. Heavy rain lashed down but that was stopping nobody from rejoicing, including those at the top of an open-top bus where Van Dijk had the Premier League trophy in his hands for a second day in a row but this time with shades on and Calvin Harris at his side. It was a party all right and looked set to continue into the night, but then camethe incident for which the parade is remembered– a car ploughing into more than 130 people, with injured victims ranging from a six-month-old to a 77-year-old woman. The horrific moment led this month to the 54-year-old dad-of-threePaul Doyle receiving a jail sentence of more than 21 years.That has brought a level of closure for those affected but the sadness and pain will never fully recede, something that can also be said about thedeath of Diogo Jota in July. It is impossible to quantify the impact the sudden loss of a beloved figure has had on everyone associated with Liverpool, and especially those who knew him personally. Andy Robertson’s comments after Scotland sealed qualification for the World Cup with a4-2 victory over Denmark at Hampden Parkspoke volumes. “I’ve been in bits today,” the left‑back said. “I couldn’t get my mate Diogo Jota out of my head. We spoke so much about the World Cup. He missed out last time because of injury, I missed out because Scotland didn’t qualify, and we always discussed what it would be like.”Immense grief does not pass, certainly not quickly, and as Robertson’s words in November highlight it is still very much there for Liverpool’s players, affecting their minds and, consequently no doubt, their performances, which, to be frank, have been dreadful this season. Nine defeats came in 12 games, with a team renowned for sturdiness and control conceding 10 goals in the final three of those through a combination of individual and collective head‑loss. It was Liverpool’s worst run since 1953-54 and felt especially remarkable given a start to the campaign that had brought seven successive wins, albeit the signs were there then that not all was right.View image in fullscreenDiogo Jota lifts the Premier League at a jubilant Anfield on the final day of last season. It was the forward’s last appearance at the stadium before his sudden, tragic death.Photograph: Liverpool FC/Getty ImagesThis has been a collapse, pure and simple, and one no one saw coming when Liverpool broke the British transfer record tosign Alexander Isak from Newcastle for £125mon the final day of the window and take their summer spending to more than £440m on, among others,Florian Wirtz for £116mandHugo Ekitiké for £79m. The biggest outlay in the club’s history appeared to set them up for a run of further titles. Instead they have fallen at the first hurdle.Now Isak isout for a couple of months at least with a fractured legsustained in Saturday’s win at Tottenham, with Giovanni Leoni, another summer recruit, out for the season with atorn anterior cruciate ligament sustainedon his debut against Southampton in September. Mohamed Salah is unavailable owing to Africa Cup of Nations duty and may not play for the club again afterthatmixed‑zone interview at Leeds. And then there are all the other things that have taken place in recent weeks, such asEkitiké being sent off for taking his shirt off. Yes, that also happened.“Liverpool’s 2025-26 season has been chaotic,” says the freelance football writer and lifelong supporterAndrew Beasley. “Emotions have, understandably, veered all over the place and overall it’s been exhausting to watch. But despite the low points, the club should persist with Arne Slot. How many multiple league-winning managers are out there if they don’t? So much has been invested in the new-look Liverpool, Slot needs time to mould it.”That is reasonable, albeit Slot has hardly helped with some of his tactics, team selections and general handling of the squad. Equally, he has shown grace under fire and proved to be a compassionate and considerate figurehead in the aftermath of the parade and Jota’s death. For Slot as much as anyone this has been the most trying of times, stretching his remit of “head coach” to the limit, and as he moves through the festive period into the new year the one thing the Dutchman may desire more than anything is a return to the peace of old.In that regard it helps that Liverpool’s next game is at home against Wolves. Rob Edwards’ side will arrive at Anfield on Saturday with two points from 17 games and on course to be the worst‑performing side in Premier League history. This should be a straightforward win for the hosts. But, then again, nothing has been straightforward for them since that increasingly distant joyful spring day.Explore more on these topicsLiverpoolfeaturesShareReuse this content"

No one is addressing the question: if you can’t afford to buy, will you be able to move to a new town?”View image in fullscreenA protest sign in Adlington, which has been recommended for development by the government’s new towns programme.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianIn September, the government’s new towns taskforcepublished a list of 12 potential locations for the next generation of new towns, as part of the prime minister’s commitment to building1.5m homesand solving the country’s housing crisis.Keir Starmer said he wants to begin building at least three new towns this parliament, and commence work on more if possible.Shostak said none of the proposed new towns were on the scale of Milton Keynes or other large new towns, and he was concerned whether there was the strength of leadership and resources behind the project for it to make a substantial difference.“Many of the areas designated for the fourth generation of new towns are not actually standalone new towns at all – they’re modest expansions of existing communities, and some are regeneration projects within existing towns and cities,” he said. “So the challenge will be to bring the prosperity, the excitement and the vision.”John Walker, who became planning director of MKDC in 1980 and went on to become chief executive of the Commission for the New Towns, said that while the new towns were an exciting prospect, there were worries about how it was being executed.“I am concerned that it’s not ambitious enough. There’s nowhere that would compare with the later-stage new towns,” he said. “I don’t think it is going to be enough, and I’m ambivalent about whether it’s going to produce the sort of results that people want to see.”View image in fullscreen‘Milton Keynes didn’t just happen because it was a good location. We made it happen because we were given the powers and the resources to make it happen.’Photograph: Rui Vieira/PABoth arrived in Milton Keynes when it was mainly mud and building sites – “it really was Frontierland”, Walker said – and watched its population swell as homes were built at a pace of about 3,000 a year.They said the key to the new programme’s success would be the creation of government-backed new town corporations with land ownership and planning powers that could deliver homes and infrastructure at scale.Without that, there are fears the project may lack momentum, and the private sector may be unwilling to take on risk.“There’s very little point in talking about doing more new towns if all you’re going to do is draw a big blob on a plan and say one day that will be a new town – you’ve got to accelerate the pace,” he said.Shostak added: “Milton Keynes didn’t just happen because it was a good location. We made it happen because we were given the powers and the resources to make it happen. That’s the opportunityEnglandhas today, to do it again.”While some of the proposed new town locations have been welcomed, there has been a backlash in others.In the village of Adlington inCheshire, there has been anger from local residents over proposals to build 20,000 new homes on their doorstep in a new standalone development.It has been formally opposed by Cheshire East council, while the leader of neighbouring Stockport council, Mark Roberts, likened it to “someone in a boardroom in Westminster throwing a dart at a map”.“It’s not an exaggeration to say the whole village is traumatised,” said Aysha Hawcutt, an Adlington resident campaigning to stop the new town going ahead.“If we could see in our local area there was a need for the sort of housing that’s going to be built, then I think we would accept it more. But we know these plans don’t fix any problem, they just make money for a private company.”Katy Lock, the director of communities at the TCPA, said “there was no strategic approach to identifying locations” for the new towns and there had not been enough public engagement in the process.“There is such mistrust in planning in the public’s mind and there is an opportunity with this new towns programme to be more transparent and bring people along in the process – and I feel that opportunity has been missed,” she said.She said new towns were a chance to create “exemplar high quality places that are genuinely affordable” and with the right environmental standards – “however, to make that happen there needs to be a real change”, she said.A spokesperson for theMinistry of Housing,Communitiesand Local Government said: “We reject these claims. We welcome the Taskforce recommendation that 40% of the homes in our new towns should be affordable housing, and our New Towns programmes will restore the dream of homeownership for families across the country, helping fix the housing crisis we inherited.“We continue to work closely with local leaders to ensure these towns will be in the right places and have the necessary infrastructure.”Explore more on these topicsHousingCommunitiesLabourMilton KeynesPlanning policyCheshireEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

Hastings residents were left without water for four days in May 2024 after a pipe burst, which was flagged for replacement in 2007 but never fixed. Multiple pipes in the Hastings area have previously been listed by the company as “aged assets prone to failure”.A bottled water station in Pelham Place car park on Carlisle Parade in Hastings was open until 10pm on Christmas Day.Southern Water has deployed a fleet of tankers to inject water into the network and the reservoir, saying: “This process takes time, but we’re already seeing gradual improvements.”The problems are expected to be “temporary”, the supplier said, adding: “If you do have water, please use it responsibly, as reservoir levels remain low and demand is very high.”Helena Dollimore, the Labour MP for Hastings and Rye, said: “I’m angry that Hastings once again is paying the price for the failures of Southern Water.“Our town’s water infrastructure is not fit for purpose after years of neglect, and Southern Water must do better.“I am pushing Southern Water to get us back in supply as quickly as possible and minimise the impact on residents by supplying bottled water and opening plenty of water stations.“I’m also asking them to supply extra water to our pubs and restaurants who are particularly busy at this time of year. Once we are through this incident, Southern Water must get their act together.“After a major five-day water outage last May when the same pipe burst, and an environmental disaster last month when millions of plastic beads escaped their wastewater plant, we cannot endure any more.”Explore more on these topicsEast SussexWater industryEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

It is caused by a change in one or more genes and mostly passed on through families.Some feel fine most of the time and have few or no symptoms. But others can suffer complications, such as heart failure and abnormal heart rhythms, which can lead to a cardiac arrest.The problem is there is no cure. Doctors alsodo not know which patientswith the genetic condition are most at risk from deadly complications.But now a team of scientists from universities including Harvard and Oxford have found a way to forecast risk for people living with HCM.The blood test could identify those patients most in danger of complications, enabling them to be monitored more closely or receive life-saving treatment.In a landmark study, the team measured the levels of a protein, N-terminal Pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-Pro-BNP), in the blood of 700 HCM patients.NT-Pro-BNP is released by the heart as part of normal pumping. But high levels are a sign the heart is working too hard. Those with the highest levels had poorer blood flow, more scar tissue and changes in their heart which could lead to atrial fibrillation or heart failure.A blood test measuring NT-Pro-BNP could transform the care of millions of people with the world’s most common inherited heart condition.The study leader, Prof Carolyn Ho, the medical director of the cardiovascular genetics centre at Harvard medical school, said the test could help “target the right therapies to the right patients at the right time”.She added: “Continued studies on blood biomarkers will lead to better understanding of HCM so that, in future, we can offer our patients a blood test to identify who is at high versus low risk of experiencing serious consequences of the disease.“People with the highest risk could be targeted for potentially life-saving treatments as they stand to receive the greatest benefit, while those at lowest risk could avoid unnecessary treatment.”Lara Johnson, 34, from Southampton in the UK, is one of many who could benefit.Parasite cleanses: why are so many people obsessed with intestinal worms?Read moreEight years ago, she began experiencing breathlessness and fatigue. After being referred by her GP for hospital tests, she was diagnosed with HCM. Several relatives on her father’s side were subsequently also diagnosed with the condition.“One of the hardest parts of living with HCM is the constant uncertainty, never knowing what might change next,” Johnson said. “A simple blood test, which could help identify future risks earlier, would take away so much of that anxiety.”She added: “It could give people like me a chance to prepare and adjust our lifestyles as needed, and help us to feel more in control. That kind of clarity wouldn’t only help me, it would make a world of difference for my whole family.”Prof Bryan Williams, the chief scientific and medical officer of the British Heart Foundation, which funded the research, said the test “could benefit patients around the world”.“After a diagnosis of HCM, patients and their families want to know what the future holds. This study shows that measuring various proteins circulating in the blood could help predict how the heart is functioning and future risk of complications from heart disease.“This new method may also provide insights in the evolution of the structure and function of the heart in people with HCM that could point to new ways of treating this condition to reduce future risk.”Explore more on these topicsHealthHeart diseaseHarvard UniversityUniversity of OxfordMedical researchEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Dr Kate McLean-MacKenzie hopes her new atlas will make scentsNicola DavisScience correspondentThu 25 Dec 2025 12.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 25 Dec 2025 12.04 ESTShareChristmas may be associated with the aromas of oranges and mince pies but our towns and cities also boast special scents during the rest of the year. Now, one researcher is publishing an atlas attempting to capture these quirky “smellscapes”.Dr Kate McLean-MacKenzie, a designer and researcher at the University of Kent, said she first became intrigued by the sense of smell 15 years ago.“I realised that there was an enormous gap in the fact that we communicate what we see – and we can record that and we can share it via Instagram and photography and sketching – and we can record and share sounds digitally. But any way of recording and communicating smell was largely missing,” she said.As a result, McLean-MacKenzie began mapping “smellscapes” in different locations, including many of the world’s cities.This involves asking participants to take “smell walks” on the street – recording not only what they can smell but its intensity and duration, whether it is unexpected, whether they like it or not, and any associations the scent conjures up.“I analyse that data and from it create visual maps and then a sort of cultural narrative about what smell tells you about those cities in response to what came out from the smell walks,” McLean-MacKenzie said. “So it’s all human interpretation, it’s largely subjective, and it’s about the stories that smells lead us to in cities.”View image in fullscreenOne man said a late-night New York walk had ‘the smell of shattered dreams’.Photograph: Charly Triballeau/AFP/Getty ImagesAmong the cities that have been mapped since 2011 are Glasgow, Edinburgh, Canterbury, Amsterdam, Verona, Kyiv, Kolkata and Paris, with the atlas covering 40 locations.While humans’ sense of smellcompared with that of other animalshas long been derided, recent research has shown it is not to be sniffed at: among other studies, scientists have found people can tell apart smells that arise justtens of milliseconds apart.McLean-MacKenzie said the goal of the smell walks was not to identify a scent per se. “It’s about naming it and therefore giving those smells meaning in people’s lives.”Among the examples, McLean-MacKenzie said one participant called a particular waft “the smell of shattered dreams”.“That was somebody in New York who basically said … the smell of shattered dreams is the smell of stale beer on the sidewalk, walking home late at night, single still,” she said.The maps, she added, capture the ephemeral nature of smells, showing the source of the odour on the day the smell walk took place, and where the scent may be blown.“It’s like an impressionist painting of light. It’s a moment in time and the only way that you’ll get to experience it is by going out and smelling for yourself,” she said.McLean-MacKenzie said the maps could become a useful historical record of how cities smell now, because future generations may have different experiences – as electric vehicles proliferate, for example.View image in fullscreenThe smell of petrol on a busy London street may soon be a thing of the past.Photograph: AlamyShe hopes the atlas will encourage readers to engage with all their senses when out walking, and in a physical as well as a digital way.“By engaging with how other people smell spaces in ways that you might not, there’s a level of acceptance, tolerance and understanding of the fact that as individuals we are all very different and we do see things in different ways,” she added.McLean-MacKenzie said even festival-related scents could depend on where in the world someone is.“We can say [the] smells of Christmas are mince pies and Christmas pudding and turkey and fires and all the rest of it,” she said. “But in Kolkata they’re not, they’re smells of Chhena cake and lights and different things happening and different drinks and foods around. And the smell of cold for them is 20C, whereas for us it’s sub-zero.”Smells can even bring surprises: McLean-MacKenzie said that when a participant who recorded smells in Antarctica came across a dead seal, they found it had a pleasant, leather-like odour.“Just because something smells doesn’t mean it’s bad, and it’s only there temporarily,” she said. “So get over yourself and go and have a whiff and see what it’s like.”Explore more on these topicsScienceUrban explorationnewsShareReuse this content"

Harper said: “This is a success in so much as every baby that is born will have the opportunity – or should have the opportunity – to be highly educated, healthy and live a long, healthy life.”While acknowledging there would be people living into their 80s and 90s who would become frail and need care, Harper said the main opportunity was to capitalise on the increasing health and education of older adults, especially those aged 50 to 70.She said: “There are some challenges [to an ageing population], but there are also huge opportunities and rather than try and resist it, or stop it, or divert it we should be looking for those opportunities, because we have this massive cohort of healthy, active, older, creative adults.“And because we’re still stuck in 20th-century institutions that don’t appreciate them and benefit from them, we need to create new ways of living and working that enable us to take advantage of that massive group of adults.”Experts have stressed the importance of retraining workers, flexible working and a general shift in attitudes towards older workers. Harper said it was also important to tackle inequalities around health and education so that all older adults could make a valuable contribution.Official figures showthe UK population is growing, largely as a result of migration, but also ageing, with 27% of the population expected to be 65 or older by 2072.While the baby boomer cohort is particularly large,creating a population bulgethat will greatly increase the numbers in the oldest age groups in the coming decades, Harper said younger generations were smaller – and more similar – in size. That means in future the age structure of the population will resemble a skyscraper rather than the traditional pyramid.Harper said: “Providing high quality affordable childcare is the key to unlocking the potential of both younger and older adults.”Yet even Scandinavian countries, which have emphasised gender equality and positive parenting, have failed to raise total fertility rates above replacement level.Harper said: “What we should be doing is saying there are ways that we can support those, particularly women, who want to have children, and that’s around things like good jobs, good housing, good childcare, good gender equality.“But there is always going to be a group, probably growing, of women who have decided that they, for all sorts of reasons, are not going to have children. And in a way, we’ve got to accept that and work with that.”While Harper said concerns over Covid, the climate crisis and overpopulation might be factors in why some have chosen not to have children, she said there were other reasons too, such as not seeing having children as necessarily part of being an adult woman.“I think that is a really big psychological shift,” she said.Harper added the idea that a country needed a high fertility rate was rooted in the outdated view that lots of young people were needed to defend a country. “Actually, we don’t need any more. The world has changed,” she said. “High income countries don’t need babies. We just need to change the structure, the economic structure in particular.”Harper said that people aged 50 to 70 were an “amazing resource” with valuable skills for a knowledge-based economy, with many willing and able to work longer.She said: “People also financially know that if they’re going to retire at 60 and then live for another 40 years … it’s just unsustainable on the kind of pension system we have. One approach to pension reform without disadvantaging people on lower incomes with poorer health and less education would be to link the state pension to national insurance contributions rather than age.”Harper said some had drawn parallels with the rise of women in the workforce.She said: “In the 50s and early 60s, people were saying, ‘Well, what are we going to do if all these women enter the labour market? What are we going to do? It will completely disrupt everything.’ But of course, it happened and now one takes it for granted in many countries [that] of course, women are working equally to men. Well, it’s the same idea for older adults.”Explore more on these topicsAgeingOlder peopleRetirement ageHealthWork & careersnewsShareReuse this content"

And you’re sharing it with a family that’s just gone down to the beach for the day,” says Dr Erich Fitzgerald, senior curator of vertebrate palaeontology at Museums Victoria Research Institute.As powerful Southern Ocean swells erode the rock face and shift massive boulders, a new fragment of whale bone might be revealed, or a battered shark tooth – remnants of the Oligocene, a pivotal moment in the history of the planet, and in the evolutionary story of whales.Retired Australian teacher discovers the oldest fossil of its kind in southern hemisphere – and a new speciesRead moreFor Fitzgerald, the place is “like a magnet”, with every visit offering the tantalising possibility of new discoveries.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailFossils from Jan Juc have revealed the existence of tiny-toothed baleen whales such asJanjucetus dullardi, primitive dolphins with long narrow jaws, and “rather substantial” penguins over a metre tall – all likely to have been preyed upon by a large prehistoric shark calledCarcharocles angustidens, ancestor to theterrifying megalodon.The hunt for fossils is often associated with the outback, places such as Winton, “Australia’s dinosaur capital” in central-west Queensland, a 15-hour drive from Brisbane. But novices, enthusiasts and experts alike can travel back millions of years only a short day trip from Melbourne.View image in fullscreenErich Fitzgerald scouring the Jan Juc coastline for fossils.Photograph: Rodney Start/Museums Victoria“You can find fossils of nearly all geological periods in Victoria … if you know where to look,” says palaeontologist Prof John Long, who began searching the state for specimens at age seven.“Victoria is a small state, but it’s got the mountain belt – the Great Dividing Range – coming right through and twisting around. And because it’s had lots of geological upheavals over millions of years, it’s got very good exposure of almost the entire geological timescale, from the Cambrian to the recent.”Fossils are ‘everywhere’The state has a storied fossil record. Australia’s first known dinosaur specimen – the claw of a small carnivore from the cretaceous period – was found in 1903 near the seaside town of Inverloch, by geologist William Hamilton Ferguson, who was searching for coal. Local discoveries include some of the oldest examples ofland plants, extraordinary examples of extinct marine organisms called graptolites, early fish from the Devonian, andworld famous polar dinosaurs.View image in fullscreenSearching for fossils on the Broken River near Mansfield.Photograph: Prof John LongA more recent example was the discovery offossilised claw printsabout 354m years old – the oldest evidence for amniotes, the ancestors of reptiles, birds and mammals – by locals Craig Eury and John Eason on the banks of Broken River near Mansfield, 200km north-east of Melbourne.Their interest was sparked many years ago, when Long gave a talk at the local library, later taking an enthusiastic group to search at some local sites. “We found plates of ancient armored placoderms. I just showed them how easy it was to actually find stuff, once you knew what you’re looking for. Since then, they’ve been going out by themselves and walking the whole of the basin, finding more material.”Map of fossil sites in VictoriaSignificant fossils are being uncovered every year, says Sally Hurst, the palaeontologist and archaeologist behindFound a Fossil, which offers advice for people who have discovered a fossil or artefact and don’t know what to do next.Most of the time they are not found by scientists, they’re found by members of the publicSally Hurst“You can find them on a beach. You can go on a bushwalk and potentially find something. They are everywhere, and most of the time they are not found by scientists, they’re found by members of the public,” she says.Dinosaurs may be the first thing that comes to mind, but fossils can be any living thing from a past geological age – plants, bacteria or animals that have died and then become mineralised.Finding them can take a bit of practice, she says. It’s a good idea to visit the museum first to know what you’re looking for, and keep an eye out for interesting textures that look different from rock.55m-year-old eggshells unearthed in Queensland may be older relative of infamous ‘drop crocs’Read moreBut there are a few ground rules. No tools, as digging is usually prohibited without a permit. And if you find something of interest, take a photo, drop a GPS pin and contact the museum or Found a Fossil. It’s best to include something in the photo for scale, Hurst says – that could be a ruler, coin, a pencil or even a banana.If you happen to see a dig under way, Hurst says, go and say hello.“Palaeontologists are a very friendly bunch. We’re always happy to answer questions.”Relying on the publicBen Francischelli, a palaeontologist, can often be found in his scuba gear at Beaumaris beach, 20 minutes south of Melbourne’s city centre.The bayside beach with its “strikingly beautiful ochre cliffs” is one of Australia’s most significant urban fossil sites, he says, a treasure trove of marine and land fossils from 5m to 6m years ago.It’s best to visit at low tide and when winds are light, he says, and be careful of the cliffs, which have been known to collapse. It’s suitable for first-time fossil hunters, who may spot a heart urchin or shark’s tooth on the sand. “All you need are your eyes,” he says.Francischelli prefers to search the seafloor, taking care not to disturb any local inhabitants such as blue-ringed octopus or giant smooth stingrays. “My favourite thing to do is to just hold my breath and sink to the bottom, and then kind of walk like a moon man looking for fossils.”Local discoveries can be seen on display next door at thePrehistoric Bayside Museum, housed at the yacht squadron.Those on the hunt for dinosaurs should head east, down the Bass Coast, to a 40km stretch of coastline between San Remo and Inverloch.Lesley Kool, is the longtime coordinator of a project calledDinosaur Dreaming. In 30 years of prospecting at the site, scientists and volunteers have uncovered a diversity of Cretaceous dinosaurs – small and speedy plant-eaters called ornithopods, ankylosaurs, meat-eating theropods, along with freshwater plesiosaurs and flying pterosaurs – along with early mammals (including a minuscule monotreme calledTeinolophos trusleri)and the monster amphibianKoolasuchus cleelandi, all living in what was then a polar environment.At the time, 125m years ago, the coast was a vast rift valley between Australia and Antarctica, and much farther south, she says. “You could have actually walked from the south coast of Australia to Antarctica, [although] you would have had to cross a few rivers.”Bunurong Environment Centreruns guided tours of local fossil sites during school holidays, but because the site is part of the Yallock-Bulluk marine and coastal park, finds can only be collected by someone with a permit. Those wanting to join a dig can register their interest with the Dinosaur Dreaming project.“We really do rely on the public doing the right thing and letting us know when something really significant has been found,” Fitzgerald says. “That enables us to spring into action … collecting those fossils, saving them for science, but also enabling us to save them for everyone to enjoy and learn from.” Finders are recognised in the museum’s collection register.“The search for fossils and learning about our deep prehistoric past must be one of the most satisfying, enriching activities,” Fitzgerald says. It’s “95% walking and looking”, he says, which “forces you to actually stop and just pay attention to your surroundings.“That really opens you up to a whole world of enlightenment and discovery about nature and, indeed, our place in the universe.”Explore more on these topicsFossilsAustralian climate and environment in focusPalaeontologyVictoriaEvolutionGeologyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Photograph: The Darien Landscape Collection by Oyvind Martinsen/AlamyLow-cost tech and joined-up funding have reduced illegal logging, mining and poaching in the Darién Gap – it’s a success story that could stop deforestation worldwideByLuke TaylorThu 25 Dec 2025 10.00 ESTShareThere are no roads through the Darién Gap. This vast impenetrable forest spans the width of the land bridge between South and Central America, but there is almost no way through it: hundreds have lost their lives trying to cross it on foot.Its size and hostility have shielded it from development for millennia, protecting hundreds of species – from harpy eagles and giant anteaters to jaguars and red-crested tamarins – in one of the most biodiverse places on Earth. But it has also made it incredibly difficult to protect. Looking after 575,000 hectares (1,420,856 acres) of beach, mangrove and rainforest with just 20 rangers often felt impossible, says Segundo Sugasti, the director of Darién national park. Like tropical forests all over the world, it has been steadily shrinking, with at least 15% lost to logging, mining and cattle ranching in two decades.But in the past three years, Panama has mounted a surprising fightback that couldoffer hopeto the rest of the world’s forests. In 2022, the government took a hard line ondeforestationand modernised its park ranger force, partnered with the NGO Global Conservation and deforestation in the park began to fall. That fall accelerated when President José Raúl Mulino took office in July 2024.Mulino purged the environment ministry of corrupt officials and introduced a blanket moratorium on logging to stop companies exploiting indigenous logging permits. The park ranger force was expanded with 30 new recruits and 11 forestry officers, swelling numbers from six to more than 40. The number of patrols has grown from almost zero in 2022 to 55 in 2024, with more than 150 expected in 2025.View image in fullscreenPanama’s president, José Raúl Mulino, has taken a hard line on deforestation.Photograph: Enea Lebrun/Reuters“People don’t look at us the same way any more,” Sugasti says. “Now the kids are asking when they can sign up to become a ranger!”In an era when cash-strapped governments are slashing environmental budgets, Jeff Morgan, the director of GlobalConservation, which partners with the park, says: “It’s a miracle.”“I’ve been in this industry for more than 10 years and worked in 22 countries. I’ve never seen anything like this,” he says.Global Conservation supported the park with new trucks, boats, food and fuel, giving the rangers the tools and confidence to reach areas they once avoided. “Now if we have to go by boat, by truck or by foot, we will go there – no matter how far it is. As long as we feel safe and supported, we will do it,” says Esquivel Ramires, a park ranger.‘We’re true guardians of the forest’: quilombola community near Belém demand land rights and recognitionRead moreThe other significant shift has been in the use of technology. With little phone signal in the rainforest, rangers used to spend much of their time incommunicado, chasing ghosts. By the time alerts of intruders clearing trees reached them, they had already vanished. Rangers have now been given access to cameras, satellites and cloud systems, starting with Elon Musk’s Starlink, and are in constant communication with one another, allowing for a quicker, more coordinated response.Sugasti says: “Before, sending a park ranger to remote zones meant risking their life. Now I can send them to the most far-flung corners quickly, knowing they are safe.”Trail cameras automatically detect movements of logging crews and all officers use EarthRanger – a cloud-based park management system that allows them to share photos, GPS locations and incident reports immediately. If a fire is reported inside the park, they can immediately pinpoint the location of the blaze.The platform also links to external sources such as Global Forest Watch’s real-time fire-detection satellites. No fires took hold in the park in 2024 or 2025, Segasti says.In the past, one or two rangers might have arrived late and alone, now teams of five can be rapidly dispatched together. As a result, the team’s presence is more visible and feared and loggers and miners are retreating.“Illegal mining, the poaching of animals and logging is happening a lot less. They are scared of us now,” says ranger Juan Sebuygera, wearing his green standard-issue, wide-brimmed hat.Most remarkable is that the tech is neither costly nor complex, says Kherson Rodríguez, who manages the Darién project for Global Conservation. EarthRanger and Global Forest Watch’s real-time fire alerts are free: all rangers need is access to Starlink and smartphones.Wider financial support also meant five rusting boat engines that had not been serviced for a decade could be repaired.“Before, [rangers] were not able to do their jobs because they lacked basics like oil, fuel or replacement parts. It is [about] being efficient and giving them what they need, when they need it,” Rodríguez says.The results have been staggering. Forest loss inside the national park plummeted by 88% between 2022 and 2025, reaching its lowest level in 20 years, according to Global Forest Watch. So far this year, logging in the park has fallen to nearly zero, the park says.The reclaiming of Darién national park should help protect one of the region’s largest carbon sinks and the Indigenous groups and many animal species that live there. It also comes as tropical forests across Central America are collapsing.“Nicaragua is gone. Mexico, Guatemala – everything is going now. If you look from Google Earth we are down to these little green patches. It’s the last 10% of what was there 100 years ago. So if we don’t get it right real soon …” Morgan says, trailing off, preferring not to elaborate on the implications of losing the greatest intact rainforest north of the Amazon.Tropical forest loss doubled in 2024,reaching the highest level recorded in two decades.Bringing park rangers who still work with pens and notepads into the age of cameras, tablets and cloud computing is a pragmatic way to turn the tide when climate diplomacy at summits like Cop is failing, Morgan says.He says Panama’s turnaround also shows how co-investment – partnering with governments that also invest in conservation – makes rangers more accountable and brings better results. And it is also quicker.“It takes three years to get a USAID or a Defra grant. You do a ton of paperwork, and by the time it’s ready, the government has changed, the president’s now terrible, the park directors are terrible. Everything can be destroyed in that time,” Morgan says.Instead of waiting on climate finance, there should be a push for direct co-investment with governments, Morgan says. “This is just one park. Imagine the difference we could make with just $200,000 a year, times 1,000 parks,” he says.Explore more on these topicsThe alternativesPanamaAmericasDeforestationAmazon rainforestConservationTrees and forestsnewsShareReuse this content"

The groups have spent the best part of a decade knitting together apatchwork of land purchases and state-held propertiesto create the park.In 2023, they signed an agreement with the Chilean government to donate the land to become Cape Froward national park.In February, a population of 10 huemul, an endangered deer species, was found in the park, and a network of cameras regularly captures wild pumas and the endangered huillín, a river otter. The area also encompasses 10,000 hectares of sphagnum bogs, a spongelike moss which stores carbon deep below the ground.View image in fullscreenA waterfall in the strait of Magellan, which links the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.Photograph: Pablo Sanhueza/ReutersBenjamín Cáceres, the conservation coordinator in the Magallanes region forRewildingChile, is a native of Patagonia who first visited Cape Froward at the age of 12 with his conservationist father, Patricio Cáceres.“My father was always a dreamer,” he said. “When he found out about an abandoned lighthouse all those years ago, he brought us here as a family to dream with him – and that’s where this story began for me.”The San Isidro lighthouse is one of seven designed and built by the Scottish architect George Slight along the treacherous strait of Magellan.

There are even circles of stones set out as fish traps on the beaches, and trees stripped of their bark to line the hulls of Kawésqar canoes.View image in fullscreenThe southern Chilean coastline is dotted with archaeological sites that tell the history of the Kawésqar people.Photograph: Pablo Sanhueza/Reuters“The area was widely inhabited by nomadic canoeists who lived by fishing and gathering food,” said Leticia Caro, a Kawésqar activist who belongs to the Nómades del Mar community. “For our community, it is very important to protect this area, where you can also see the different ways of inhabiting the land and seas, and the interaction with other peoples like theYagán, Selknam and Tehuelche.”Long after Indigenous communities had settled in the area, the waters of the strait of Magellan, which the Kawésqar call thetawokser chams, became the link between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Charles Darwin stepped off the Beagleto climb nearby Mount Tarn on his voyage along the coast of Chile and the strait was one of the world’s most important shipping routes until the Panama canal opened in 1914.The murky depths have claimed many lives and spawned legends.

Chile’s environment ministry said it would make “every effort” to advance with plans for the park by March.But if no progress is made after two years, the lands revert to the ownership of Tompkins’ organisations.“Each of the park projects we have developed has specific reasons for being considered essential for conservation,” said Tompkins, who was the chief executive of Patagonia outdoor clothing for 20 years until 1993. “And in this sense Cape Froward is a piece of an ecological puzzle that, over time, should ensure that key biodiversity sites within Chilean Patagonia are permanently protected.”The Guardian’s reporting was supported by Rewilding ChileExplore more on these topicsChileRewildingConservationWildlifeAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

It would be the slowest annual growth in the decade since installations started to take off.The number of electric cars sold is still growing rapidly, accounting for 23% of British sales in the first 11 months of 2025 – up from 19% at the same point last year. However, growth hasnot been as quick as previously expected. Some manufacturers have slowed their switch from petrol to electric, while some investors in charging infrastructure have also slowed down.Carmakers persuaded the UK government to weaken electric car sales targets despitewarnings from the charging industrythat lower sales would imperil investment.Colin Walker, the head of transport at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, a thinktank, said the slowdown in charger installations this year was “no surprise” given the “rather mixed messages on EVs” from the UK government, including anew pay-per-mile tax on electric cars from 2028, announced at last month’s budget.“Its weakening of the zero emission vehicle mandate could incentivise the sale of plug-in hybrids rather than EVs,” he said. “And while it won’t change the fact that EVs will remain considerably cheaper to run, the 3p per mile tax on EVs risks undermining consumer confidence. All of this could slow EV sales considerably, which, in turn, could undermine business confidence and slow investment in the public charging infrastructure this country needs.”Electric car charger chartThere were 48,100 slow chargers at the end of November, an increase of 15% over the year. The number of ultra-rapid chargers, which tend to be used for quick top-ups on longer journeys, rose 39% to about 9,800.Quick GuideElectric vehicle charging speedsShowNot all chargers are created equalMore and more people are buying electric cars, and are having to grapple with charging for the first time. However, not all chargers are created equal, and the profusion of units can cause confusion.Charging speeds are measured by power output in kilowatts (kW), while battery capacity is measured in kilowatt hours (kWh). For example, a Nissan Leaf has 39kWh of battery capacity, while a Tesla Model Y has 60kWh.Recharge times vary depending on battery size: divide the battery size by the power to get a very rough idea of how many hours it will take to charge. (E.g., a 60kWh battery at a 22kW charger would take about three hours.) The quicker the charge, the more it tends to cost.Slow: up to 8kWCommon at homes, on-street chargers and places cars hang around like car parks or hotels. Suitable for charging overnight. Plugging in with a UK three-pin plug to the mains at home will deliver about 2.3kW – although it is not recommended.Fast: 8kW to 49kWFound at urban sites like supermarkets, shopping centres or car parks. Capable of charging a smaller battery in a few hours.Rapid: 50kW to 150kWTypically found close to big roads for journey charging, but also increasingly found in locations such as supermarkets or gyms with short dwell times. 50kW could give 80% charge in less than an hour.Ultra-rapid: 150kW and aboveMost chargers being installed at motorway services or dedicated charging hubs are now at least 150kW.  Many newer cars can now handle 150kW, and several can charge at speeds of over 300kW, adding hundreds of miles of range in around 10 minutes.Photograph: John Walton/PA WireWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Vicky Read, the chief executive of ChargeUK, a lobby group for the charging industry, said that there had been fewer installations than the industry wanted of slow chargers, which tend to be used to charge more cheaply overnight.“Across the market charge point operators have been facing rapidly rising costs, which has impacted the pace of the rollout in some more commercially challenging locations, while grid connections continue to hold back installations,” she said.Some analysts believe that the UK’s charger rollout is on track. The supply of public charging across Great Britain remains ahead of demand by 1.5 years, according to analysis in September byCenex, a non-profit research body. However, rapid chargers by motorways for longer journeys are much more developed: existing charge points could cope with demand for the next six years without any more added, Cenex said.Read said delayed local electric vehicle infrastructure (Levi) funding for councils would start arriving in bulk in 2026 and 2027, helping installations to accelerate again.She said: “To ensure we stay on track as we make this transition, we need to have the government’s support to reduce the cost burden – which is affecting driver prices as well as pace of rollout – and to remove the bottlenecks like connecting to the grid.”Electric car charger mapDespite the UK’s progress in charger installations, the regional variations remain large. Northern Ireland, the poorest region in the UK, has only 39 public chargers for each 100,000 people, compared with 301 for London, according to Zapmap data last updated in October. Northern Ireland, the East Midlands and north-east England were the slowest regions for charger installations per person in the year to October.Melanie Shufflebotham, the Zapmap chief operating officer, said there was still “strong growth in ultra-rapid charging”.“Charge point operators face challenges as the tender and commercial contract process for the Levi fund have taken longer than anticipated, and in parallel, there are also concerns in terms of accessing grid connections in a timely fashion,” she added.Explore more on these topicsElectric, hybrid and low-emission carsTechnology sectorMotoring (Technology)Automotive industryMotoring (Money)newsShareReuse this content"

She has applied to sit A-level exams as a private candidate in 2026, at a cost of £1,400.She told the Guardian that studying Russian was “against my personal principle because I was born [in Donetsk] where the war started in 2014. It’s not a language I want to speak or study because my father became a soldier last year”.She added: “I am truly grateful for the opportunity to study in the United Kingdom – it feels like my third home [afterUkraineand the Czech Republic, where she initially moved]. But not everyone realises how challenging it can be for Ukrainian students to adapt to a new education system, culture and language after everything our country has gone through.”Endeberia said she struggled on her A-level courses and felt she was being bullied because of her accent. She claims the college did not provide her with extra support but instead tried to persuade her to take up A-level Russian.“Rather than offering empathy or help, they continued to insist that I change subjects. No one tried to understand how painful this experience was for me,” she said.She said she had struggled to obtain “clear answers” about why she has been prevented from pursuing politics, economics and statistics, and is pursuing a complaints process through Potteries Educational Trust, which oversees SFC. She plans to escalate the case to Ofsted once this is completed.A spokesperson for City of Stoke-on-Trent Sixth Form College said: “The college cares deeply about our students and every effort is made to resolve issues and complaints in accordance with our complaints and resolution process. We do not comment on individuals for reasons of confidentiality.”Ukrainehas previously lobbiedthe UK government to give teenage refugees the chance to study a GCSE in Ukrainian, amid reports they are instead being pressed to study Russian because many can already speak some of the language.Ukraine’s education minister, Oksen Lisovyi, met the UK education secretary,Bridget Phillipson, in December 2024 to warn that being taught Russian could retraumatise about 27,000 displaced Ukrainian children in the UK who have fled Vladimir Putin’s invasion.The children’s commissioner, Rachel de Souza, has also urged the government to reintroduce a GCSE in Ukrainian.AQA has said it is considering developing a GCSE in the Ukrainian language, however it is understood that this could take a couple of years.Explore more on these topicsUkraineStoke-on-TrentHigher educationnewsShareReuse this content"

Our bank account has had no transactions to or from Palestine Action.“The government – Shabana Mahmood [the home secretary] but Yvette Cooper [her predecessor] started it – said that there’s nothing wrong with supporting Palestine but there’s everything wrong with supporting Palestine Action. Well, our bank account has not and our membership has not supported financially or otherwise Palestine Action. So it’s an absolute abuse for the implications of this ban to extend so widely that bank accounts of ordinary Palestinian supporting groups should be closed.”Nicholson, 71, also had his joint personal account with his partner, Norma Turner, 77, who is chair of GMFP,closed by Yorkshire Building Societywithout explanation in September.GMFP’s listed activities include “letter-writing, individual consumer boycotting, through bike-riding, information stalls, leafleting, and our increasing social media output”. It has held demonstrations in support of Palestine Action prisoners, including on 15 December, but it is not affiliated to the group.In a letter to Nicholson, Green said: “I can confirm my office was told by GMP that ‘we are comfortable to say that this account has been frozen as a result of an investigation into Palestine Action’.”At the same time the police force told Green’s office that it was not involved in the freezing of the account, raising the prospect that it was another law enforcement organisation carrying out the investigation. The National Crime Agency (NCA) declined to comment on any of the Guardian’s questions about bank account freezes. Counter-terrorism police did not respond.Even before the reason for GMFP’s account being frozen was known, the fact of the block – and that of Scottish Palestine Solidarity Campaign’s funds – was cited in therecent legal challengeto the ban on Palestine Action as an example of “fears and uncertainty over the meaning and effect of proscription, including on broader campaigning around Palestine”.Scottish PSC’s account with Unity Trust Bank, which promotes itself as the bank of choice for “socially minded organisations” was frozen on 24 June, the day afterCooper, then home secretary, announced plans to proscribe Palestine Action. After Scottish PSC told the bank that its website had previously included a payment link for donations to Palestine Action (before it was proscribed) the block on the accout was lifted before being reimposed two days later. It remains frozen with thousands of pounds inaccessible.Hussein Ezzedine,a trade union officer at Scottish PSC , attended a meeting with Unity Trust Bank where he said it confirmed the block was imposed by the NCA. “I think it’s important that people are aware, we’re peaceful activists and we’re under attack by the highest force for crime investigation in the country,” said Ezzedine. “It’s outrageous.”Explore more on these topicsGreater ManchesterProtestPalestineFreedom of speechScotlandActivismGazanewsShareReuse this content"

She was in the same predicament at Dickens’s mother, Elizabeth. Married to a navy clerk, John Dickens, “who liked the finer things in life and spent way beyond his means and so continuously plunged his family into debt”, she pawned possessions and endured moonlit flits with her brood of children to avoid debt collectors, said Parsons.View image in fullscreenCharles Dickens drew on many real women who made it on to the page only in diluted form.Photograph: DEA/G Nimatallah/De Agostini/Getty ImagesMrs Micawber is depicted as a doting mother who runs a dysfunctional household. Yet when Dickens wrote the character he was still very angry at his own mother for sending him out to work in a blacking factory, aged 12, to pay family debts while his sister Fanny was allowed to stay on at the Royal Academy of Music because her fees had been paid in advance.Both Mrs Micawber’s and Elizabeth’s money-making schemes included setting up unsuccessful schools for young ladies. He ridicules this attempt, writing with contempt in the novel: “I never found that any young lady had even been to school there; or that any young lady ever came, or proposed to come; or that the last preparation was ever made to receive any young lady.“The only visitors I ever saw, or heard of, were creditors,” he wrote of the Mrs Micawber Boarding Establishment for Young Ladies, in a thinly veiled description of his mother’s own efforts.View image in fullscreenAn etching of Tattycoram, who was modelled on Rhena Pollard, a hot-tempered resident of a rehabilitation home for women.Photograph: Lewis Bush/Dickens Museum“Yet Elizabeth did set him on his path to his writing career. She taught him to read and write and basic Latin. She got him his first writing job as a parliamentary reporter for the Mirror of Parliament, a paper run by her brother,” said Parsons.The saintly Little Nell, from The Old Curiosity Shop, is modelled on Mary Hogarth, the sister of Dickens’s wife, Catherine, who came to live with them at 48 Doughty Street inLondon– the site of the museum – where she died, aged 17, probably from a stroke. A devastated Dickens missed two publication deadlines, for The Pickwick Papers and Oliver Twist, and later channelled his grief into the character Nell Trent.View image in fullscreenAn etching of Little Nell, from The Old Curiosity Shop, modelled on Dickens’s sister-in-law Mary Hogarth, who died at 17.Photograph: Lewis Bush/Dickens Museum“He kind of creates an angel out of her,” said Parsons. In immortalising his version of Mary, he instructs that the illustration of Nell for The Old Curiosity Shop should “make her look more childish and her surroundings grimmer so she would look more frightened and helpless”.Yet research shows Hogarth to be a lively Victorian teenager with an interest in the world around her, whose intellect Dickens “very much respected”. She was far more than the “meek, mild and virtuous kind of womanly qualities that he was bringing through in Little Nell”, said Parsons.View image in fullscreenAngela Burdett-Coutts, Dickens’s friend and a banking heiress and philanthropist, is thought to be the model for Agnes Wickfield in David Copperfield.Photograph: Lewis Bush/Dickens MuseumIn Agnes Wickfield, the wise, shy, loyal friend in David Copperfield, researchers draw parallels with Dickens’s influential friend Angela Burdett-Coutts, a banking heiress and philanthropist with whom he set up Urania Cottage in Shepherd’s Bush, west London, a rehabilitation home for women released from prison, including sex workers, to equip them for new lives.Dickens’s representation of downtrodden women in his novels evolved significantly following his conversations with the women of Urania Cottage. While in Oliver Twist, pre-Urania Cottage, Nancy was desperately emotional, by the time of Little Dorrit the similarly discarded character Tattycoram was far more powerful and resourceful. The inspiration for Tattycoram was a hot-tempered Urania resident Rhena Pollard, who was 16 when she moved there after serving time in a workhouse and in prison.Despite this progression in his writing, Dickens still believed his readers would be unforgiving of unrepentant “imperfect” female characters; so just as he had ensured Nancy made amends by attempting to save Oliver, in David Copperfield Little Em’ly and Martha Endell turned away from “sin” and were rewarded with a new life, emigrating at the end of the novel, just like Urania Cottage residents.The exhibition, from 11 February to 6 September 2026, will also explore influential women beyond the page, including Catherine Dickens and the actor Ellen (Nelly) Ternan, best known today for having had a long relationship with Dickens – although the nature of that relationship is still the subject of debate.Explore more on these topicsCharles DickensWomenMuseumsExhibitionsLondonfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It used 53 influencers this year, compared with 26 in the previous one.The Home Office, Ministry of Justice, Ministry of Defence, and the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) were among the departments using the most paid-for social media influencers to promote their work since 2024.The government hasfaced criticism from journalists after sweeping changes to Downing Street’s press lobby system. Earlier this month, Tim Allan, Downing Street’s executive director of communications, said the number of daily lobby briefings would halve in the new year.Starmer’s communications chief to address cabinet on media strategy overhaulRead moreThe afternoon lobby briefing – in which journalists can ask as many questions as they want on any topic – is being cut entirely, and the morning meeting will sometimes be replaced by a press conference open to specialist journalists and social media content creators. The organisation representing lobby journalists said the move restricted access scrutiny.Personalities familiar to younger audiences are increasingly being courted by ministers. During the Cop30 climate summit in Brazil, the scientist Simon Clarkbroadcast his FaceTime callwith Starmer to his 73,000 followers on Instagram. The campaigner Anna Whitehouse – otherwise known as Mother Pukka – posted clips of her conversation withBridget Phillipsonabout the failings of the English childcare system to 444,000 followers in July, while the personal finance influencersCameron SmithandAbi Fosterwere given front-row seats at Rachel Reeves’s press conference warning of forthcoming tax rises.The DWP has spent £120,023 this year on eight influencers, having not employed any last year, on campaigns it said were to inform the public about policies and services and help available to vulnerable households.The Department for Business and Trade spent £39,700 in 2025 on social media influencers, having engaged a total of 17 this year and in 2024. They included Bella Roberts, Krish Kara, Noah Brierley, Rotimi Merriman-Johnson (Mr MoneyJar), Beth Fuller and Jasmine Shum.The Ministry of Justice has used 12 social media influencers since 2024, supporting recruitment campaigns to encourage people to apply for prison officers, probation officers and magistrate roles.The figures were released in response to requests under the Freedom of Information Act by a public relations agency, Tangerine, which said the government was scrambling for the attention of “young and apathetic voters”. Most departments refused to give information, citing “commercial reasons.”Sam Fisk, the associate director at Tangerine, said: “The public are craving authentic voices and increasingly turning off from watching ministers trumpet out pre-rehearsed political soundbites.“The government shouldn’t be sneered at for their use of influencers. This is a smart shift given the fall in TV viewership, however, the challenge is now delivering genuinely high-quality content. It won’t be easy to stop a gen Z scrolling for a government advert.”Downing Street views the influencer ecosystem as a useful way to reach audiences who rarely engage with traditional media. But to critics the model is a way of avoiding serious scrutiny of controversial policy in favour of softball questions from interviewers with little grasp of crunchy technical details.Keir Starmer earned moderate praise for his “borderline competent” TikToks after his account launched last week. The prime minister has also joined Substack, the newsletter platform, writing in his first post: “People have a right to know how decisions that affect them are taken and why.

In a video, police can be seen pushing the men to the ground and handcuffing them as bystanders watched.The Israeli police said in a statement that the man wearing the Santa Claus costume resisted arrest and assaulted an officer.The Mossawa Center, a rights groups that advocates for Palestinian citizens of Israel, said police used excess force on the men and that the raid on the music hall was done without legal authority.The arrests came as Palestinians celebrate Christmas across the occupied West Bank and Gaza amid continual restrictions on daily life by Israeli forces.Celebrations were held for the first time in Bethlehem since the war in Gaza started, with marching bands blowing bagpipes through the streets of the birthplace of Jesus. Worshippers attended mass at the church of nativity and children sang carols as the city lit up with celebrations.In war-torn Gaza, where more than 70,000 people have been killed and much of the infrastructure has been destroyed by Israeli bombs, a small Christian community celebrated its first Christmas since a shaky ceasefire began. Christmas trees and glitter brought splashes of colour to the rubble that is strewn across the Gaza strip.Israeli attacks continued despite the holiday. Israeli settlers uprooted olive groves in the town of Turmus Ayya, outside Ramallah, while Israeli soldiers stormed homes and confiscated vehicles near Hebron, according to the WAFA, the Palestinian news agency.Attacks by Israelis targeting Christians have been on the rise, with a March report documenting 32 attacks on church properties and 45 physical attacks targeting Christians.In his first Christmas address as pontiff, Pope Leo condemned the abysmal humanitarian situation in Gaza, where hundreds of thousands live in tents and substandard dwellings in the biting cold and rain. He referenced the story of Jesus being born in a stable, and said that it showed that God had “pitched his fragile tent” among the people of the world.“How, then, can we not think of the tents in Gaza, exposed for weeks to rain, wind and cold,” he said, lamenting “the defenceless populations, tried by so many wars”.Explore more on these topicsWorld newsnewsShareReuse this content"

The most peaceful place is the grave: there nobody protests,” says Dr Sima Samar.Samar has spent a lifetime working for the ideals of a country that no longer exists.The Hazara human rights advocate and medical doctor served as vice-president of Afghanistan, and as its minister for women, shortly after the US-led invasion began. For nearly 20 years, she led the country’s Independent Human Rights Commission (IHRC).Now in exile, she tells the Guardian she fears her country is being forgotten while the oppressive rule of the Taliban is normalised and solidified.Afghanistan’s historic Ariana cinema torn down by Taliban – in picturesRead moreConflicts around the world jostle for global attention: the genocide in Darfur; bombardment and starvation in Gaza; ceaseless, grinding conflict in Ukraine; terrorism in Bondi.“The international community has lost interest, has stopped paying attention,” Samar says. “There are conflicts all around the world, some very bad conflicts, but Afghanistan is also important … there is a moral responsibility to defend human rights everywhere.“What is security when a woman is not safe to walk in the street? What is security if a girl cannot go to school? What is security if families have food for lunch but no food for dinner. There’s no human security.”A long memory for conflictAfghanistan has a long memory – especially for conflict. Where the world might see the tumult of unprecedented events, Afghans see history repeating.Samar says the world’s current neglect of Afghanistan is akin to the indifference after the collapse of the Soviet-backed government in 1992. The country fell into brutal civil war, ended only by the first rise to power of the Taliban, providing a safe harbour from where Osama bin Laden plotted the 9/11 attacks.View image in fullscreenAs chair of the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission, Dr Sima Samar spent two decades documenting violations in the country.Photograph: Wakil Kohsar/AFP/Getty Images“We have seen the consequences of forgetting, of isolating Afghanistan in the past,” she says. “We know what happens, not only for Afghanistan, but for the world.”Visiting Australia, Samar spoke at Canberra’s Parliament House on 14 December, reflecting on taking carriage of a shell of a country in the aftermath of the ouster of the Taliban in 2001. She says a small band of democrats paled before the immensity of the task before them.Sign up: AU Breaking News email“We had to start from scratch: draft a new constitution, create ministries and rebuild institutions. I remember walking through Kabul’s shattered streets thinking that, if we could keep girls in school and women in the workplace, Afghanistan would never again fall to darkness.“Over the next 20 years, we tried.”There were wins. Samar’s foundation, the Shuhada Organisation, opened schools and hospitals in remote places that had never known either. The foundation trained midwives (Afghanistan has one of the highest infant and maternal mortality rates in the world), teachers and administrators to run rural provinces.As chair of the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission, Samar spent nearly two decades documenting violations and beseeching those in authority not to look away, as she puts it: “urging … the world to remember that justice must never be sacrificed for convenience”.View image in fullscreenSima Samar was awarded the 2012 Right Livelihood award, also known as the Alternative Nobel prize.Photograph: Johannes Eisele/AFP/Getty Images“There were moments of genuine progress,” Samar said in her speech. “Millions of girls returned to school. Women sat in parliament, ran ministries, and held prominent positions in civil society.”The gains were fragile always, and regression common, but, in individual lives, there was real change.And then, it was gone.Samar tells the Guardian it was devastating to see the collapse of an idea of a country to which so many had given so much.“We sacrificed a lot, all of us, but at the end we gave the country back to the same group which was removed in 2001.”For all its idealism and the billions in international support, that government was always brittle, riven by corruption and mismanagement, undermined by continued insurgent violence. Progress was always piecemeal, often compromised.View image in fullscreenSima Samar walks alongside Afghanistan health minister, Suhaila Siddiq, as part of a new interim government in 2001.Photograph: Marco Di Lauro/APIn August 2021, in the face of US withdrawal (a dealnegotiated between a first-term Donald Trump and the Taliban– without the elected government of Afghanistan in the room), the country changed with terrifying swiftness – Kabul fell in a single morning.The Taliban, which retook control, promised a reformed administration. In an attempt to court international legitimacy and recognition, it vowed there would be no discrimination against women, no persecution of religious or ethnic minorities, no retribution against those who had served the former government, or international forces. But always with the caveat of“within the frameworks that we have”.The reality has been, instead, a more sophisticated oppression, but conscious of presenting a more benign face in pursuit of international credibility.“Two decades later, we are again speaking of Afghanistan in the language of absence and erasure,” Samar told her Parliament House audience. “Erasure of women from the public; absence of protection for persecuted groups; and absence of justice.“Today, girls in Afghanistan are banned from secondary school. Universities are closed to women. Women cannot work for NGOs, visit parks, or travel without a male guardian. Women cannot even be heard in public. The word ‘apartheid’ is not an exaggeration; it is the lived reality for women and girls in Afghanistan.”Taliban arguments about modesty and protection, about governing “in accordance with our values” are self-serving falsehoods, Samar says, born of a narrow, suffocating vision of a country that has always known a breathtaking diversity of ethnicity, language and culture.Samar says tragedy lies, too, in international obeisance.“This is not about culture or religion; it is about power and control,” she says.“And it thrives in silence, including the silence of the international community, the fatigue of donors, and the complacency of governments who speak of human rights in press releases or places like Geneva and New York but whisper them away in negotiations.”Small acts of defianceSamar praises Australia for its acceptance, over decades, of Afghan refugees, particularly from the persecuted Hazara minority. She says the country can take more. And she says Australia’s efforts under the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) are vital in attempting to hold the Taliban accountable for its abuses.Samar urges Australia’s to maintain diplomatic recognition of the Afghanistan embassy in Canberra, which was credentialled by the former government, rather than handing diplomatic recognition to representatives of the Taliban. The foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, has warned the current ambassador (serving in exile) will not have his credential renewed in February.View image in fullscreenThe former Afghanistan vice-president, Sima Samar, speaks at an event in Canberra, Australia in December 2025.Photograph: Mozafar AliDozens of countries, including Germany and Norway, have credentialled Taliban diplomats, even without formally recognising its government. But retaining recognition of the former government’s envoys would carry a powerful message, Samar argues, not just for the Taliban, but the broader international community.In Afghanistan, Samar sees slivers of hope still. Small acts of defiance take on a disproportionate significance.“A teacher who continues to teach five or 10 girls in secret is a resistance against ignorance, a woman who comes out into the street, whose voice is heard, is a resistance against erasure,” she says.Homes destroyed, dreams surviveSamar has already rebuilt a country once. She knows a future rebuilding of Afghanistan will be the work of younger generations, but she hopes to glimpse the beginnings of that brighter, peaceful future.‘They fought for American values’: Afghan immigrants and advocates push back against Trump crackdownRead moreExiled since the fall of Kabul on that chaotic, fearful morning in August 2021, she would like, one day, to return.Like the country she worked for decades to build, the house where she was born in Ghazni, has been destroyed.“But I really do dream of it still. It is strange, because it is not there any more, but I dream of it,” she says.Still standing is Samar’s house in the capital, Kabul, a place she knows she may never see again. But to those who ask, she answers her home is in Afghanistan.“I am still very much an Afghan. I would love to return one day. I keep saying that I would like to die in my country.”Explore more on these topicsAustralia newsAfghanistanAustralian immigration and asylumfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The jackpot had a lump sum cash payment option of $834.9m.“Congratulations to the newest Powerball jackpot winner! This is truly an extraordinary, life-changing prize,” Matt Strawn, Powerball Product Group chair and Iowa Lottery CEO, was quoted as saying by the website. “We also want to thank all the players who joined in this jackpot streak – every ticket purchased helps support public programs and services across the country.”The prize followed 46 consecutive drawings in which no one matched all six numbers.The last drawing with a jackpot winner was on 6 September, when players in Missouri and Texas won $1.787bn.The last time someone won a Powerball jackpot on Christmas Eve was in 2011, Powerball said. The company added that the sweepstakes also has been won on Christmas Day four times, most recently in 2013.Powerball’s odds of 1 in 292.2m are designed to generate big jackpots, with prizes growing as they roll over when no one wins. Lottery officials note that the odds are far better for the game’s many smaller prizes.“With the prize so high, I just bought one kind of impulsively. Why not?” Indianapolis glass artist Chris Winters said on Wednesday.Tickets cost $2, and the game is offered in 45 states plus Washington DC, Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands.Explore more on these topicsArkansasNational lotterynewsShareReuse this content"

That included rebellions over issues such as excessive bonuses or salary increases for top earning bosses.However, the Treasury – under the chancellor, Rachel Reeves – instructed the Investment Association (IA), the UK asset management trade body that maintained the register,to shut it downthis autumn as part of a wider regulation action plan to increase economic growth by cutting “red tape” for businesses. The closure of the public log follows lobbyingcampaign by companies including the London Stock Exchange, whose bosses claim bad publicity over executive pay is harming the City’s competitiveness and deterring UK listings.However, theHigh Pay Centre, a thinktank, is warning the move will harm transparency and make it easier for companies listed on the FTSEAll-Share Indexto dismiss investors’ concerns, starting in the 2026 annual shareholder meetings season.“This is worrying, from our perspective,” Paddy Goffey, a researcher at the thinktank, said. “This would make it more likely that significant cases of shareholder dissent on issues of pay, governance and wider strategy will go unnoticed.”About 26% of FTSE 100 companies have had a shareholder rebellion against executive pay over the past three years. Dissent is considered a shareholder rebellion if 20% or more of the vote is against a specific resolution. “This reflects the significant levels of dissent within shareholder votes and how crucial such information is for investors and other stakeholders,” Goffey said.The High Pay Centre acknowledged corporate reporting rules could be burdensome and complex, and should be streamlined. However, that should not include discontinuing tools such as the register that provided genuine value to stakeholders, the thinktank said. The closure added to other “worrying trends” around corporate transparency such as the shift to online-only AGMs.Rather than closing the register, companies should be forced to provide more detailed explanations about the reason for shareholder dissent and how their boards planned to respond in the future, the High Pay Centre said.“Ultimately, discontinuing the register will make it much harder and more time-consuming to gather the relevant data and information, as such data could be ‘buried’ in complex filings, AGM results or lengthy reports,” it added.The decision illustrates the significant cultural shift that has taken place across the City since the May government launched the world’s first public log of dissenting shareholder votes in order to “restore public confidence in big business”.“It [the register] definitely had a role in holding companies to account in the early years, especially on remuneration, and for a while companies truly did worry about the prospect of being named on the register,” said Yousif Ebeed, the corporate governance lead at the assent managers Schroders.“And at the time, there was a sense that companies were not giving sufficient weight to shareholder concerns. The register helped shine a light on these companies, to an extent kickstarting an environment where transparency and shareholder engagement have become embedded practice.”Fast forward to 2025, and City campaigners are raising fears that the UK is losing out on investment to the US, where Donald Trump has embarked on a “bonfire of regulation” in an attempt to lure money and business.The UK Treasury said in October tit was “grateful to the IA for establishing the register following a request from government” but that the public log had “served its purpose”. The Treasury added that the corporate governance code “already offered transparency for investors”.Ebeed said most institutional investors would remain “unaffected”.However, at a time when the government is pushing for more of the public to buy up UK shares, there is a fear that small retail investors could be left at a disadvantage.“The reduction in transparency and knowledge on company practice could reduce the ability of investors to make informed decisions,” Goffey said.“Having all this data in one place also makes it easier to track discontent, identify trends and compare companies or sectors. It is plausible that, with the raising of the barrier to holding companies accountable in this way, they [companies] will be less likely to take such dissent seriously and respond appropriately.”Explore more on these topicsExecutive pay and bonusesCorporate governanceRachel ReevesFinancial sectorEconomic policynewsShareReuse this content"

Or if you’re young enough, you might not remember them at all. But now it seems lava lamps are back.Rising sales would suggest a third wave of the lava lamp phenomenon is on the horizon, thanks to the ongoing trend towards mid-century interiors and gen Z’s fascination with the late 90s and early 2000s.Cressida Granger, the managing director of theBritish lava lamp pioneers Mathmos, said there had been a surge in interest in its lamps. “It feels like they’re in the current conversation in a way they haven’t been.”Sales have been rising steadily in recent years and 2025 is set to be a huge festive season. Mathmos has oversold in the run-up to Christmas, which means the company will be short of stock come January.So what does Granger put this appeal down to? “They’re sort of nostalgic, aren’t they? So that’s comforting when the world’s changing,” she said.“They are just very calming, they’re very analogue. They take two hours to warm up. They don’t demand anything of you, they’re very soothing. People use them for mindfulness and focus.View image in fullscreenEdward Craven Walker, the founder of Mathmos, with several of his creations, including the Astro lamp, which was later named the lava lamp.Photograph: Ian Cook/Getty Images“[In the case of Mathmos], people really like that we’re the real thing and they’ve always been made here and we invented them. So that feels also secure and authentic, and we really work hard to make them the best.”Mathmos was founded in 1963, by the inventor of the lava lamp, Edward Craven Walker.Walker was an eccentric, a nudist who was married four times before his death at the age of 82 in 2000. He was responsible for the early success of the company, which was then called Crestworth, with his wife Christine, but when sales collapsed in the 1980s, his successor Granger oversaw the renaissance.Formerly a vintage dealer, Granger initially approached Walker to buy the formula but ended up taking over the business in 1989.Though much about Mathmos has changed, the secret recipe is still loosely based on Walker’s designs and the bottles are still filled by hand.The factory, at Poole inDorset, bears all the quirks expected of somewhere making such an unusual product.Upstairs, customer service staff speak multiple languages to engage with customers from its 10 international websites. Downstairs, a mesmerising showroom of lava lamps of different colours and designs enraptures anyone who enters.Adjacent to that is where the magic happens, where the bottles are filled and the lava lamps are assembled – sometimes even personalised – and boxed, ready to be shipped in time for Christmas.View image in fullscreenMathmos’s director, Cressida Granger, holds an uncapped lava lamp bottle containing a coloured wax and water-based liquid mixture at the factory.Photograph: Peter Flude/The GuardianThe original model, the Astro with the classic lava lamp shape, is still the bestseller but others such as the rocket-shaped 90s Telstar are popular, and a number of newer models including ones lit by candles have also proved a success.“I suppose it is unusual to have a job that no one else really has in Europe,” says Alan Staton, the only person outside China who spends his working day putting the lava into the lamps.The “lava” is essentially a type of brightly coloured wax suspended in water, which is heated by a bulb and rises to the top, falling again when it cools, creating its characteristic hypnotic effect.Customers who bought a Mathmos lamp anytime in the last 30 years will have a product that was filled by Staton.His younger colleague Henry Currer has only worked at the factory for a few months – “I’m getting my head round it I think!” – having come from running a bronze casting factory in Birmingham. “What enticed me to it is that it’s a British heritage brand, something that’s made here,” he says.“Every other lava lamp’s made in China,” says Granger. There have been periods where innovative products were copied which devastated sales, and the small company did not have the funds for legal action. But Granger has a philosophical view: “If you’re not being copied you’re not doing anything successful.View image in fullscreenLava lamps on display at the Mathmos factory.Photograph: Peter Flude/The Guardian“We did a silicon ball that squeezed on and off, called Bubble, that got copied by Target in America. You can’t do a lot against Target.“But actually I spent a long time looking for the new lava lamp,” she says, “before I realised that the new lava lamp was the lava lamp.”The company has collaborated with various designers and artists, including the photographer Rankin, the band Duran Duran and the dutch designer Sabine Marcelis.Every one of these has sold out within hours, including most recently a limited edition red Rolling Stones collaboration, for which only 1,000 were made, which led to a huge queue at the band’s Carnaby Street store on the day it was released in November.“They were going for more money than people bought them for during the time we were selling them,” says Granger.Perhaps surprisingly, Mathmos’s customers are not one-offs. “They’ve often got more than one and they often gift them. We’ve got quite a big collecting community and they’re quite active. We do have some collectors who’ve got hundreds.”She says: “It’s like a vinyl record, you have to take it out of its sleeve and there’s a ceremony to it, which is kind of nice.”Explore more on these topicsManufacturing sectorRetail industryCollectingInteriorsConsumer spendingDorsetfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He said he is not looking forward to this year.”In the past, thieves have targeted copper cables, steel and piping. However, they are increasingly going after tools and equipment, which industry representatives believe signals the involvement of organised criminal groups.“They have the ability to get this equipment started, they know how to drive it,” said Worsley. “To move big plant equipment on, you have to know what you are doing.”The Chartered Institute of Building (CIOB) is calling for greater deterrents for thieves. A bill proposingharsher sentences for those convictedof tool theft is making its way through parliament.“Many small- and medium-sized enterprises are already feeling the burden of increased costs and chasing payments, so the cost of having to replace their tools can be difficult to bear at any time, least of all Christmas,” said David Barnes, the head of policy and public affairs at the CIOB.Security companies say good lighting may deter some thieves, while they also advise that construction firms group containers or storage units in one area in the centre of a site away from fences, to allow better monitoring.Explore more on these topicsConstruction industryCrimenewsShareReuse this content"

It took director and writerMichael Mannjust five weeks to adapt Thomas Harris’s novel Red Dragon for the screen.But when it came to adapting his own work – Heat 2, co-authored withMeg Gardineras both a prequel and sequel to his 1995 film Heat – Mann discovered the pain of self-editing. “I thought OK, 10 weeks, 12 weeks,” he reflects in a Zoom interview from Los Angeles. “Instead, it took like 10 months and it was arduous because I wanted the same effect as the novel, which required recombining events to fit within a two-and-a-half-hour timeframe. That selection became agonising to say the least.”Heat at 30: Michael Mann’s electric crime thriller is a film of fire and sadnessRead moreAccording tomedia reports, Heat 2 will have a $150m budget after moving from Warner Bros to United Artists with a cast rumoured to include Christian Bale and Leonardo DiCaprio. Mann remains both tight-lipped and cautious. “Listen, no picture happens until it’s happening, but right now we’re looking to start August 3,” he says.For Heat devotees, it has been a long wait. When the three-hour crime epic was released30 years ago this month, the film industry was in different place. Blockbuster Video ruled the roost, Netflix did not exist, CGI was expensive and rare while AI was mostly the realm of science fiction. The big hits at the box office were Toy Story, Apollo 13, Die Hard With a Vengeance and GoldenEye.Notably, a report about Heat 2 onDeadline stated: “Filming in California for 77 days, Mann’s movie has projected it will hire 40 main cast members, 800 ‘base crew members’ and 1,350 background actors (not a lot of AI there).”It was a small but telling reminder that Mann is a Hollywood artisan, a traditionalist who graduated from the London Film School in 1967 and whose work contains a kinetic authenticity. But now AI is on the march, capable of generating convincing video. It was a bone of contention during a historic labour dispute in 2023 thatachieved some AI protections, though some artists were unhappy with the deal.View image in fullscreenAl Pacino in Heat.Photograph: Warner Bros./AllstarMann comments: “Everybody’s very concerned and interested in what’s possible with AI, from a very cautionary perspective among the Screen Actors Guild, Writers Guild and Directors Guild because it may turn into a new kind of performance.“Well, that performance has to be acted by an actor, written by a writer, and directed by a director regardless of whether the execution is from artificial generative intelligence or not. The other thing is that at the same time one observes that technology never goes backward. Then there’s issues of copyright ownership in which the studios are pretty much aligned with the creators like myself and other writers and actors and directors.”Recent upheavals have seenDisney buy fellow studio 21st Century Fox,Paramount merge with Skydance Mediaand, most recently, the streaming giant Netflix agree to buyWarner Bros in an $83bn dealthat still faces various obstacles, including a hostile takeover bid from Paramount. Some observers fear that victory for Netflix would result in fewer films gaining a theatrical release.“Unless someone has a crystal ball, there’s no way to know the outcome,” says Mann, “I know what I’d like the outcome to be but I’m hardly in the inner circle. I know [Netflix CEO] Ted Sarandos but I don’t know their thinking.“A more relevant question from an audience perspective is: what’s the inherent logic? The inherent logic is that, when you have a film like the new Avatar with Imax presentation or great Dolby laser with a fantastic sound system, people will come, they will flock to it. Is the pattern three years from now that the exhibition relies on becoming even more experiential, similar to concert venues?”Mann is a creature of cinema who has described Stanley Kubrick’sDr Strangeloveas a formative influence on his career. “I make films for a large presentation,” he adds.“My ambition is to very strongly and effectively impact the audience with the story with all the tools at my disposal to transport them into this world for two, two and a half hours. That’s what I’ve always wanted to do since I was in film school in London and so it’s a diminution for any of my – or any number of other directors I can think of – to have our films be seen 16-by-9 on an iPhone. The full power of performance and expression is what I make films for.”Heat, released on 15 December 1995, is a case in point. Set in Los Angeles, the film follows the parallel lives of a master thief, Neil McCauley, and a dogged detective, Lt Vincent Hanna, whose private life is equally dysfunctional.A key reason it has endured is the casting of Robert De Niro and Al Pacino as the opposite and equal protagonists. Mann recalls the idea came up over breakfast with his co-producerArt Linson. “I said, ‘Let’s think about who would be in it’; we said, ‘What about Bob, what about Al?’“It was an automatic ‘it’s a fantastic idea’. I mean, the two greatest actors of their generation! The intensity, the internal power that De Niro has and the exuberance, the ability for performance with which Al could imbue a character, because within the character of Hanna, there’s a certain burlesque he uses with informants to keep them off balance, because in real life all informants lie some of the time. So it’s a constant game to manage an informant, to keep him off balance, to get the information you want.”The cast also includes Val Kilmer, Jon Voight, Amy Brenneman, Ashley Judd and Diane Venora. Heat’s plot is based on the experiences ofChuck Adamson, a celebrated Chicago detective who hunted and eventually killed the real lifeNeil McCauley, a career criminal who had served eight years on the prison island of Alcatraz. Adamson became a friend and consultant to Mann.The director recalls: “He had great respect and regard for McCauley professionally. If you’re the kind of driven detective that Adamson was, it’s like being a rock climber and your aspiration is to free climb Half Dome. So the better the crew you’re working, the bigger the challenge.“He had a high regard for McCauley’s professionalism but also there was a certain discovered rapport between them because it was as if McCauley viewed aspects of life and how he modulated himself similarly to Adamson.“They were both supremely self-aware, disciplined, fully conscious people, nearly devoid of self-deception. At the same time, in an encounter, each would blow the other out of his socks without thinking twice about it. That was the attitude.”In 1963, Adamson spotted McCauley at a Chicago deli. Instead of arresting him, he invited him for coffee. Much of the dialogue in the film’s pivotal scene was taken directly from Adamson’s recollection of that meeting. Both men acknowledged they were professionals on opposite sides and that if they met again “around the corner”, they would have to kill each other.View image in fullscreenMichael Mann in 2023.Photograph: Matt Licari/Invision/APHeat’s dramatisation of that meeting in a diner marked the first time that De Niro and Pacino were together on screen, despite both being in The Godfather Part II but in separate time periods. They did notrehearse the scene,a decision made at De Niro’s suggestion to keep the tension genuinely fresh.Mann recalls: “That’s the pivotal moment, the nexus of the drama – and we all knew it. We discussed the scene, analysed the scene, even maybe paraphrased it a little in gentle discussion because we wanted complete understanding of the multiplicity of motivations behind each character’s wanting to observe each other, take in each other. Both characters knew that they’re subconsciously getting an intuitive sense of the opposite number because they’re likely to be in a confrontation.“Both have lethal intent. What they don’t expect but do discover is the rapport when they start talking about their private lives and Hanna talks about a dream he has of dead bodies sitting around the table staring at him with eight-ball haemorrhages from gunshot wounds. Then De Niro asks: ‘What do they say?’ Al says, ‘Nothing.’ They don’t talk.“Then De Niro expresses a dream about drowning, which basically translates into: does he have enough time for what he wants in life? It becomes very intimate – the intimacy of strangers. You don’t want to rehearse a scene like that. Everybody understands that the magic of one or two unique takes will happen and we all want that to happen spontaneously on camera, not in a rehearsal.”Another indelible scene is a downtown shootout with a gritty, visceral quality that AI would struggle to replicate. McCauley’s gang successfully rob a bank but have been betrayed and are ambushed. Facing massed ranks of police, they try to shoot their way out.Mann hired former SAS operativesAndy McNaband Mick Gould to train the cast in realistic firearms handling. “We blocked out here’s how this ambush would happen and here’s how they would react and assault it.“When I found the location in downtown LA, I blocked the choreography across two city blocks. They’re leapfrogging: one guy’s laying down rounds while the other is moving forward and, then, he lays down rounds, et cetera, and it keeps going. We trained at the LA county sheriff’s shooting ranges under appropriately rigid safety procedures and sheriff’s range masters.“The guys trained three days a week, mornings, for months to get that good. They could probably outshoot 95% of the [Los Angeles police department]. You discover very quickly as a director that actors have tremendous eye-hand coordination and a learning curve that’s like a hockey stick.”He adds: “For the actors, they were living it and were using full-load blanks during the filming, which reverberated off the glass walls of the urban canyons we were in. The initial sound of the rehearsals was so frightening that I threw maybe 10, 11 mics around the location and so we wound up using the sound recorded during the filming.“Traditionally the sound effects designer would build 60–70 tracks and you’d post-produce during three days of pre-dubbing the sound effects. I had an excellent sound designer,Lon Bender, but I discarded most of it and basically used the sound from the dailies.”View image in fullscreenAl Pacino and Robert De Niro in Heat.Photograph: Ronald GrantHeat ends with Hanna chasing McCauley to a vast, open field adjacent to the Los Angeles international airport runways. The setting is dark and industrial but periodically flooded with blinding light from passing planes and strobing runway markers. The two men play a high-stakes game of hide-and-seek among massive shipping containers and electrical boxes.Mann recalls: “I wanted to leave the audience in a kind of – to use a music analogy – fugue state because you empathise with McCauley and want him to get away with [his girlfriend] Eady. Then with Hanna you’re empathetic to his pursuit of McCauley. There’s no compromise between the two states. I worked to have both there at 100% in what is fated to be a lethal confrontation between the two from which only one would survive.”As a plane approaches for landing, the landing lights illuminate the field. McCauley prepares to ambush Hanna but, as he moves, the shifting lights cast his shadow on the ground in front of him. Hanna spots the shadow, whips around and fires first, killing McCauley.“Then there’s the grace note where Hanna holds his hand, recalling the parallel between them, almost as if McCauley is fortunate to ride into death in tactical contact with one of the only other people on the planet who understands him. That counterpoint is how I wanted to leave it and that tends to sustain in memory.”Explore more on these topicsMichael MannAl PacinoRobert De NiroAction and adventure filmsThrillersCrime filmsinterviewsShareReuse this content"

As a new rash of reissues arrives, 80s stalwarts Lip Cream, Death Side and the Nurse recall the thrills and threatsAlex DellerThu 25 Dec 2025 06.00 ESTShareAfew short years after punk’s initial shock-and-awe inspired thousands of teenagers to spike their hair and learn three chords, the genre mutated into hardcore: a leaner, meaner and fiercely independent hybrid that would soon be tearing up squats, church halls and dive bars around the world.Forty-five years on,hardcore is enjoying a momentin the mainstream thanks to bands such as Turnstile, Speed and Knocked Loose. There are hardcore bands on talkshows, in fast-food ads and on $40 T-shirts – all things that the 1980s artists would probably have gobbed at.Anyone longing for hardcore’s original underdog spirit may be minded to look toJapan, and a range of newly reissued albums that document the early hardcore scene there. “It was extremely violent and frightening,” says Ishiya, frontman of the band Death Side, one of Japanese hardcore’s linchpin acts (he and many of his punk peers reject surnames or use stage names). “At every gig, someone would be beaten bloody, and you never knew when it might be your turn. That tension was something you could never experience in ordinary life – it was thrilling.”Tokyo alone was home to a huge array of foundational acts such as GISM, Gauze, the Comes and the Execute – and later Death Side, Bastard and Tetsu Arrey – all playing some of the most furious, exciting punk of the late 1980s and early 90s. But for all the sense of camaraderie the bands found on stage, on tour and in the sweaty, volatile crowds, being a punk in Japan could nevertheless be isolating.“Our basic stance was to rebel against society and ‘common sense’, so of course we chose a look that mainstream society wouldn’t accept,” says Ishiya, who used to sport a towering magenta mohawk. “In Japan, the pressure to conform is extremely strong, and we were subjected to discriminatory treatment just for looking different. On trains people avoided us, and when we looked for work, we were screened out. We were treated like enemies of society.”View image in fullscreen‘Pressure to conform is extremely strong’ … Punks in Osaka in the sumner of 1985.Photograph: Corbis/VCG/Getty ImagesOne of the earliest bands on the scene was Lip Cream. Bassist Minoru Ogawa used to hang out at the Japanese record store chain UK Edison “digging through the few hardcore records they had” and asking staff for recommendations, eventually alighting on western hardcore originators such as Discharge, Chaos UK, Dead Kennedys and Disorder: “I was always looking for fast rhythms.”He had already cut his teeth with the Comes, a raw, scything punk act whose enigmatic singer Chitose had been inspired by the Damned and the Stranglers, who he saw on a trip to London. Ogawa quit, but was then asked whether the Comes might provide tracks for a compilation LP. “I just made something up on the spot: ‘We’ll do it! We’ve actually got a new band!’ I randomly said: ‘We’re called Lip Cream.’”To make good on his word, Ogawa drafted in Aburadako drummer Maru and ex-Comes guitarist Naoki, and the band eventually released four albums containing some of the era’s most scintillatingly out-of-control thrash. “Everything I’d experienced in the Comes ended up turning into this stronger drive with Lip Cream,” says Ogawa. “It wasn’t that I wanted to changewhatI did – I just wanted to keep moving.”Listen to Lip Cream: SinElsewhere, a shorter-lived act called the Nurse were also making their mark as one of the world’s first all-female hardcore bands. Aged 16, singer Neko – a fan of GBH and Discharge – recruited members through Doll, a Japanese magazine. “My family was against me playing punk music,” she says, and they were surprised when she would leave the house “wearing heavy, eccentric makeup and strange fashion. I’d go to gigs at Tsubaki House in Shinjuku, and it caused problems when I’d stay out late.”In this first rush of Tokyo noise, Ishiya’s band Death Side released two landmark albums, a split release with Ishiya’s idols Chaos UK and a scattering of EPs, all between 1987 and 1994. “It was the feeling of: ‘I want to do something myself.’ A punk band was something anyone could do,” he says. “I got an instrument cheaply and practised, couldn’t manage it, and decided to be the vocalist. Hardcore punk was perfect for expressing the hopeless anger of my teenage years.”View image in fullscreenLip Cream on stage in 1984.Photograph: © Dynamite RecordsIshiya has a number of theories about why violence was so prevalent on the scene, ranging from a traditional samurai worldview to the country’s post-second world war trauma. Other reasons are more prosaic. “Basically, people who couldn’t fit into this thing called society – school, companies and so on – were all labelled delinquents,” he says. “When those kinds of people gather together, I think violence naturally breaks out.”This inclination was then magnified by bands such as GISM, whose frontman Sakevi had form for attacking journalists and wielding a flamethrower on stage. “Because of GISM’s violent performances there was a sense that hardcore gigshadto be violent,” says Ishiya. “It made gigs a kind of extraterritorial space where ordinary rules didn’t apply.”All these people seemed crazy, so I thought I’d be a crazy person tooThe problems came when the punks stepped back into regular society. Zigyaku, guitarist of the bluntly named Bastard, was shut out of venues and jobs, and unable to rent a room because of his appearance. He had played with Gudon and Half Years in Hiroshima before moving to Tokyo, where he instantly became enamoured of the city’s chaotic pace. “The first thing I felt was that everyone was just flying,” he laughs. “All these people seemed crazy, so I thought I’d be a crazy person too. There were so many hardcore bands; there were gigs all over the place every week. Time passed so quickly. It was like Ryūgū-jō in Japanese folklore” – a tale where the story’s hero visits the dragon god Ryūjin’s temple for what appears to be a few days, only to return home to find that centuries have passed.View image in fullscreen‘At every gig, someone would be beaten bloody’ … Death Side.Photograph: Courtesy: La Vida Es Un MusBut as well as his day-to-day difficulties, there were others as Bastard bulldozed their way across the country, incinerating audiences with the gristly, invincible-sounding hardcore they perfected on their 1992 album, Wind of Pain. “Bastard was never a violent band, but we still had a lot of trouble,” he says. “Punks are conspicuous, so they are easily noticed by the police and yakuza gangsters. On Bastard’s tour with Cruck, Mad Conflux and Pile Driver, there were troubles in every city.” Nevertheless, like Ishiya, Zigyaku apparently wouldn’t have it any other way. “Being a punk makes you a minority, and there’s value in that,” he says. “If more than half of Japan’s population became punk, I think it would be a more disgusting world!”Go hard or go home: why is hardcore punk enjoying a renaissance?Read moreFor all their close proximity, each of these bands maintained a distinct sound and identity. “There was a sense of rivalry but I think it was more like sharpening one another,” says Ishiya, who is now an author and punk historian. “It was a wonderful relationship where we would collide head-on and raise each other up.” This wild individualism was reflected elsewhere in Japan, with bands such as Confuse, Disclose, SOB, Mobs, Crow and Nightmare all twisting hardcore into strange, aberrant shapes.As towhythese bands were so original, most of the players offer little more than a shrug by way of response. Ishiya, however, finds a specific reason. “The musical lineage differs from that of overseas,” he suggests. “Abroad, rock plays in ordinary households, but in Japan in the 60s or 70s such a thing was unthinkable.” He highlights how Japanese music is instead rooted in gentle forms such as geinō kayōkyoku, enka and folk – meaning that punk was always going to burn even brighter in Japan. “If one rebels, one will likely move in a unique direction.”Lip Cream’s full back catalogue is available via Relapse Records.

The production expertly toyed with audience expectations, weaponising the very genre tropes that fans have come to anticipate. Ultimately, the show’s genius lay in its finale. Rather than a grim twist, the doors of No 9 closed with a defiant, glitzy Hollywood musical high-kicking routine. A joyous, unexpected celebration of showbiz cementing the production’s status as a triumph of meta-theatre.Phil Dukes, 56, BrightonRohtkoBarbican, LondonI went into Łukasz Twarkowski’s Rohtko unsure about the four-hour commitment, but it ultimately left me astonished. The production’s constantly shifting, ingeniously constructed sets and inventive live-filming techniques were unlike anything I’ve seen on stage.

It was extra special to share the experience with my mum, who has been going to see the WNO since the early 80s.Beth Charles, 52, SalfordThe Brightening AirOld Vic, LondonA great experience: the actors were incredibly good and the play was so intriguing that it had me on the edge of my seat. The dialogues were witty and suspenseful and some surprises in the plot got me thinking. But above all, I found the characters and their interaction really moving. The ending, where Billy came back to what she had said at the beginning, was touching too.Monika Diwo, GermanyView image in fullscreenDeserved to go much further … Small Acts of Love at the Citizens, Glasgow.Photograph: Jane Hobson/ShutterstockHamlet Hail to the ThiefRoyal Shakespeare theatre, Stratford-upon-AvonI don’t usually make the trip to the RSC, but as a massive fan of Radiohead I felt I had to see this version. I thought it was fantastic, perfectly integrating the angsty music with the themes of the play, often leaving me speechless. To take such a well-known story and make it feel so exciting and overwhelming (in a good way!) was a very pleasant surprise.Marko Blanusa, BracknellThe Fifth Step@sohoplace, LondonA stunning script perfectly acted by Jack Lowden and Martin Freeman. There was a tremendous chemistry between the two actors. I also thought the use of the stage was brilliant. It seems that every seat has a great vantage point so for me the theatre is 10/10 too.Alison Stapley, 68, LondonThe best theatre, comedy and dance of 2025Read moreBorn With TeethWyndham’s theatre, LondonThis was a thrilling fictionalisation of the relationship between Shakespeare and Marlowe, and although at its heart it was a gritty drama about spying and political intrigue in Elizabethan England, there was also a lot of humour and literary wordplay and a surprising amount of raunchiness. Framing Shakespeare as the shy, sensitive flower to Marlowe’s man-about-town worked strikingly well.Caitlin Farrell, 24, LondonSmall Acts of LoveCitizens theatre, GlasgowSmall Acts of Love at the stunningly restored and reopened Citizens theatre in Glasgow reduced this 63-year-old bloke to a blubbering wreck.

Ahead of this year’s offering of The Scarecrows’ Wedding, we ask: which is the all-time Christmas cracker?Michael HoganThu 25 Dec 2025 04.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 25 Dec 2025 04.02 ESTShareThey’re now as much a part of the Christmas Day schedules as the monarch’s boring speech and a bafflingly popular Mrs Brown’s Boys special. Animated adaptations of the picture books by authorJulia Donaldsonand illustrator Axel Scheffler have become a feelgood seasonal institution.It’s a cosy tradition that began with The Gruffalo in 2009 and has since become a festive fixture, taking pride of place on BBC One on Christmas afternoon. The voice casts are always impressively A-list, with Rob Brydon the only constant. This year’s kid-calmer is The Scarecrows’ Wedding, making it 13 entries in the canon and counting. But which is the all-time Christmas cracker? We’ve ranked them all from worst to best …13.The Smeds and the Smoos(2022)View image in fullscreenA snooze more like … The Smeds and the Smoos.Photograph: BBC/Magic Light PicturesWe know what we want from a Julia Donaldson creation: cute animals, magical settings and heartwarming bedtime stories with a gentle moral. What we don’t particularly want is a Romeo and Juliet-esque romance between a pair of different-coloured aliens from feuding families. Especially not ones told in sub-BFG nonsense language. The Smeds and the Snooze, more like.12.The Highway Rat(2017)A sweet-toothed rodent becomes a masked bandit and steals sugary treats but ultimately gets his comeuppance. Despite David Tennant voicing the peckish pest, this is Poundstretcher Pixar. The flirtatious rabbit is a weird flourish, like the makers are reliving their childhood crush on the Cadbury’s Caramel bunny. Besides, the buck-toothed rat looks more like a beaver. Ahem.11.Zog and the Flying Doctors(2020)This subpar sequel to the superior Zog sees the clumsy orange dragon and decidedly non-dashing knight Sir Gadabout try to rescue an ambitious princess who’s been locked up in her dastardly uncle’s castle. As a feminist riff on fairytales, it lacked plot twists and felt like reheated festive leftovers. Daniel Ings replaces Kit Harington as Gadabout, while Mark Bonnar pops up as Distressed Unicorn. Maybe the mythical creature foresaw his performance on The Celebrity Traitors.10.Tabby McTat(2023)This mini-drama about a busker and his singing cat is a rare Donaldson story to be set in London, rather than the bucolic countryside. Jodie Whittaker narrates, while Sope Dirisu and Susan Wokoma are adorable as the lovestruck felines. However, the twee capital city is somewhat Richard Curtis-fied from the book.9.Tiddler(2024)Last year’s offering is basically Finding Nemo with tartare sauce and a wedge of lemon. A sub-aqua saga follows a little fish with a big imagination who is forever spinning tall tales to excuse his lateness for sea school. When Tiddler gets lost in the wide open ocean, he’s saved by his own storytelling. Stunning underwater sequences, plus some knowing cameos, but it’s a predictable piscine yarn. Might also make grownup viewers feel guilty about that fish course during Christmas lunch.8.Superworm(2021)“See him wriggle! See him squirm! Hip hip hooray for Superworm!” A heroic tale about a long, strong annelid who keeps saving the day. Well, until he gets a bit full of himself, starts ignoring his friends and is captured by the evil Wizard Lizard. The cutesy anthropomorphism – earthworms don’t have eyes, guys! – is soon forgiven, thanks to narration from Oscar-winner Olivia Colman and Matt Smith as our slithery hero.7.The Scarecrows’ Wedding(2025)This year’s entry in the Christmas canon is a Worzel Gummidge-adjacent affair about two besotted turnip-heads planning their nuptials. That is, until a smooth-talking love rival puts them in mortal danger. Jessie Buckley and Domhnall Gleeson are charming as the straw-stuffed fiances, while Sophie Okonedo narrates. Small complaint: a crab randomly turns up on a farm that’s clearly inland. Sure, it’s not a wildlife documentary but give us some credit. We might be merry and slumped in a carb coma but we’re not daft.6.The Gruffalo’s Child(2011)This sequel sees the Gruffalo’s wilful daughter ignore her father’s warnings and venture into the deep dark wood in search of the fabled Big Bad Mouse. A neat reversal of the original’s plot, with a worthy message about conquering your fears and heeding parental advice. It loses points by being a little too cynically cute, not to mention its plot twist defying the laws of physics. It regains them for its snowy setting and gorgeously atmospheric glow.5.Zog(2018)View image in fullscreenThe OG … Zog, the dragon who must learn to fly.Photograph: BBCNot to be confused with Irish puppet twins Zig and Zag from the planet Zog. This is the scaly story of a keen pupil at Dragon School, desperate to learn how to fly, roar and breathe fire. If only he weren’t so accident-prone. When Zog makes friends with Princess Pearl, who dreams of being a doctor when she grows up, he discovers his true purpose. Slyly funny, subversive and full of subtle details, with a voice cast including Lenny Henry, Tracey Ullman, Kit Harington (riffing on his Game of Thrones persona) and scene-stealer Patsy Ferran. Puts the “OG” into Zog.4.The Snail and the Whale(2019)A plucky sea snail befriends a gentle humpback whale and rides his tail fin on an adventure around the world. Who hasn’t dreamed of that? An enchanting story of unlikely friendship with genuine jeopardy and an air punch-inducing rescue. Winningly narrated by Diana Rigg, and visually beautiful, it features Blue Planet-worthy sequences, while delivering watery wisdom about empathy and environmental awareness. Blubbery in both senses.3.Room on the Broom(2012)This stone-cold classic sees a kindly witch invite an array of animals to hop on to her broomstick, much to the annoyance of her jealous cat. A spellbinding ode to friendship, family and inclusivity. The scenes where they all whoosh off into the sky are surprisingly exhilarating. A classy voice cast includes Gillian Anderson, Sally Hawkins, Simon Pegg and Timothy Spall. No wonder it nabbed an Oscar nomination. Wallace and Gromit vibes. Compliments don’t come much higher.2.Stick Man(2015)Another total banger with a true Christmas edge, hence its high placing. This Homeric epic follows a happy-go-lucky father’s quest to make it back to his “family tree” in time for Christmas. Martin Freeman brings soul to the wooden stick, while Hugh Bonneville voices Santa and Jennifer Saunders narrates. The climactic scene on a sleigh is downright spine-tingling. You’ll never look at a stick the same way again. OK, you will. But not for a few hours after the credits roll.1.The Gruffalo(2009)The original, the best, the one that spawned an entire genre of Donaldsonvision. A toasty tale of a mouse strolling through the woods in search of an acorn, outwitting the predators trying to eat him. How? By casually announcing that he’s off to meet a monster. But as any yule fule kno, there’s no such thing as a Gruffalo. Is there? Extra poignancy is lent by the fact that three of the star voices – Robbie Coltrane, John Hurt and Tom Wilkinson – are no longer with us. They’re joined by James Corden and Helena Bonham Carter. It could only have been improved by casting soundy-likey actors Mark Ruffalo and Janeane Garofalo.The Scarecrows’ Wedding airs on BBC One and BBC iPlayer at 3.10pm on Christmas Day.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionChildren's TVJulia DonaldsonAnimation on TVfeaturesShareReuse this content"

With Jennifer Saunders playing Joan, it’s the first time she and Joanna Lumley have shared a screen since Absolutely Fabulous.Ali CatterallFilm choiceA Minecraft Movie (Jared Hess, 2025),7.10am, 6.15pm, Sky Cinema PremiereDirector Jared Hess has a history of extreme silliness (see Napoleon Dynamite and Nacho Libre), so he is a great choice for this flight of fancy based on the popular building-block video game. In a superbly imagined right-angled world that runs on its own surreal logic, siblings Henry (Sebastian Hansen) and Natalie (Emma Myers) – guided by Jason Momoa’s ex-gamer, Garrett, and Jack Black’s salesman, Steve; a double act without a straight man – have to use their construction skills to defeat baddies from the Nether. Catnip for the under-12s.Simon WardellWallace & Gromit: Vengeance Most Fowl (Nick Park andMerlin Crossingham, 2024),11.40am, BBC OneView image in fullscreenWallace & Gromit: Vengeance Most Fowl.Photograph: Richard Davies/Courtesy of NetflixSixteen years after our previous peek into the world of wensleydale cheese addict Wallace and his dog (and perennial life-saver) Gromit, the release of this beguiling caper was like a family reunion. Also back in the fold is the big baddie from The Wrong Trousers: the silent but deadly Feathers McGraw, who manipulates Wallace’s latest invention – irritatingly cheerful robot gnome Norbot (Reece Shearsmith) – into carrying out his plan of revenge. And a nod to Ben Whitehead, who takes over seamlessly from Peter Sallis as the voice of Wallace.Simon WardellWhite Christmas (Michael Curtiz, 1954),1pm, BBC TwoMulled wine in film form, Bing Crosby’s musical has been a yuletide mainstay for decades. Ostensibly this is about entertainers tasked with saving a failing Vermont inn from closure, but really it’s just an excuse for someone to make a movie out of Irving Berlin’s famous song. The result is a warm, twinkly vehicle for the stars of the day. Danny Kaye steals scenes with his elastic-faced joy, Vera-Ellen dances like she predates gravity, and Technicolor Christmas cheer pours from every frame.Stuart HeritageThe Little Mermaid (Rob Marshall, 2023),6.30pm, E4Disney’s insistence on making “live-action” versions of its most beloved cartoons has only been a partial success, but Rob Marshall’s The Little Mermaid from 2023 is one of the better attempts. Halle Bailey’s Ariel is luminous, and possesses a voice that could melt stone; plus she’s matched by an underwater world that’s even more vibrant and alive than the animated version. True, not all of it lands – the world is still not ready for a song performed by a photorealistic fish – but it is sweet and sincere, and more emotionally complex than you might imagine.SHLive sportTestcricket: Australia v England,10.30pm, TNT Sports 1The Ashes resumes in Melbourne.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV tonightPeep ShowfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Such longevity is partly down to extra-commercial considerations, in that the series has a capacity for tickling adults’ funny bones – possibly even those now fully grown students – as well as the very young. Though it can’t claim anything quite as unexpected as the David Hasselhoff cameo in 2004’s TheSpongeBob SquarePantsMovie – not so much a high bar as an unforgettably wonky one – feature four thinks nothing of making Clancy Brown talk like a pirate while handing royalty cheques to Barbra Streisand and Yello. Anything can still happen in Bikini Bottom.Preceded by a festive short for Paramount’s other weathered babysitters, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, the new SpongeBob film soon settles into a familiarly goofy groove, its script a PG-rated treatise on the pros and cons of growth. This SpongeBob (once more voiced by Tom Kenny) is now 36 clams high, a source of particular excitement as this will allow him to ride the rollercoaster of his dreams. (One early, trippy laugh: our overexcitable hero’s imagined loop-the-loops.) As in the best contemporary American animation, though, the corkscrew plotting is the real rollercoaster. SB’s quest to obtain the fabled swashbuckler certificate that will prove him a “big guy” brings him into conflict with the Flying Dutchman, voiced by the suddenly ubiquitousMark Hamill.The Dutchman’s ship bumps up the scale, but mostly it’s the usual bricolage of digimation and hand-turned elements, forever foregrounding pleasing, properly cartoonish effects. SpongeBob wedges himself into an AC unit and somehow emerges squarer still; there’s a cameo from a pair of chattering joke-shop false teeth; and in a punishment guaranteed to resonate with the six-year-old crowd, our hero is subjected to endless washing-up. Whether its spitballing silliness will linger when the lights come up is debatable, but it’s a solid SpongeBob movie – and by far the funniest Pirates of the Caribbean movie, encompassing a hearty Davy Jones joke and a saltily suggestive catchphrase for SpongeBob’s pal Patrick: “The best guys are big guys.” Those students will be snickering anew.The SpongeBob Movie: Search for SquarePants is out on 19 December in the US, on 20 December in Ireland and on 26 December in Australia and the UK.Explore more on these topicsFilmAnimation in filmSpongeBob SquarePantsMark HamillComedy filmsComedyTelevisionreviewsShareReuse this content"

But 2026 begins with a very different true story, from someone who never chose the spotlight, but now wants some good to come of her appalling experiences. After the trial that resulted in her husband and 50 others being convicted of rape or sexual assault, Gisèle Pelicot’s aim is to nurture “strength and courage” in other survivors. InA Hymn to Life(Bodley Head, February) she insists that “shame has to change sides”. Another trial – of the men accused of carrying out the Bataclan massacre – was the subject of Emmanuel Carrère’s most recent book, V13. For his next,Kolkhoze(Fern, September), the French master of autofictionturns his unsparing lens back on himself, focusing on his relationship with his mother Hélène, and using it to weave a complex personal history of France, Russia and Ukraine. Family also comes under the microscope inGhost Stories(Sceptre, May) by Siri Hustvedt, a memoir of her final years with husband Paul Auster, who died of cancer in 2024.Hollywood isn’t totally out of the picture, though:The Steps(Seven Dials, May), Sylvester Stallone’s first autobiography, follows the star from homelessness in early 70s New York to Rocky’s triumph at the Oscars later that decade. Does achieving your creative dreams come at a price, though? Lena Dunham suggests as much inFamesick(4th Estate, April), billed as a typically frank memoir of how how her dramatic early success gave way to debilitating chronic illness. Frankness of a different kind is promised inMore(Bloomsbury, September), actor Gillian Anderson’s follow-up to her bestselling 2024 anthology of women’s sexual fantasies, Want.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Little, Brown Book GroupLikely to be somewhat less racy – though just as acutely observed – Alan Bennett’s diariesEnough Said(Faber, March) span the period 2016-2024, taking in such momentous events as Brexit and the death of the Queen, as well as a plague of molehills in Bennett’s garden. After relinquishing his mantle as host of In Our Time, Bennett’s near contemporary Melvyn Bragg travels back toAnother World(Sceptre, February), namely his three years at Oxford in the late 1950s. Curious Incident author Mark Haddon also looks to the past, this time to the 60s and 70s, in his quirkily illustrated coming of age memoir,Leaving Home(Chatto & Windus, February). David Sedaris’s latest collection of essaysThe Land and Its People(Abacus, July) includes such dispatches from his bucolic existence in Sussex as “I know you can’t hold animals to human standards … That said, rams are assholes.”We’ll have to see whether similarly intemperate outbursts are detailed in a major new biography ofGordon Brown(Bloomsbury, February), for which author James Macintyre was allowed “unique” access to the former prime minister’s personal archives. For his part, ex-home secretary and chancellor Sajid Javid will avoid dishing the dirt on recent governments, focusing instead on his childhood inThe Colour of Home(Abacus, February). And following her departure from the cabinet in September, Angela Rayner has decided to write a memoir – as yetUntitled(Bodley Head) – reflecting on her tough upbringing and path into politics, set to be released in the second half of the year.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Penguin Books LtdAway from life writing, North American heavyweights tackle the big ideas: inA World Appears(Allen Lane, February) by Michael Pollan, the author of How to Change Your Mind considers the small matter of consciousness – what is it, and how do you measure it? WithThe Beginning Comes After the End(Granta, March), Rebecca Solnit reminds us how revolutionary the past 60 years have been in terms of social change. She views the current turn towards authoritarianism as setback, rather than defeat. Doppelganger author Naomi Klein teams up with documentary maker Astra Taylor to describeEnd Times Fascism(Allen Lane, September), the “man-made Armageddon complex” built by religious fundamentalists, tech barons and nationalists that threatens democracy. Jared Diamond, the historian best known for Guns, Germs and Steel, returns with his first book in six years,Profits, Prophets, Coaches and Kings(Allen Lane, September), on the influence of charismatic individuals in politics, business, sport and religion. And Patrick Radden Keefe, whose Empire of Pain exposed the billionaire dynasty behind the opioid epidemic, investigates the mysterious death of a young man inLondon Falling(Picador, April).Following the extraordinary success of Adolescence, the Netflix show that showed the aftermath of a misogynistic killing, teenage masculinity remains front and centre. One of its stars, Stephen Graham, has teamed up with psychologist Orly Klein to compileLetters to Our Sons(Bloomsbury, October), a collection of fathers’ reflections on “what it means to be man”, including one from the actor himself. And inThe Castle(Viking, August),Jon Ronson embarks on a journey to discover exactly what led his son Joel to attend a mysterious event at a multi-millionaire’s mansion in New England, in the process uncovering “a world of unmoored men on a desperate search for purpose”.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Hodder & StoughtonI was going to say Liza Minnelli’s memoir may provide some light relief, but the Cabaret star’s life has contained at least as much tragedy and heartache as it has spotlights and sequins. Still, you’ll be able to read about both inKids, Wait Till You Hear This!, “as told to” her friend and singer Michael Feinstein – though if you’re expecting a studiedly neutral account, you might have to wait a bit longer: the emphasis is on “dispelling tabloid myths and setting the record straight”. A lower-key but no less interesting musical star, David Byrne, brings us his first proper book since 2012’s How Music Works,Sleeping Beauties(Canongate, October). The title refers to works of art or inventions that are ignored at the time but resurface after years of dormancy – from Bruegel to antiseptics. Finally, inTonight the Music Seems So Loud(Picador, June), journalist Sathnam Sanghera takes a break from empire to explore just what it was that made enigmatic pop genius George Michael such an influential cultural figure, 10 years after his death at the age of 53.To browse and preorder the titles in the 2026 lookahead, visitguardianbookshop.com.

In 1924 there was no tsar, let alone his bureaucrats, the tchinovniks. The date is significant, but I don’t mind admitting I had to find out why online. The time, as Hamlet says, is out of joint.The rudely awakened sleeper is Benedykt Gierosławski, a Polish philosopher, logician, mathematician and gambler whose debts will be erased if he undertakes a special mission for the Ministry. He is to travel to Siberia, “the wild east”, and find his father, Filip, who was exiled there for anti-government activities. This is not clemency. Filip is now known as Father Frost, and as a geologist, radical and mystic, he might have a connection with what has occurred. The reader is drip-fed the details. A comet fell into Tunguska in Siberia in 1908, as it did in our universe. But here the event has caused the emergence of an inexplicable, expanding, possibly sentient coldness called the “gleiss”. Ice, which won the European Union prize for literature, came out in Poland in 2007, well before the Game of Thrones TV adaptation made “winter is coming” a meme; but in this novel, it certainly is.Ice is not just a cerebral romp – there’s hilarity and horror, chapters full of pathos, a moment unfurling a life of regretsThe “black physics” caused by the comet’s impact has created new materials and technologies: superconducting “coldiron”, “frostoglaze” and “blackwickes” that emit “unlicht”. More than that, it has created an entirely new geopolitical situation. Neither the Russian Revolution nor the first world war has taken place. It is not just history that has been reconfigured: ideology has also been transformed. The great fissure is between the Ottepyelniks, who advocate Thaw, and the Lyednyaks, who wish to preserve the gleiss. This is not a simple transposition of the idea of a “cold war”. Some Siberian entrepreneurs rely on the gleiss for their technological advantage, while others see in its absolute frozen stasis a kind of religious transcendence. The tsar seems to favour its elimination, with Russia becoming part of a European “Summer” cluster of powers. The gleiss sharpens dichotomies: Slavophiles and westernisers, imperial tsarists against Polish and Siberian nationalists, anarchists against autarchs, materialists against spiritualists.Benedykt, as a gambler and scientist, is intrigued by how chance operates under the gleiss. Basically, randomness and probabilities are certainties; quantum fuzziness becomes crystal clear. He is not alone in his fascination: a fellow passenger on his journey is none other than Nikola Tesla. And Tesla is not alone as a real person in the fiction: we meet Aleister Crowley, Trotsky and Rasputin, among others. The novel has three acts; firstly, Benedykt on the Trans-Siberian express train (there are plots, deaths, spies, double agents), then his time in the political hotbeds and laboratories of Irkutsk, then finally his journey into the wastes along the mysterious “Ways of the Mammoth”.The publishers should be commended for giving the translator, Ursula Phillips, an appendix in which to discuss her translation. Her choices, compromises and ingenuity are made clear, especially since the style reflects Gierosławski’s opening, where Benedykt thinks he might not exist. The first person, the “I”, is therefore dropped: “Stand facing … release air from the lungs …” Phillips argues against accusations of “untranslatability”, though the cultural references are problematic to convey. But her decisions provide an anchor for the reader amid an almost obligatory obliquity. A novel about the world’s complexity needs to be complicated; the truth is sometimes slant. It is telling that Dukaj recommended Phillips read Thomas Pynchon’s Mason & Dixon during her work.Ice is not just a cerebral romp. There are moments of hilarity and horror; chapters full of pathos, a moment unfurling a life of regrets. It is a gloomy, sharp, dazzling work. If things had been different, Dukaj asks, would they just turn out the same?Ice by Jacek Dukaj, translated by Ursula Phillips, is published by Head of Zeus (£25).

Fight demons, fend off unwanted admirers and survive work shifts in this queer, neon homage to 1990s PlayStation-era horror.MEClues by SamWeb browserThe trick of this daily logic puzzle is that you can’t guess, or make wrong answers. Presented with a grid of characters, you must identify the “innocent” and the “criminal” based on clues revealed with each correct answer. But the game will only accept an answer if it’s sure you know it for a fact. An idealistic vision of a criminal justice system.Duncan FyfeBlippo+Switch, Playdate, PCBlippo+ is a channel surfing simulator that rides the line between video game and absurd cable subscription service.

Best enjoyed with the curtains drawn.BAMDeltarunePS4/5, Switch, Switch 2, PCFrom its tongue-in-cheek writing to its ridiculous creatures, Toby Fox’s episodic role-playing game is charming and witty.

Now its gaming academies offer a chance to earn a six-figure salary – if you make the gradeRaphael Rashidin SeoulWed 24 Dec 2025 19.05 ESTLast modified on Wed 24 Dec 2025 19.06 ESTShareSon Si-woo remembers the moment his mother turned off his computer. He was midway through an interview to become a professional gamer.“She said when I played computer games, my personality got worse, that I was addicted to games,” the 27-year-old recalls.Then Son won an amateur tournament. The prize money was 2m won (£1,000). He handed all of it to his parents. “From then on, they believed in me,” he says.Almost a decade later, Son, known professionally as Lehends, is a multiple champion in League of Legends, a competitive strategy game. He plays for Nongshim RedForce, a professional team backed by one of South Korea’s largest food companies.The trajectory of his career mirrors a wider reversal in how South Korea views gaming itself.Kimchi, made in China: how South Korea’s national dish is being priced out at homeRead moreIn October this year, President Lee Jae Myungdeclared that“games are not addictive substances”, a sharp break from 2013, when there was alegislative pushto classify gaming as one of four major social addictions alongside drugs, gambling and alcohol.That shift has been accompanied by rapid growth. Between 2019 and 2023, the domestic gaming market expanded by 47% to be worth 22.96tn won (£11.7bn), with industry exports rising 41% in that time to10.96tn won(£5.6bn). The market accounted for nearly two-thirds of all Korean content exports, far exceeding any other cultural sector, including K-pop.Part of that ecosystem is esports: organised competitive gaming centred on professional leagues and teams. In 2023, the sectorwas worthabout 257bn won (£128m), a small share of the wider industry, but one that carries an outsized role as a showcase and marketing engine, shaping how games are promoted, sponsored and consumed.Korea now ranks fourth globally in gaming market share, behind the United States, China and Japan.From curfews to cultural keystoneFor a country that once forced teenagersoffline at midnight, the change is dramatic. Gaming is now treated as legitimate work and a strategic industry.The transformation has its roots in the late 1990s, when South Korea emerged from the Asian financial crisis and invested heavily in broadband infrastructure. Internet cafés, known as PC bangs, spread rapidly as informal social spaces. Around 7,800 operate nationwide today.By the late 2000s, professional matches of StarCraft, another strategy game, were filling stadiums. Broadcasting channels established formal leagues, and major corporations including Samsung, SK Telecom and KT began sponsoring teams.Today, esports-focused programmes exist at a dozen schools and universities, and many more institutions offer degrees related to gaming. The final stages of a major tournament were recentlybroadcast on terrestrial television, with fans following players much like pop idols.View image in fullscreenPlayers at a PC bang, or internet cafe, in Guro district, western Seoul.Photograph: Raphael RashidA 1% chance of making itAt Nongshim Esports academy in Guro district, western Seoul, the training rooms are compact and starkly white. Teenagers and young adults hunch over their screens in near silence as coaches hover between desks offering quiet instructions. This is where the dreams are built, albeit for a select few.Along one corridor, rows of trophies and awards are displayed. There’s also a dormitory for professional players and a canteen overseen by a nutritionist.Twenty-two-year-old Roh Hyun-jun is on leave from his mechanical engineering degree. University, he says, is a backup plan. For now, he trains in hopes of becoming a professional League of Legends player.“When you play team games with five people, you really feel that sense of unity,” Roh says. “It’s not just me winning alone, but everyone moving in the same direction to achieve victory.”The academy, run by the same conglomerate that sponsors Lehends’ team, charges about 500,000 won (£253) for 20 hours of training a month.Evans Oh, CEO of Nongshim Esports, which operates the academy, says only about 1–2% of trainees go on to become professional players or secure related esports jobs, a conversion rate he says is “not that low, but not that high”. Since opening in 2018, it has produced 42 professionals.Training at such academies can resemble elite sport, with long days devoted to gameplay, video analysis and team strategy, alongside psychological coaching.Top-tier playerscan earnwell into six figures in US dollar terms through a mix of salaries, prize money and sponsorships.In a recent education ministrysurveyof students, professional gamer ranked fifth among desired jobs for elementary school boys.

It’s that kind of market.”Aiden Lee, secretary-general of League of Legends Champions Korea (LCK), the country’s top esports league, says South Korea’s dominance, evidenced by LCK teamswinning 10 out of the 15 world championships, reflects the intensity of the competitive environment Koreans grow up in.“What makes the difference is competition and concentration,” he says. “Korean pro players can practise more than 16 hours a day. The amount of practice and focus is very different.”The government now frames its role as balancing growth with protection. Seven state-supported “healing centres” operate nationwide for young people considered overly immersed in gaming, offering consultations in partnership with hospitals.Standard contractsfor youth players cap official training hours, in what officials describe as an effort to ensure healthy competition.Back at the academy, Roh, the trainee, remains focused. “I want to leave my name as the most famous pro gamer,” he says. “Since I’ve chosen this path, I want to do my best.”Explore more on these topicsSouth KoreaGamesAsia PacificfeaturesShareReuse this content"

They open up on making amazing TV … and why morals matter more than nice handbagsRóisín LaniganThu 25 Dec 2025 01.00 ESTShareFew people are less daunted about the prospect of turning 30 than Lola Petticrew. “I used to be so afraid of getting old, and now I just think it’s the best thing ever,” they say. “I feel like I’m just coming into myself. And it feels fucking amazing. I think it’s such a fantastic thing to age – all the shit starts falling away and what you care about becomes more concentrated. I know what I want my life to be now, and I’m pretty stern on it. I don’t have to care about anything else.”They’re telling me this over Zoom from New York, where Petticrew is shooting Furious, the new show by Elizabeth Meriwether (New Girl, Dying for Sex). Petticrew plays a character who was sex-trafficked as a child and is now out for revenge, tailed by an FBI agent played by Emmy Rossum.The role is a departure for Petticrew – who also just signed on for Netflix’s new Assassin’s Creed adaptation. They’ve spent much of the past year playing two Irish women of the Troubles generation. In November 2024 they starred as IRA agent Dolours Price inSay Nothing, an adaptation of Patrick Radden Keefe’s true-crime book of the same name. And this November, in Channel 4’sTrespasses, they played Cushla Lavery, a young Catholic teacher who becomes involved with an older Protestant married man, with disastrous consequences. From those broad strokes of description, you might think there’s much to compare in the two roles, Petticrew’s biggest to date.“The two of them actually couldn’t be any different,” they say. “Which is why it was so funny when people said, ‘Oh, you’re doing another Troubles story!’ These stories, these characters couldn’t be more different. It’s a funny thing that’s preserved for Irish actors and Irish stories, for some reason. I’ve never heard anyone say to an American actor, ‘Oh, are you going to do another American one?’ Or an English person, ‘Oh, you’re doing another English one?’ So it’s very odd that when I, as an Irish actor, choose to tell back-to-back Irish stories, it’s seen as weird.”View image in fullscreen‘It’s very odd that when I, as an Irish actor, choose to tell back-to-back Irish stories, it’s seen as weird’ … Petticrew with Gillian Anderson in Trespasses.Photograph: WildgazeWhen Petticrew finds something odd, immoral or plain unfair, they will tell you so. They’ve used their platform over the past year to speak out in support of Palestine, to raise awareness for intergenerational trauma back home – like Dolours Price, they hail from westBelfast– and against classism and nepotism in the arts world. It’s a “posh boys’ club”, they tell me of acting in the UK and Ireland. “Nobody’s denying that these people are talented. What we’re talking about is making sure that working-class kids have the same opportunities so you don’t just end up with a bunch of one type of person in the arts – which is what we have. When I was growing up, it didn’t feel like a career in this industry was actually possible. When you come from wealth, you think that you can do anything. The world is open to you.”There is pressure on many young actors to soften the views that Petticrew espouses so passionately. In February this year, Petticrew won best actor at the Iftas (Irish Film andTelevisionawards) for their portrayal of Dolours Price, and used their speech to call out government inaction on the high rates of suicide in the north of Ireland for the generation who grew up in the aftermath of the Troubles – often termed “ceasefire babies”.View image in fullscreen‘People want you to be less mouthy, but it’s not being divisive. It’s being on the right side of history’ … Petticrew as Cushla with Tom Cullen as Michael in Trespasses.Photograph: Steffan Hill/Channel 4“There’s a sentiment from some people that I should be quiet and stop talking about it,” they say. “Wouldn’t it be lovely if I could shut up? I would love to do what other actors do and promote the thing and wear nice clothes and not have to think about all that. But it’s not a privilege that I have, unfortunately, because I can’t change the way that I grew up or where I’m from and the love that I have for it and the people who are being failed at every single avenue. If somebody’s giving me space to speak, it might as well be about something that matters.“People want you to be less mouthy and just be grateful. But it’s not being divisive. It’s being on the right side of history. And I just don’t think any bag in the world is worth shaking the morals that I have.”In Trespasses, Petticrew’s Cushla Lavery struggles with questions of morality and privacy, grappling with how to speak up for herself in a society that functions overwhelmingly on the basis of cultural omertà. Over the course of the series she learns to advocate for herself and for her community. It doesn’t necessarily stop her – or her love story – from being doomed. Although there’s eventual cautious hope for Cushla (and for the place she lives) at the end of the series – “giving the audience space to exhale”, Petticrew says of the show’s coda – her story remains tied up in the wider cultural story of the Troubles. “Cushla is quite able to stick up for herself, but there’s a softness in her,” says Petticrew, who devoured Trespasses, written by the Belfast author Louise Kennedy, and called her agent instantly to ask to audition for the role, even before the TV adaptation was picked up.View image in fullscreenPetticrew as Dolours Price in Say Nothing.Photograph: Channel 4“I suppose I knew both versions of these women,” they say of Cushla and Dolours. “I think that’s the thing about Irish people, isn’t it? We’re storytellers, and I think a lot of our houses are very matriarchal. And you quite often find yourself in situations, especially when you’re a kid, where it’s just a lot of women talking. I definitely grew up like that as well, and what a lovely way to grow up.”‘If you get it wrong, it’s sacrilegious!’ TV’s problem with Irish accentsRead moreIt’s unsurprising, then, that any chance they get, Petticrew will return home to their beloved west Belfast. That’s what they’re planning to do not long after we speak, boarding a plane back east just in time for Christmas (and their 30th birthday on 26 December). “I cannot wait,” they say. “I’ll be straight on that plane, straight to my house, straight on my sofa with my dog, getting a west Belfast Chinese.”What is a west Belfast Chinese, exactly? Well: salt and chilli chips with all the vegetables. Fried rice, chicken curry off the breast. Peas, fried onions, soft noodles with gravy. Then chicken balls, which are hollowed out and the batter filled with all of the aforementioned Chinese, which will be used much like a prawn cracker to dip into the curry sauce you’ve also ordered.Petticrew explains all this without taking a breath. I blink. It’s possibly the most divisive thing they’ve ever said. “If you do it once, you’ll do it every time,” they say, and it’s convincing enough to make me take their word for it.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionBelfastNorthern IrelandfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But, realistically, nothing could keep them away ...Hannah Al-OthmanThu 25 Dec 2025 00.00 ESTShare‘If you lot are listening on the hill … Bring It on Down,” Liam Gallagher said from the stage,dedicating the Oasis trackto ticketless fans who had gathered in Heaton Park. When the band played their run of Manchester homecoming shows in July, an estimated 10,000 people made their way to what became known as “Gallagher Hill” over the five-night run.TheManchestershows were the only UK gigs that took place in a public space, as opposed to stadiums. Manchester city council had warned those without tickets to stay away, going so far as to erect another fence to block the view when word began to spread that people were gathering. But all attempts to discourage them were futile, as word about the “electric” atmosphere spread on social media.Dean Russell and friend Mark Pridgeon had already booked a hotel room near the park before tickets went on sale; they didn’t manage to secure any for the Manchester gigs, but decided to make the journey from Southampton anyway. They were among the first 50 or so people to climb the then unnamed “Gallagher Hill”.View image in fullscreenSupernova … Oasis fans gather on ‘Gallagher Hill’. Some have called for the site to be officially renamed.Photograph: Ryan Jenkinson/Story Picture Agency/Shutterstock“We walked up the hill, and when you got to the crest you could look out and see the screens,” Russell said. “You could hear the music, and as it went on more and more people joined.” To have been one of the first people on the hill, he says, was something special. “You feel privileged that you’re part of that history. It was an amazing and magical night. It’s going to sound cheesy, but the atmosphere was electric.”Vicky Hindle, who lives in nearby Prestwich, was also there on the first night with her 16-year-old twins Oliver and Ryan. She went back for a second night; her sons enjoyed it so much they were there for every single Manchester date. “The first two nights [before the screens were blocked off] it was like being in the gig,” she says. “It was such a good thing for the area and for the community. You’d see so many people there that you knew, and then people that you didn’t know. Everybody was having fun, and it was brilliant.”WhileOasisconcerts may have a reputation as rowdy gatherings where one runs the risk of being sprayed by pints flying through the air, on Gallagher Hill at least, families felt at home. Claire Furness drove up from Sheffield with her 14-year-old son, Sam. “We had no tickets, so we ended up on ‘Gallagher Hill’,” she says. At first Sam was disappointed, but as he heard the band come on stage, he burst into tears. “He cried all the way through. It was just immense. There were young people, old people, people from different countries. Everybody singing at the top of their voice, everybody knew the words.”View image in fullscreenRolling with it … Oasis fans on ‘Gallagher Hill’. The site is now marked on Google Maps.Photograph: Jake Lindley/Story Picture Agency/ShutterstockClare Still travelled from Derbyshire with her nine-year-old son Connor after trying and failing to buy tickets for the gigs. “This was his first experience of anything big musically, and he absolutely loved it,” she said. “The atmosphere was phenomenal. I did wonder how he was going to go, given that we couldn’t see, but he was just so excited, singing, dancing; when Champagne Supernova came on at the end and they let the fireworks off, he was completely mesmerised. On the way home, he said, ‘This has been the best night ever, mummy’. That was good enough for me. He’s just constantly asking for Oasis to be on now.”On the final night, fans on their way up the hill were handed “Gallagher Hill” T-shirts; a gift from the band, who’d had a thousand printed. “The T-shirt that I’ve got is framed on my wall. I won’t ever be getting rid of that,” says James Mulville, who had come down from Kendal with his mother and aunt. “People are selling them on eBay for silly amounts of money, but I won’t be getting rid of mine. There’s memories on that.”So special was the experience, says Mulville, “they need to rename it officially as Gallagher Hill.” While the council is yet to erect a sign or a plaque, online at least, the site has been immortalised. The fences may have come down, and the resident cows are freely grazing once more, but on Google Maps a red pin still marks the point, beside the words: “Gallagher Hill”.Explore more on these topicsOasis2025: what happened next?ManchesterGreater ManchesterPop and rockfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Archive image: courtesy of Dr Alex GeorgeBorn in Carmarthen in 1991, Dr Alex George is a former NHS doctor, an author and a mental health campaigner. After studying medicine at the Peninsula College of Medicine and Dentistry, he worked as an A&E doctor in London before joining the cast of 2018’s Love Island. In 2021, he was appointed the UK government’s youth mental health ambassador. He is the author of five books; his latest, Happy Habits, is out now, with Am I Normal? published on 15 January.Mum loved to make outfits for specialoccasions, and Christmas was no exception. It was an important time of year for our family; she was determined for us to experience the magic of tradition. It would have been a small, intimate day in Capel Dewi in Carmarthenshire – just me, my parents, my two brothers and my grandmother.I was a happy, sensitive boy, with a very vivid imagination. But a few years after this was taken, I started to have friction with the school system. Rejection sensitivity dysphoria is not yet part of the framework of diagnosis for ADHD, but a lot of us find it the hardest part. It meant that criticism from teachers and friends – even when they weren’t actually rejecting me – would cripple me. I was constantly living with the feeling of not being good enough and not fitting in. I struggled to concentrate in class. Once, I remember asking absent-mindedly if Santa was a man or woman, and the teacher went so ballistic that the teacher next door heard and came to comfort me.Much of what I witnessed during the pandemic can’t be repeated; it’s too horrific for most people to handleEventually I got put into a separate classroom, one for kids who were struggling with varying levels of disability. Mum had to come in and say: “I know Alex is pretty bright, so what’s going on here?” In front of me, the teacher replied: “I just think we need to lower our expectations of Alex in life.”While I will never forget that moment, it gave me the determination to prove them wrong. All I needed was an incentive. In fact, when it came to my GCSEs, Dad said he’d give me £100 towards a car for every A I got. Money was tight at the time, and Mum was cross with him for making that promise. But it worked. I got straight As.I watched a lot of24 Hours in A&Egrowing up. After I graduated in 2015, I went to work in King’s College London – the same hospital featured in the show. It was intense, but it was my dream job, and I was content. One day, I got a message through a dating app from a TV producer who said: “We’d love to talk to you about coming on Love Island.” I declined, and laughed it off. But they were persistent. Around the same time, my friend Freya Barlow, a fellow medical student, got acute myeloid leukaemia. She had multiple rounds of chemo and a bone transplant. She didn’t have long to live and said: “Alex, you’re so capable. I want you to throw yourself into things more. I can’t continue my life so please live yours.” I don’t think she meant Love Island, but it was the thing that came into my mind. I went for an interview and was offered a place in 2018. I said yes. At the very least, I thought it could be a holiday for a few weeks.Being put into the spotlight was overwhelming. But it was nothing compared with the pandemic. I was working in A&E at University Hospital Lewisham at the time. Much of what I witnessed can’t be repeated; it’s too horrific for most people to handle. The number of people dying was huge, and constant, but I also had to tell families: “You can’t come in to say goodbye to your dying wife, who is 30. Here’s an iPhone so you can talk to her instead.” I had that conversation hundreds of times. That is not a normal way of looking after grieving people. We couldn’t provide the level of care necessary and it made me feel like the devil.Because I was working in the pandemic, I hadn’t seen my family for a long time, but I was due to go to Wales to visit them in the summer. A week before, I got a phone call from my dad, and my whole life changed. My19-year-old brother, Llŷr, had killed himself.I was diagnosed with OCD recently and am being treated for that. I wouldn’t say my mental health is perfect, but I am much more functionalDuring those first days of shock, I had to grab our family in freefall. If I hadn’t, my parents would have ended up dead or sectioned. They were like children, unable to function. I was minus 100 in terms of my stability, but I had to take the lead. I spoke at the funeral. I took my mum out in the car for three hours a day so she was out of the house. She needed time away from Dad so they wouldn’t make each other worse.Two days after Llŷr died, I wrote to my manager and said: “I’m going to carry on writing my book.” She wrote back: “You’re insane, you’ve just lost your brother.” I wasn’t doing it in a callous way; I was in a black hole and trying to cling on to things that would make me feel normal. What I really needed was to accept that nothing would be the same ever again. Now I know that the only relief I’ll get from grief is death. It sounds crazy, and I really do want to live, but when I look at my parents, I feel jealous that they are closer to that relief than I am.Three years ago, I sat down in myhairdresser’s and looked in the mirror. I realised I had completely lost myself. I was 20st but mostly what shocked me was my eyes. I thought: “I don’t even know where Alex is any more.” I was campaigning and working too hard and drinking a lot more than usual. I was trying to numb myself. So I needed to change something. I put down the bottle, and went for a walk each day, which is how my podcastThe Stompcaststarted.As well as sobriety I realised I needed exercise and therapy. Since then, I’ve had ups and downs – I was diagnosed with OCD recently and am being treated for that. I wouldn’t say my mental health is perfect, and it never will be, but I am much more functional.Anna Maxwell Martin looks back: ‘I was bullied a little bit, but it didn’t affect me because I was a happy weirdo’Read moreBeing in nature with my dog Rolo is the most beneficial thing. I also ride my motorcycle, take antidepressants, listen to classical music, and am careful about who I spend my time with. I don’t watch the news too much because it can be triggering.I have realised that while I can’t bring my brother back, I can try to help others. Mum does, too – she has put her amazing costume skills to good use and raised lots of money knitting for charity.The day after my brother died, my friend drove me to Llansteffan beach. It was a busy summer’s afternoon. As soon as I arrived, it felt as if the crowds parted. Everyone seemed to fall silent; they all knew what had happened. I walked through them, and when I turned back, life had resumed. The kids were playing, waves kept rolling in and out, the birds kept tweeting. And in that moment, I realised that life goes on. The sun will always shine on Llansteffan beach, and we are all just grains of sand.In the UK and Ireland,Samaritanscan be contacted on freephone 116 123, or emailjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.In the US, you can call or text theNational Suicide Prevention Lifelineon 988, chat on988lifeline.org, ortext HOMEto 741741 to connect with a crisis counselor.

Since then there have been countless adventures: road trips, dive bars, rock camps …Amy FlemingThu 25 Dec 2025 08.00 ESTShareKicking-out time, January 2004, and Laura and I are sitting on the kerb waiting for a bus outside Alexandra Palace in north London. Not that we’re in a hurry to be anywhere else. We’re having the best time on our kerb, cheeks flushed from hard liquor and the exhilaration of the White Stripes show we’ve just seen. We’re busy communing with a fellow nocturnal creature, a woodlouse. It is one of those rare moments in my 20s when just about everything feels right.Laura and I had quietly become office allies over a few years, a bond initially forming around our mutual shy diligence in the face of not fully fitting in. We would conspiratorially skip downstairs to the canteen together most lunchtimes and temper any work worries by chatting shit, laughing hysterically and plotting small acts of rebellion. (Like the time we childishly made a “FUCK CHESS” sign and left it on the office chess club’s shelf, which for some reason felt necessary and hilarious. If you’re reading this, chess club, we’re very sorry.)The White Stripes coming to town was our pivotal moment. We’d never been so bold as to make plans together outside our professional sphere before, and we were still respectfully reserved with each other – first date vibes, as it were.Jack and Meg White were over fromDetroitpromoting their fourth album, Elephant. The support band, Blanche, came from Detroit, too, and their Motor City-greased gothic country enchanted us with its banjo, lap steel, gallows humour and irresistible showbiz mystique. Then came the mighty drama and conventions peculiar to the Stripes – virtuosity versus naivete, sonic sweetness versus wigging the fuck out – that held us in childlike wonder. This was the spirit in which our long friendship began in earnest, and in which on some level it has continued ever since.Laura and I had needed this release. We were both struggling in our own ways to shrug off the stifling “shoulds” of twentysomethingness: establish career, get on property ladder, breed, and all manner of more nuanced crummy expectations. Accompanying our post-show exhilaration was a bereftness at it being over. We were instantly pining for a way to prolong our escape from what we had come to call Tall Buildings (as in offices), the title of a song by US folk singer John Hartford.Ally Pally sits in a park on top of a hill with a panoramic view of the city below, and looking down over it, as its inhabitants switched off their lights and turned in for the night, made us even more wistful and defiant. A good night out can be a portal to a secret world where the daytime rules are suspended, revealing different possibilities and perspectives. We wished we could go and see what Detroit was like – the place that harboured these bands and so much other creativity, from Motown, the MC5 and the Stooges to Parliament, Funkadelic, Eminem and more.The bus, when it finally came, was brutally lit. As we chugged down the hill on our portal back to normality we resolved to do just that and, come May, we were there, sniffing the spring-fragranced trees, compulsively photographing graffiti, fire escapes and steam rising romantically from underground air vents, choking back tears while singing Stop in the Name of Love during a tour of Motown’s original home. We saw Blanche play and were invited backstage to meet the band and their friends … Jack and Meg. We felt like absolute idiots but they welcomed us awkward British strangers graciously.This was the start of a series of Homeric road trips, herculean nights out and epic friend-making sessions with Laura, in which one thing always led serendipitously to another. There have been dive bars, rock camps, tour buses, back-up singing sessions and late-night samosa street feasting. Together we have been charmed by an old bluesman and terrified by an Elvis fanatic in Mississippi, dipped our toes in Nashville’s Old Hickory Lake, taken a bonkers minibus ride with the Pixies in Chicago, pranced across Brooklyn Bridge in a blizzard in the early hours and generally gone looking for trouble, as Laura would say, which I love.Explore more on these topicsFriendshipMy big night outThe White StripesDetroitMotown recordsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I’m not up for being monitoredMy boyfriend, Peter, is obsessed with monitoring our water consumption and it’s driving me insane.It started innocently enough. One evening, he noticed our water bill was high. I shrugged it off, but he tried to get the water company to reduce the bill, and when he couldn’t, he became obsessive. Every night, he started going outside with his torch, checking the water meter, as if he were a security guard doing the rounds.He’s now implemented these rules. Peter times my showers and nags me not to flush the toilet after a wee, which I think is gross. He’s forever sending me articles about the optimal shower length, or how many litres of water are used during a toilet flush. When I wash my hair, which takes time because it’s thick and curly, I hear Peter sigh loudly in the hallway. Afterwards, he says things like, “you probably used the weekly quota in there”, and “30 mins is 300 litres of water, you know”, while showing me the timer on his phone.Peter behaves as if we’re in a drought. He makes me reuse the water after I’ve boiled eggsWho gets to decide the weekly quota? We’ve lived together for four years, and I’m not up for being monitored. Peter behaves as if we’re in a drought. He makes me reuse the water after I’ve boiled eggs. I don’t have a problem with that in theory, but it’s annoying always having a pan out – one time I knocked it over.Peter also wants us to limit our dishwasher use – he only thinks we should use it after we’ve accumulated lots of pots and pans. I refuse. He also recently tried to show me a spreadsheet he’d made comparing the efficiency of different showerheads.We live in an area where the water provider constantly puts up bills, and it makes Peter angry. I get it, but there’s not much we can do.I respect sustainability, but Peter’s fixation feels invasive. I don’t tell him how long he can spend in the shower or running the tap when he brushes his teeth. Bills go up, that’s life. I just want to shower in peace without feeling as though I’m being observed by the water police.The defence: PeterEveryone lets these water firms do what they like. It’s time to fight back. So we need to cut our usageWinnie may hate that I’m a little obsessed with water, but I’m not trying to be controlling. I just want to stop getting scammed by the water company and drowning in bills. It’s for both of us.I’m an electrician and she’s an artist, so we aren’t rolling in money. So yes, I check the meter and make spreadsheets comparing showerheads, but it’s for the greater good. It’s not true that I time Winnie’s showers like a prison guard. I simply make a note if they go above 30 mins, because apparently 30 minutes in the shower can use up to 400 litres of water.Winnie has started saving water from boiling eggs and I appreciate that. She did get annoyed when she knocked the pan on to the floor, but that shouldn’t be a reason not to save water. The bigger issue is that Winnie wants to run our dishwasher twice a day and flush the toilet after dropping a single tissue in it.I’m a bit of an anarchist at heart, and said we should stop paying our bills and see what happens, but Winnie wouldn’t let meI’m just trying to fight back against a corrupt water company that keeps hiking our bills while paying dividends to shareholders. I’m a bit of an anarchist at heart, and said we should stop paying our bills and see what happens, but Winnie wouldn’t let me. The problem is that everyone just lets these companies do what they want. We need to fight back.Winnie grew up in a posh part of the UK, whereas I had a more working-class upbringing. She loves long showers, having a cleaner and buying nice food. And that’s fine – so do I – but in order to afford lovely things, we need to get smart about saving money elsewhere.We want to have kids, but we need to tighten our belts first – that includes using the dishwasher less and having shorter showers. I’ve tried to get us to agree on only loading the dishwasher once a day and taking shorter showers. Winnie sees these as punishments. But they’re small steps toward fiscal and environmental responsibility.I’m not the villain here. I’m the partner trying to save money so she can have a nice life.The jury of Guardian readersShould Peter pipe down about the water?Winnie has compromised by reusing the egg water. Perhaps she could also compromise on the dishwasher, but Peter won’t win against the water companies by being passive-aggressive to Winnie through the bathroom door. Let a woman shower in peace.Jess, 28Peter has translated “penny wise and pound foolish” into a plumbing context. Sure, the pennies he’ll save by counting the litres will add up. But will they be worth the damage he’s clearly doing to his relationship with Winnie? Life’s not measured out by the litre.Richard, 38I’m all for saving water but there must be ways to be creative about it without making your partner anxious. I suggest Peter joins a campaign to hold the water company to account as it will help him to feel he’s making a difference. Good on him for caring – but he needs to keep his relationship afloat.Cate, 51Peter has gone over the line from fiscal and environmental responsibility into controlling, intrusive behaviour. When they moved in together Winnie didn’t agree to these rules, and Peter shouldn’t have imposed them without discussion.Evie, 40We are in a climate crisis, and the sooner we realise that the better. Half-hour showers are excessive. Water is a finite resource that we need to use sparingly, and while studying showerheads may not be everyone’s cup of tea, mother nature needs more Peters.Mark, 57Now you be the judgeIn our online poll, tell us: is Peter plumbing the depths?The poll closes on Wednesday 31 December at 9am GMTLast week’s resultsWe asked whetherJoe should stop calling all sweet things buns57%of you said yes – Joe is guilty43%of you said no – Joe is not guiltyExplore more on these topicsLife and styleYou be the judgefeaturesShareReuse this content"

While not every family visit or post-Christmas getaway is going to be a trip to Rancho Relaxo, a few things can help us catch holiday kip. Pre-departure apps can be useful, so can pillow mists and thermoregulation, but when it comes to maximising rest on the road, some say less is more.Don’t fear the first nightOur sleeping-while-travelling woes often begin before we leave home. Between frantic last-minute packing, finishing up work and early departures “you’re [likely] already a bit sleep deprived”, says Dr Sutapa Mukherjee, a respiratory and sleep physician and professor at Flinders University in Adelaide.Compound that with the logistics of actually getting to your final destination and even a relatively short travel time can put sleep hygiene off kilter.Why do we yawn? It’s almost certainly not for the reason you thinkRead moreAs we lay our heads down that first night, Dr Moira Junge, a health psychologist and the chief executive of theSleepHealth Foundation, says not to freak out if we toss and turn. “In sleep science there is a well known phenomenon called ‘the first night effect’. It’s really common – your senses are adjusting to different sounds and smells, the mattress pressure and level of darkness … but you will adapt, quickly.”Take your rituals with youSleep scientists agree that developing a bedtime routine is good for sleep year round, and it can be particularly helpful to keep it up away from home. Mukherjee says most parents recognise the importance of sleep rituals for their children: bathing, a warm drink, some reading, but too often overlook how helpful they are for adults too.View image in fullscreenFlight attendant Sharlene Loo prepares for bed by spending ‘10 to 20 minutes’ with her feet in the air.Photograph: Djordje Markovic/Getty ImagesFor Sharlene Loo, an 11-year veteran of Emirates’ lauded cabin crew who has visited more than 100 countries, that routine includes showering and skin care before lying in an L-shape with her feet in the air “for 10 to 20 minutes”. Loo says this helps with circulation and has become a daily habit and mental trigger for drowsiness, wherever she is. She also carries a small book of quotes for a screen-free wind down and uses a lavender pillow mist. “I don’t know if it’s a placebo but it works for me,” she says.Junge says that if she is driving she will usually take her own doona and pillow because “it adds another layer of familiarity”.Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningWhile winding down is helpful, Junge says that waking well is just as important. She uses the acronym RISE UP,coined in a 2018 studywhich looked at ways to combat sleep inertia. It stands for Resisting the snooze button, Increasing your physical activity, Showering, Exposing yourself to sunlight, playing Upbeat music and Phoning (or talking to) a friend. All of which the study found helps us shake off sluggishness if we’ve had a rough night.Keep it lightIf you’re travelling through different timezones or into a different climate, Mukherjee says daylight is particularly important and “essential for resetting the body clock”. She suggests resisting the urge to crash on arrival and instead get into the daylight if the sun is still out, no matter how exhausted you are.View image in fullscreenIt is particularly important to get into daylight, if the sun is still out, when travelling through different timezones.Photograph: Halfpoint Images/Getty ImagesHorrifyingly, Mukherjee says that it takes a full day to adjust for every hour of time difference, meaning it will take your body clock 11 days to adjust to the difference between Melbourne and London in December. Apps like Timeshifter can help by incrementally winding your body clock closer to that of your destination.Stay coolThe scientific consensus is that the optimum ambient temperature for sleep is around 17C to 19C. Mukherjee says that as the brain figures out it’s time for bed, a surge in melatonin naturally lowers our body temperature to help initiate and maintain sleep. But stuffy tents or drafty annexes can interrupt that process and, with it, our sleep.Sadly, not every holiday includes climate control, so Mukherjee suggests bringing a few sleepwear options to balance things out. When it comes to your pre-slumber ablutions she says it pays to adjust your temperature to the sleeping environment; if it’s going to be a hot one, have a tepid shower; if the room is freezing, have a nice warm one. “It’s all about bringing your temperature into the range where you can facilitate sleep.”Block the world outView image in fullscreenAn eye mask and ear plugs can be a cheap solution especially as sleep tends to become more sensitive with age.Photograph: Cindy Shebley/Getty ImagesSleep tends to become more sensitive with age, Junge says. She now carries ear plugs and an eye mask because “a couple of bucks spent online, or even just pocketing the complimentary ones from the plane, can make a real difference”.Turn your lullabies offYour screens should go to sleep at least an hour before you do but Mukherjee doesn’t see a problem with using audio to drift off – as long as there’s a sleep timer. She suggests about one hour, as our natural sleep cycles mean every 90 minutes or so we are more susceptible to being woken. If that music, podcast or rainstorm is still going, the chances are your sleep will suffer.Scans shed light on changes in brain when we zone out while tiredRead moreNap if you need itOne of the best things we can do to get the best rest possible while we are away from home is to take the pressure off, Junge says. “Don’t catastrophise! Don’t look at the clock too much and fret.”Junge sees many insomnia patients in her practice and studies people who have naturally good sleep hygiene. She says the best sleepers are people who barely think about it. “The bottom line is to not overthink sleep.”She reminds us that we don’t – or at least shouldn’t – count every calorie or worry about every glass of wine while on holiday. The same should go for sleep.After all, Junge says, “holidays are for relaxing” so leave the optimisation obsession at home, enjoy that extra serve of pasta, thatone moredrink. And if you’ve had a poor sleep, don’t start spiralling, “just have a nap, have a couple of coffees and try to enjoy the day”.Explore more on these topicsSleepSummer essentialsHealth & wellbeingAustralian lifestylefeaturesShareReuse this content"

For weeks, the roads have been jammed with traffic, concerts headlined by Afrobeats superstars are drawing crowds, and choice spots are filled with residents, returnees and tourists looking to indulge in the month-long enjoyment ofDetty December.But the spotlight is on the contents of kitchen pots as much as it is on those shuffling to the trendyOblee dance stepsin clubs and street parties.This Christmas, Olawunmi George and her family of four will celebrate overplates of jollof riceand chicken at their two-bedroom apartment in Yaba, mainland Lagos.The last time the family ate the famed West African meal was in August. Since then, they have stuck to other meals such as spaghetti, rice and stew, bread and eba, among various Nigerian staples.The decision not to eat jollof rice was not out of choice but one necessitated bythe cost of living crisiswracking the economy of Africa’s biggest country.“You will spend a lot for the ingredients to cook jollof rice that will be to your taste,” George, who works as a cashier, says.Jollof rice is beloved across WestAfricawith each country, and each family, having its own ways of preparing it. In Nigeria, it is made with a base of tomato puree, peppers, onions, broth, margarine, curry and thyme, bayleaf and ginger, among other essentials, which is slow-cooked and stirred until the flavours coalesce before rice, often long grain, is introduced to the mix.It is often served with fried plantain and a protein of choice such as turkey, chicken or beef. A true Nigerian staple at parties and family lunch, when jollof rice is served its smoky aroma draws everybody’s attention.View image in fullscreenFood for sale at a stall in Sabo market, Lagos. The rising cost of ingredients means many people are buying less.Photograph: Pelumi SalakoToday, however, the dish is appearing less on the table in Nigerian homes. The cost of preparing a pot for a family of five is 26,656 naira (£13.50), up from 21,300 naira a year ago, according to theJollof Index, a cost of living report prepared by Lagos-based SBM Intelligence, which has tracked the effect of inflation on the dish since 2015. For context, the minimum monthly wage in Nigeria is 70,000 naira.Although inflation has eased for the past few months, down to14.45% from24.48%, this has barely had an impact on people’s buying power. For example, a bag of rice that sold for 120,000 naira in January now costs 65,000 naira, but most people still cannot afford it.Victor Ejechi, the head of insights at SBM Intelligence, says although inflation has slowed, it does not mean things are getting cheaper but that prices are rising more slowly than before.Imagine preparing the food for a family of six, how much do you think I will be spending? And then there is chicken to addMaureen Simon“What the Jollof Index captures is a widening gap between prices and purchasing power. While food inflation has eased, incomes have not adjusted at the same pace. Many Nigerians are earning the same nominal wages they earned months ago, but food now takes up a much larger share of their monthly income than it used to,” Ejechi says.Cooking jollof rice has proved too costly for Maureen Simon, a big fan of the dish.“Imagine preparing the food for a family of six, how much do you think I will be spending? I will be spending roughly 20,000 naira. And then there is chicken to add to it,” she says.She now skips many of the key ingredients such as margarine, the chicken and tomato puree.View image in fullscreenA plate of ‘concoction rice’ – a cheaper alternative to jollof – with chicken.Photograph: Pelumi Salako“I still try to make it taste nice with crayfish. At least, it will come out nice while making do with what I have,” the supermarket supervisor says. She uses panla, a popular cheap smoked fish, instead of chicken or beef, which contributes its own flavour.What she ends up making is an imitation of jollof she calls “concoction rice”, lighter in colour and taste but costs much less and takes less time to prepare.Ozoz Sokoh, a food historian, says cooking concoction rice usually begins with something the cook already has, sometimes leftover stew, and skips the luxury of slow cooking and flavour maximisation.“Overall, the concoction is likely light in colour and a bit on flavour compared with the deeper, richer flavours and notes of jollof,” she says.InGhana, where jollof rice is similarly popular, the cost of making the meal is also proving a burden for families. The Jollof Index places the cost of cooking a pot of jollof rice for a family of five at 430 cedis in a country where the daily minimum wage is 19.97 cedis.Julianna Quist, who used to make the delicacy for her family of four three times a week, now rarely cooks it.“I would rather cook normal rice and stew for the family than decide to cook jollof rice that is not good enough,” she says.The price of plantain, which Quist loves to include in her version of the dish, also went up in September. In November, after saving up, she bought a large quantity of tomatoes to ensure she could prepare the delicacy this December.View image in fullscreenThe price of plantain, which is often served with jollof rice, has also increased.Photograph: Pelumi SalakoThe primary difference between Nigerian and Ghanaian jollof is the kind of rice used. “In Nigeria, parboiled-processed rice is common compared with non-parboiled varieties like Thai jasmine that are popular in Ghana,” says Sokoh. “There are also likely variations in method and the seasoning and spices used.”The Nigerian version is characteristically spicier and bolder.Ghana and Nigeria both claim to serve the bestin an age-old argument which now rages on social media platforms. The latest ensuing after Nigerian chef Hilda Baci attempted toset a Guinness recordfor cooking the largest pot of jollof rice using 4,000kg of rice.“Notions of superiority don’t make sense – personal preference, perhaps, but claims of one version trumping the other on a serious note are ridiculous,” Sokoh says.View image in fullscreenChef Hilda Baci and her team cooking the world’s largest pot of Jollof Rice in Lagos in September.Photograph: Sunday Alamba/APJollof has become enshrined in culture and identity. For many Nigerians, the dish is a core childhood memory. The shift to it becoming a luxury reshapes expectations, traditions, and how people define normalcy, experts say.Ejechi notes that when households cannot cook it freely, it reflects social strain.“The inability to prepare jollof the ‘right way’ erodes everyday cultural rituals: hosting guests, family gatherings, Sunday meals.Foodbecomes transactional rather than communal. Over time, this weakens shared social experiences that bind families and communities together,” he says.Nigerian Jollofrice recipeby Ozoz Sokoh, author ofChop Chop: Cooking the Food of NigeriaStew base:475g plum tomatoes, roughly chopped2 medium red bell peppers, roughly chopped1 medium red onion, roughly chopped1/4 of a Scotch bonnet or habanero pepper355ml Nigerian stockBlend all the ingredients until smooth.

The Department of War executed numerous perfect strikes, as only the United States is capable of doing.”The US military’s Africa Command said the strike was carried out in Sokoto state in coordination with the Nigerian authorities. An earlier statement posted by the command on X said the strike had been conducted at the request of Nigerian authorities, but that statement was later removed. Pentagon chief Pete Hegseth said he was “grateful for Nigerian government support + cooperation”.Nigeria’s foreign ministry said the strikes were carried out as part of ongoing security cooperation with the US, involving intelligence sharing and strategic coordination to target militant groups. “This has led to precision hits on terrorist targets in Nigeria by air strikes in the North West,” the ministry said in a post on X.Trump has previously said he would launch a “guns-a-blazing” US military intervention in Nigeria, claiming that the country’s government hasbeen inadequate in its efforts to prevent attacks on Christiansby Islamist groups.Nigeria is officially a secular country but its population is almost evenly divided between Muslims (53%) and Christians (45%). Violence against Christians has drawn significant international attention, especially among the religious right in America, and it has often been framed as religious persecution.However, Nigeria’s government rejects framing the country’s violence in terms of religious persecution, saying in the past that armed groups target both Muslims and Christians, and US claims that Christians face persecution do not represent a complex security situation and ignore efforts to safeguard religious freedom. But the government has previously agreed to work with the US to bolster its forces against militant groups.Many analystssay the situation is complex and has long roots in the region’s history. In some parts of the country, clashes between itinerant Muslim herders and predominantly Christian farming communities are rooted in competition over land and water.Priests and pastors haveincreasingly been kidnapped for ransom, but some experts say this may be a trend driven by criminal incentives rather than religious discrimination.Trump, who positioned himself as the “candidate of peace” in 2024, campaigned on the promise of extraditing the US from decades of “endless wars”. However his first year back in the White House has been notable for the number of military interventions overseas, with strikes on Yemen, Iran, Syria and others, as well as ahuge military buildupin the Caribbean targeting Venezuela.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationNigeriaDonald TrumpIslamic StateAfricaUS foreign policyUS militarynewsShareReuse this content"

More than 1 million people have been displaced, many of them two, three or even four times.Neither the Mozambican army nor a Rwandan intervention have managed to quell the insurgency, which has ravaged northernMozambiquesince October 2017, when militants from Islamic State-Mozambique, an affiliate of the main IS group in the Middle East, carried out their first attacks, in Mocímboa da Praiain Cabo Delgado province in the north-east.mapThe group drew global attention in March 2021 with anattack on the town of Palma. More than 600 people were killed in the assault and the military’s subsequent recapturing of the town, according toArmed Conflict Location and Event Data, a non-profit conflict monitor, including foreign workers on a multibillion-dollar Total liquefied natural gas (LNG) project.Rwanda, whose military is better equipped and trained than Mozambique’s, deployed 1,000 troops to Cabo Delgado in July 2021, initially pushing back the militants.Rwandanow has an estimated 4,000 to 5,000 military personnel in the country.However, violence against civilians has never fully abated and has increased this year, according to Acled.View image in fullscreenRwandan troops leave for Mozambique to help combat the escalating insurgency.Photograph: Jean Bizimana/ReutersMore than 100,000 people were displaced in November alone, according to theInternational Organization for Migration, after Mozambican and Rwandan operations pushed IS fighters south, where the insurgents made their furthest incursion yet into Nampula province.At the end of November, more than 350,000 people had been displaced, up from to 240,000 a year earlier.Tomás Queface, a researcher for the independent conflict monitor Acled, said the insurgents had been “very audacious”, adding that Rwandan and Mozambican forces were not as “effective as they used to be … The Rwandans are not doing patrols like they used to do.“And more importantly, the government wants the Mozambican forces to take the lead in the conflict and then Rwanda stays in the back,” he said.So far this year, Acled has recorded 549 deaths in 302 attacks, more than half of them civilians. The civilian death toll, at 290, is already 56% higher than last year. Since 2017, almost 2,800 civilians have been killed, 80% by IS and more than 9% by Mozambican forces.Mozambique’s president, Daniel Chapo, who took office in January after hundreds of people werekilled by security forcesfollowing disputed elections,told Al Jazeerain September that he wanted dialogue with the insurgents.View image in fullscreenDaniel Chapo at an election campaign in Maputo, Mozambique, last year.Photograph: José Coelho/EPABorges Nhamirre, a researcher at the Institute for Security Studies, a South African thinktank, said dialogue – including with communities in the underdeveloped region – was the key to resolving the conflict.But he was sceptical: “Most important is not what politicians say but what politicians do. After eight years … there are no effective initiatives of dialogue.”He said much of the military effort was focused on securing the estimated $20bn LNG project, which Total said in October it wouldresume once it received government approval.Nhamirre said: “First you need to ask what [objective] the Rwandan and Mozambican forces had. If it is to guarantee human security, then we can say that they have failed … But if the objective is to secure the LNG project, then they have achieved some success … The LNG project is definitely more secure than in 2021.”View image in fullscreenDisplaced survivors of an attack by IS-linked militants arriving at Pemba port, Mozambique, in April 2021.Photograph: Luis Miguel Fonseca/EPAMeanwhile, IS has beenabducting childrenfor forced labour, marriage, or to fight. In June, Human Rights Watch (HRW) reported that there had beensharp increase in such kidnappings.Sheila Nhancale, a researcher for HRW, said: “The displacement that is happening now is also increasing the risk of sexual violence, exploitation and abuse, particularly for women and children. Of the 100,000 displaced [in November], 70,000 are children.”chartPeople forced to flee are also facing shrinking support. Donors havegiven $195m to the humanitarian responsethis year – only 55% of the estimated need –compared with $246m last year, according to the UN’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.Sebastián Traficante, the head of operations for Médecins Sans Frontières in Mozambique, said displaced people “have to stay in places with very poor conditions, with very poor access to basic services … that are already affected by eight years of conflict.“They just want this to end. They just want to be able to go back to their homes, to do their farming – they want to have a normal life.”Explore more on these topicsMozambiqueIslamic StateRwandaInternally displaced peopleAfricaAidHumanitarian responsenewsShareReuse this content"

Photograph: The Darien Landscape Collection by Oyvind Martinsen/AlamyLow-cost tech and joined-up funding have reduced illegal logging, mining and poaching in the Darién Gap – it’s a success story that could stop deforestation worldwideByLuke TaylorThu 25 Dec 2025 10.00 ESTShareThere are no roads through the Darién Gap. This vast impenetrable forest spans the width of the land bridge between South and Central America, but there is almost no way through it: hundreds have lost their lives trying to cross it on foot.Its size and hostility have shielded it from development for millennia, protecting hundreds of species – from harpy eagles and giant anteaters to jaguars and red-crested tamarins – in one of the most biodiverse places on Earth. But it has also made it incredibly difficult to protect. Looking after 575,000 hectares (1,420,856 acres) of beach, mangrove and rainforest with just 20 rangers often felt impossible, says Segundo Sugasti, the director of Darién national park. Like tropical forests all over the world, it has been steadily shrinking, with at least 15% lost to logging, mining and cattle ranching in two decades.But in the past three years, Panama has mounted a surprising fightback that couldoffer hopeto the rest of the world’s forests. In 2022, the government took a hard line ondeforestationand modernised its park ranger force, partnered with the NGO Global Conservation and deforestation in the park began to fall. That fall accelerated when President José Raúl Mulino took office in July 2024.Mulino purged the environment ministry of corrupt officials and introduced a blanket moratorium on logging to stop companies exploiting indigenous logging permits. The park ranger force was expanded with 30 new recruits and 11 forestry officers, swelling numbers from six to more than 40. The number of patrols has grown from almost zero in 2022 to 55 in 2024, with more than 150 expected in 2025.View image in fullscreenPanama’s president, José Raúl Mulino, has taken a hard line on deforestation.Photograph: Enea Lebrun/Reuters“People don’t look at us the same way any more,” Sugasti says. “Now the kids are asking when they can sign up to become a ranger!”In an era when cash-strapped governments are slashing environmental budgets, Jeff Morgan, the director of GlobalConservation, which partners with the park, says: “It’s a miracle.”“I’ve been in this industry for more than 10 years and worked in 22 countries. I’ve never seen anything like this,” he says.Global Conservation supported the park with new trucks, boats, food and fuel, giving the rangers the tools and confidence to reach areas they once avoided. “Now if we have to go by boat, by truck or by foot, we will go there – no matter how far it is. As long as we feel safe and supported, we will do it,” says Esquivel Ramires, a park ranger.‘We’re true guardians of the forest’: quilombola community near Belém demand land rights and recognitionRead moreThe other significant shift has been in the use of technology. With little phone signal in the rainforest, rangers used to spend much of their time incommunicado, chasing ghosts. By the time alerts of intruders clearing trees reached them, they had already vanished. Rangers have now been given access to cameras, satellites and cloud systems, starting with Elon Musk’s Starlink, and are in constant communication with one another, allowing for a quicker, more coordinated response.Sugasti says: “Before, sending a park ranger to remote zones meant risking their life. Now I can send them to the most far-flung corners quickly, knowing they are safe.”Trail cameras automatically detect movements of logging crews and all officers use EarthRanger – a cloud-based park management system that allows them to share photos, GPS locations and incident reports immediately. If a fire is reported inside the park, they can immediately pinpoint the location of the blaze.The platform also links to external sources such as Global Forest Watch’s real-time fire-detection satellites. No fires took hold in the park in 2024 or 2025, Segasti says.In the past, one or two rangers might have arrived late and alone, now teams of five can be rapidly dispatched together. As a result, the team’s presence is more visible and feared and loggers and miners are retreating.“Illegal mining, the poaching of animals and logging is happening a lot less. They are scared of us now,” says ranger Juan Sebuygera, wearing his green standard-issue, wide-brimmed hat.Most remarkable is that the tech is neither costly nor complex, says Kherson Rodríguez, who manages the Darién project for Global Conservation. EarthRanger and Global Forest Watch’s real-time fire alerts are free: all rangers need is access to Starlink and smartphones.Wider financial support also meant five rusting boat engines that had not been serviced for a decade could be repaired.“Before, [rangers] were not able to do their jobs because they lacked basics like oil, fuel or replacement parts. It is [about] being efficient and giving them what they need, when they need it,” Rodríguez says.The results have been staggering. Forest loss inside the national park plummeted by 88% between 2022 and 2025, reaching its lowest level in 20 years, according to Global Forest Watch. So far this year, logging in the park has fallen to nearly zero, the park says.The reclaiming of Darién national park should help protect one of the region’s largest carbon sinks and the Indigenous groups and many animal species that live there. It also comes as tropical forests across Central America are collapsing.“Nicaragua is gone. Mexico, Guatemala – everything is going now. If you look from Google Earth we are down to these little green patches. It’s the last 10% of what was there 100 years ago. So if we don’t get it right real soon …” Morgan says, trailing off, preferring not to elaborate on the implications of losing the greatest intact rainforest north of the Amazon.Tropical forest loss doubled in 2024,reaching the highest level recorded in two decades.Bringing park rangers who still work with pens and notepads into the age of cameras, tablets and cloud computing is a pragmatic way to turn the tide when climate diplomacy at summits like Cop is failing, Morgan says.He says Panama’s turnaround also shows how co-investment – partnering with governments that also invest in conservation – makes rangers more accountable and brings better results. And it is also quicker.“It takes three years to get a USAID or a Defra grant. You do a ton of paperwork, and by the time it’s ready, the government has changed, the president’s now terrible, the park directors are terrible. Everything can be destroyed in that time,” Morgan says.Instead of waiting on climate finance, there should be a push for direct co-investment with governments, Morgan says. “This is just one park. Imagine the difference we could make with just $200,000 a year, times 1,000 parks,” he says.Explore more on these topicsThe alternativesPanamaAmericasDeforestationAmazon rainforestConservationTrees and forestsnewsShareReuse this content"

The groups have spent the best part of a decade knitting together apatchwork of land purchases and state-held propertiesto create the park.In 2023, they signed an agreement with the Chilean government to donate the land to become Cape Froward national park.In February, a population of 10 huemul, an endangered deer species, was found in the park, and a network of cameras regularly captures wild pumas and the endangered huillín, a river otter. The area also encompasses 10,000 hectares of sphagnum bogs, a spongelike moss which stores carbon deep below the ground.View image in fullscreenA waterfall in the strait of Magellan, which links the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.Photograph: Pablo Sanhueza/ReutersBenjamín Cáceres, the conservation coordinator in the Magallanes region forRewildingChile, is a native of Patagonia who first visited Cape Froward at the age of 12 with his conservationist father, Patricio Cáceres.“My father was always a dreamer,” he said. “When he found out about an abandoned lighthouse all those years ago, he brought us here as a family to dream with him – and that’s where this story began for me.”The San Isidro lighthouse is one of seven designed and built by the Scottish architect George Slight along the treacherous strait of Magellan. It was abandoned in the 1970s and itinerant fishers would come by to salvage wood until the roof collapsed.Now, Patricio and Benjamín’s vision for the restored lighthouse is becoming a reality. It has been converted into a museum of the natural and human history of the area and – together with a cafe on the beach below – will become the entry point for the new national park.View image in fullscreenGabriela Garrido, project coordinator for the Rewilding Foundation, which secured the land for the Cape Froward project.Photograph: Pablo Sanhueza/ReutersDotted along the shoreline are delicate archaeological sites that enshrine the history of the Kawésqar, a nomadic Indigenous people who navigated fjords, rocky beaches and forests in canoes carved from trees.“This mosaic of ecosystems is tremendously important,” said Cáceres. “The bogs and subantarctic forests are incredibly fragile, and the cultural legacy of the Kawésqar territory, the era of explorers, then whalers; all of this history and biodiversity will be preserved in some form in the future national park.”In among shells buried in silty mud at Kawésqar campsites are bird and dolphin bones from feasts. There are even circles of stones set out as fish traps on the beaches, and trees stripped of their bark to line the hulls of Kawésqar canoes.View image in fullscreenThe southern Chilean coastline is dotted with archaeological sites that tell the history of the Kawésqar people.Photograph: Pablo Sanhueza/Reuters“The area was widely inhabited by nomadic canoeists who lived by fishing and gathering food,” said Leticia Caro, a Kawésqar activist who belongs to the Nómades del Mar community. “For our community, it is very important to protect this area, where you can also see the different ways of inhabiting the land and seas, and the interaction with other peoples like theYagán, Selknam and Tehuelche.”Long after Indigenous communities had settled in the area, the waters of the strait of Magellan, which the Kawésqar call thetawokser chams, became the link between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Charles Darwin stepped off the Beagleto climb nearby Mount Tarn on his voyage along the coast of Chile and the strait was one of the world’s most important shipping routes until the Panama canal opened in 1914.The murky depths have claimed many lives and spawned legends. Treasure troves lie in the depths, and sealed bottles of rum have washed ashore over the centuries.Timber from the forests has been taken as far afield as the Falkland Islands and Buenos Aires for construction and, in 1905, the Magallanes Whaling Society was formed. Eleven years later, with the whale population decimated, an auction was held to sell off the society’s land and equipment.All that is left at Bahía el Águila, where the carcasses were processed, is the footprint of the factory and a few rotting wooden stumps. Adolf Andresen, the society’s Norwegian founder, died poor and forgotten in the saloon bars of Punta Arenas in 1940.View image in fullscreenThe forest covered by the Cape Froward project is home to endangered deer and otter species as well as wild pumas.Photograph: Pablo Sanhueza/ReutersBut there are still a number of steps before the national park officially comes into existence.An Indigenous consultation process, a legal requirement for large-scale projects in Chile, was held in September but fell flat. Chile’s environment ministry said it would make “every effort” to advance with plans for the park by March.But if no progress is made after two years, the lands revert to the ownership of Tompkins’ organisations.“Each of the park projects we have developed has specific reasons for being considered essential for conservation,” said Tompkins, who was the chief executive of Patagonia outdoor clothing for 20 years until 1993. “And in this sense Cape Froward is a piece of an ecological puzzle that, over time, should ensure that key biodiversity sites within Chilean Patagonia are permanently protected.”The Guardian’s reporting was supported by Rewilding ChileExplore more on these topicsChileRewildingConservationWildlifeAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Heavy rain, storms and strong winds were easing as the category 1 cyclone moved westwards.Perth reached 41.9C on Thursday afternoon with an extreme fire danger warning in place for much of south-west Western Australia for Christmas.At Boddington goldmine in the Peel region, south-west of Perth, the WA Department of Fire and Emergency Services (DFES) was advising residents it was too late to late.“You are in danger and need to act immediately to survive. There is a threat to lives and homes.”A wider watch and act warning was in place in the surrounding area.Bradbury said the heat would begin to ease on Friday. “Today is the last day of the intense heat for now for the west coast,” she said.A flood watch was in place for much of northern Australia on Thursday across WA, the Northern Territory and Queensland. Brisbane was facing a hot, dry start, with showers and possible storms and a high of 33C.

Those activists were convicted earlier this month and handed sentences ranging from 16 to 22 years in prison.Udaltsov has rejected the charges against him as fabricated. On Thursday, he denounced the verdict as “shameful” and said he was going on a hunger strike, Mediazona reported.According to the court ruling, the activist will be serving his sentence in a maximum security penal colony.Udaltsov was a prominent opposition figure during the 2011-12 mass protests in Russia, triggered by reports of widespread rigging of a parliamentary election. In February 2012, he took part in a meeting that then president Dmitry Medvedev held with various opposition figures.Russian authorities have ramped up their crackdown on dissent and free speech after the Kremlin sent troops into Ukraine, relentlessly targeting rights groups, independent media, members of civil society organizations, LGBTQ+ activists and some religious groups. Hundreds of people have been jailed and thousands of others have fled the country.In December 2023, a Moscow court sentenced Udaltsov to 40 hours of compulsory labor for violating procedures relating to organizing a rally after he was detained on Red Square, where he tried to unfurl a flag with the image of Soviet dictator Josef Stalin, according to Russia’s state news agency Tass.Udaltsov was previously imprisoned in 2014 and sentenced to 4.5 years on charges related to his role in organizing a 2012 demonstration against Putin that turned turbulent. He was released in 2017.Explore more on these topicsRussiaVladimir PutinEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

It is caused by a change in one or more genes and mostly passed on through families.Some feel fine most of the time and have few or no symptoms. But others can suffer complications, such as heart failure and abnormal heart rhythms, which can lead to a cardiac arrest.The problem is there is no cure. Doctors alsodo not know which patientswith the genetic condition are most at risk from deadly complications.But now a team of scientists from universities including Harvard and Oxford have found a way to forecast risk for people living with HCM.The blood test could identify those patients most in danger of complications, enabling them to be monitored more closely or receive life-saving treatment.In a landmark study, the team measured the levels of a protein, N-terminal Pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-Pro-BNP), in the blood of 700 HCM patients.NT-Pro-BNP is released by the heart as part of normal pumping. But high levels are a sign the heart is working too hard. Those with the highest levels had poorer blood flow, more scar tissue and changes in their heart which could lead to atrial fibrillation or heart failure.A blood test measuring NT-Pro-BNP could transform the care of millions of people with the world’s most common inherited heart condition.The study leader, Prof Carolyn Ho, the medical director of the cardiovascular genetics centre at Harvard medical school, said the test could help “target the right therapies to the right patients at the right time”.She added: “Continued studies on blood biomarkers will lead to better understanding of HCM so that, in future, we can offer our patients a blood test to identify who is at high versus low risk of experiencing serious consequences of the disease.“People with the highest risk could be targeted for potentially life-saving treatments as they stand to receive the greatest benefit, while those at lowest risk could avoid unnecessary treatment.”Lara Johnson, 34, from Southampton in the UK, is one of many who could benefit.Parasite cleanses: why are so many people obsessed with intestinal worms?Read moreEight years ago, she began experiencing breathlessness and fatigue. After being referred by her GP for hospital tests, she was diagnosed with HCM. Several relatives on her father’s side were subsequently also diagnosed with the condition.“One of the hardest parts of living with HCM is the constant uncertainty, never knowing what might change next,” Johnson said. “A simple blood test, which could help identify future risks earlier, would take away so much of that anxiety.”She added: “It could give people like me a chance to prepare and adjust our lifestyles as needed, and help us to feel more in control. That kind of clarity wouldn’t only help me, it would make a world of difference for my whole family.”Prof Bryan Williams, the chief scientific and medical officer of the British Heart Foundation, which funded the research, said the test “could benefit patients around the world”.“After a diagnosis of HCM, patients and their families want to know what the future holds. This study shows that measuring various proteins circulating in the blood could help predict how the heart is functioning and future risk of complications from heart disease.“This new method may also provide insights in the evolution of the structure and function of the heart in people with HCM that could point to new ways of treating this condition to reduce future risk.”Explore more on these topicsHealthHeart diseaseHarvard UniversityUniversity of OxfordMedical researchEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Hastings residents were left without water for four days in May 2024 after a pipe burst, which was flagged for replacement in 2007 but never fixed. Multiple pipes in the Hastings area have previously been listed by the company as “aged assets prone to failure”.A bottled water station in Pelham Place car park on Carlisle Parade in Hastings was open until 10pm on Christmas Day.Southern Water has deployed a fleet of tankers to inject water into the network and the reservoir, saying: “This process takes time, but we’re already seeing gradual improvements.”The problems are expected to be “temporary”, the supplier said, adding: “If you do have water, please use it responsibly, as reservoir levels remain low and demand is very high.”Helena Dollimore, the Labour MP for Hastings and Rye, said: “I’m angry that Hastings once again is paying the price for the failures of Southern Water.“Our town’s water infrastructure is not fit for purpose after years of neglect, and Southern Water must do better.“I am pushing Southern Water to get us back in supply as quickly as possible and minimise the impact on residents by supplying bottled water and opening plenty of water stations.“I’m also asking them to supply extra water to our pubs and restaurants who are particularly busy at this time of year. Once we are through this incident, Southern Water must get their act together.“After a major five-day water outage last May when the same pipe burst, and an environmental disaster last month when millions of plastic beads escaped their wastewater plant, we cannot endure any more.”Explore more on these topicsEast SussexWater industryEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

The missing men are aged in their 40s and 60s.Det Supt Hayley Costar, of Devon and Cornwall Police, said: “As dark falls, a number of these searches have been stood down, with some police enquiries on land continuing this evening.“There have been weather warnings in place this week and a number of official and unofficial swims have already been cancelled.“While there are no official warnings in place for tomorrow, we urge anyone with plans to go swimming in the sea on Boxing Day not to.”In a statement, the Coastguard said its search was stood down at 5pm.A spokesperson said: “Alerted at around 10am, Exmouth and Beer coastguard rescue teams, RNLI lifeboats from Exmouth, Teignmouth and Torbay, coastguard search and rescue helicopters and fixed wing aircraft were sent to the scene to assist, alongside police and ambulance service.“Searches have continued throughout the day to find two men believed to still be in the water. After extensive shoreline and offshore searches, the coastguard part of the search was stood down at 5pm.”A number of Christmas and Boxing Day swims in Devon and Cornwall were cancelled this year because of a yellow weather warning for wind.The Met Office warned of “strong and gusty east to northeasterly winds” from 4am until 11.59pm on Christmas Day in parts of the south-west of England and Wales.It said peak gusts would reach 45 to 55mph but these could reach 55 to 65mph along some exposed coasts and to the west of prominent hills.Disruption could be caused to transport and power supplies, the forecaster said.It added: “Large waves will be an additional hazard on some coasts.”Anyone with information which may assist in the search for the swimmers should contact Devon and Cornwall police by calling 101 or through the force’s website, quoting log number 191 of 25 December.Explore more on these topicsUK newsDevonnewsShareReuse this content"

That is half a million more than last year, according to analysis by the research company GlobalData for Vouchercodes.co.uk.A Chocolate Orange has doubled in price – and got smaller. Why?Read moreHigh streets and other shopping centres are expected to record a 1.5% rise in sales on Boxing Day compared with last year, ahead of the 0.6% pace of shop price inflation, according to the latest British Retail Consortium figures. That is less than half the 3.4% growth expected in online sales, according to GlobalData.Kien Tan at the advisory firm PwC said Boxing Day could benefit from a more lacklustreBlack Fridaysales period this year, during which retailers were disappointed by demand as shoppers held out for better bargains.“There are signs are that Black Friday has peaked in the UK and there will still be people looking for bargains on Boxing Day. It’s not necessarily a comeback but it’s still there – a British institution.”He said the hunt for bargains came as shoppers were feeling more cautious than a year ago as there was “a lot more uncertainty and people are holding back”.Tan said online shopping was on the rise again, driven by busy middle-aged people rather than fashion shoppers. They are likely to be ready to spend more on furniture and other gadgets for the home in the post-Christmas sales as it is now five years since the pandemic fuelled a boom in spending on home improvements, so many goods bought at that time are becoming worn out.Before Christmas, there were signs that shoppers were holding off on purchases. On Christmas Eve, fashion retailers launched early discounts after a mild autumn and winter for much of the country held back sales of knitwear and coats. New Look, Boohoo and Sports Direct all offered discounts of up to 70%, and Next, John Lewis and Topshop offered 50% off.Visitor numbers were down 4.5% on Tuesday compared with 23 December last year, according to the retail footfall measuring firm MRI as a bounceback in cities including London was offset by poor numbers in towns and shopping centres. Footfall recovered some ground on Christmas Eve, up 0.4% on a year earlier.Moji Oshisanya, the chief commercial officer of VoucherCodes.co.uk, said: “The uplift in sales over the Boxing Day sales period is driven by two key factors. We’re seeing a resurgence in appetite for the Boxing Day sales, with shopper numbers forecast to be at their highest level in four years – a healthy 105.2 million [over a week]. The Boxing Day sales are often a moment for consumers to treat themselves post-Christmas, and with finances tight, the deals and discounts available will be used to stretch budgets further.“However, increased participation isn’t the only driver: inflation is also to blame. Over the wider six-week Christmas period, from mid-November to the end of December, sales value is expected to grow by 3.2%, yet sales volume is forecast to fall by 0.3%. This indicates that while people are spending more, driving up overall sales figures, they won’t necessarily be taking home more items.”Boxing Day now vies with 27 December for the busiest shopping day post-Christmas and that will be particularly true this year as the 27th is a Saturday, so many people will be off work.About 44% of consumers say they plan to hit the high streets from Boxing Day onwards, with 29% heading to retail parks and 22% expecting to visit big shopping centres, according to MRI.High street spending has come under pressure in recent years as some big retailers – including most John Lewis outlets, Aldi, Poundland, B&Q, Next and large Marks & Spencer stores, remain closed on Boxing Day.With family structures more diverse, many households also enjoy several celebratory meals in different locations, while public transport shutdowns can hold up trade on the traditional start to the post-Christmas sales.Explore more on these topicsRetail industryChristmasConsumer spendingEconomicsBlack FridaynewsShareReuse this content"

Since its introduction, neither the uptake nor the length of paternal leave taken has increased, said researchers. The last Conservative government’s 2023evaluation of SPLfound that only 1% of eligible mothers and 5% of eligible fathers used it.Chart showing statutory shared parental payA growing body of evidence also suggests that shared parental leave has become the preserve of higher earners concentrated in the south-east of England. Analysis of HMRC data by campaign group the Dad Shift, reveals that 95% of shared parental leave in 2024-25 was claimed byfathers in the UK’s top half of earners, those making more than the average salary of £37,800 a year.HMRC datareveals a consistent decline in the share of SPL going to the bottom 50% of earners almost every year since it was created. While around one in 10 claims for shared parental leave were made by average- or low-paid dads in 2015, the figure is now closer to one in 20.Chart shows share of payments going to the bottom half of earners is in decline“A lost decade on, it’s clear shared parental leave is good for a handful of wealthier families in the south-east but just doesn’t work for most working fathers and non-birthing parents,” said George Gabriel, co-founder of the Dad Shift.“In the past decade, who gets time with their new babies has become a clear class issue, with normal blokes priced out of those early weeks and months with their babies, despite a mountain of evidence showing that proper paternity leave is not just good for dads, but mums and babies too.”Wanna hear the one about the low-paid dad who took paternity leave?Read moreThe government’slaunch of an 18-month reviewof the UK’s parental leave system in July was hailed as a “watershed moment” by the House of Commons women and equalities select committee, but MPs warned that “tinkering around the edges of a broken system will let down working parents”.The minister for employment rights, Kate Dearden, acknowledged the current “parental leave system needs improving” and pointed to the review and to measures in the workers’ rights bill that will make paternity leave a day-one right. “No parent should feel they cannot spend meaningful time with their children, and supporting them to do so is essential,” she said.Swinson said a key problem with the current policy was the requirement for women to “give up” some of their maternity leave, and a lack of ringfenced time for dads to spend with their children, and urged the government to implement “take it or leave it” time off work for dads.“The government has to be bold,” she said. “Let’s not have an incremental tweak. Let’s recognise that this hasn’t moved for 10 years – we need a leap at this point.”Baroness JoJo Penn, who worked with Theresa May on the introduction of the policy from 2010, and sought anamendment to Labour’s flagship workers’ rights billto increase statutory paternity leave from two to six weeks at 90% of a father’s salary, said: “Ten years on, it’s clear shared parental leave is not delivering on its original aims. Around half a million new parents every year shouldn’t have to wait to be able to have both parents access proper leave when they have a baby.”“The case for change is overwhelming, and at the moment I worry that the government has another year for its review but we won’t get any real change at the end of it,” she said.Explore more on these topicsMaternity & paternity rightsParents and parentingFamilyJo SwinsonEmployee benefitsnewsShareReuse this content"

But the courage and sacrifice of our servicemen and women, and the way communities came together in the face of such great challenge, carry a timeless message for us all.Princesses Eugenie and Beatrice join royal family for Christmas Day serviceRead more“These are the values which have shaped our country and the Commonwealth. As we hear of division, both at home and abroad, they are the values of which we must never lose sight.”In the wake of the Bondi beach shooting and the Manchester synagogue attack, Charles also praised the “spontaneous bravery” of those who put themselves in “harm’s way to defend others”.The king referenced the impact new technologies can have on wellbeing and community cohesion as the world spins “ever faster”, suggesting the festive period might be a moment to recharge and for those communities to grow stronger.The annual broadcast is written by the king and is the rare occasion when he does not consult government.King Charles is said to see his role as helping to build bridges between communities, faith groups and others – seeking to portray himself a part of society, not apart from it.He praised the qualities of “resilience in the face of adversity; peace through forgiveness; simply getting to know our neighbours and, by showing respect to one another, creating new friendships”.He added: “Indeed, as our world seems to spin ever faster, our journeying may pause, to quieten our minds – in TS Eliot’s words ‘at the still point of the turning world’ – and allow our souls to renew.“In this, with the great diversity of our communities, we can find the strength to ensure that right triumphs over wrong,” he said, adding that people “need to cherish the values of compassion and reconciliation”.The broadcast showed Charles at Heaton Park synagogue in Manchester, where he visited survivors of the October terror attack and met those who blocked the doors as a knife-wielding assailant tried to get in.An arch in Sydney, in Australia, with the words Bondi beach was seen in footage followed by hundreds of floral tributes left after two gunmen targeted a Jewish festival, killing 15 people.The widely acclaimed hero of the massacre, the Syrian-born immigrant Ahmed al-Ahmed, was shot after wrestling a firearm from one of the gunmen.View image in fullscreenThe king visiting the Heaton Park synagogue in Manchester after the October terror attack.Photograph: Christopher Furlong/Getty ImagesAn aide to the king said: “I think his majesty hopes that, if nothing else, Christmas might afford a moment when people could experiment with something of a digital detox to focus more on our friendships, our families and our faith for those who practise.“In this way, the king hopes our minds may find greater peace, our souls can renew, and our communities grow stronger.”The fall of Prince Andrew – a timelineRead moreThe address, recorded on 11 December in Westminster Abbey’s Lady Chapel, made no reference to Charles’s recent “good news” announcement about reducing his cancer treatment, reflecting his wish for his message to mirror society’s experiences during the past 12 months.There was a strong religious element in the address to the nation and Commonwealth from the king; of which the key theme was pilgrimage, and he emphasised the biblical journeys made by Mary and Joseph, arriving “homeless” in Bethlehem, and the three wise men and shepherds to pay homage to the baby Jesus.The king said: “Journeying is a constant theme of the Christmas story. The holy family made a journey to Bethlehem and arrived homeless without proper shelter.“The wise men made a pilgrimage from the east to worship at the cradle of Christ; and the shepherds journeyed from field to town in search of Jesus, the saviour of the world. In each case, they journeyed with others, and relied on the companionship and kindness of others. Through physical and mental challenge, they found an inner strength.”Explore more on these topicsKing Charles IIIMonarchyChristmasTelevisionChristianityCommunitiesnewsShareReuse this content"

Musktried unsuccessfullyto sue the organisation last year before calling it a “criminal organisation”.Ahmed is one of five Europeanstargeted by the US state departmentin the past week. They have been accused of leading efforts to pressure technology firms to censor or suppress American viewpoints.Rubio accused the five – who also include the former EU commissioner Thierry Breton – of leading “organised efforts to coerce American platforms to censor, demonetise and suppress American viewpoints they oppose”.Sarah Rogers, an official at the state department,posted on X: “Our message is clear: if you spend your career fomenting censorship of American speech, you’re unwelcome on American soil.”The sanctions are beingseen as the latest attack on European regulationsthat target hate speech and misinformation. Campaigners in the UK have warned the British government could be targeted further if the Trump administration steps up its attacks on tech regulation.In a statement, Ahmed said: “My life’s work is to protect children from the dangers of unregulated social media and AI and fight the spread of antisemitism online. That mission has pitted me against big tech executives – and Elon Musk in particular – multiple times.“I am proud to call the United States my home. My wife and daughter are American, and instead of spending Christmas with them, I am fighting to prevent my unlawful deportation from my home country.”Roberta Kaplan, Ahmed’s legal counsel, added: “The state department’s actions here are unjustified and blatantly unconstitutional.“Imran is proud to call the United States his home.

Musk has also called for the GDI to be shut down over its criticism of rightwing websites for spreading disinformation.A British government spokesperson said: “While every country has the right to set its own visa rules, we support the laws and institutions which are working to keep the internet free from the most harmful content.”On Thursday evening, a US district judge granted Ahmed a temporary restraining order preventing Rubio and others “from arresting or detaining the plaintiff pending further order of the court”.Ahmed and Kaplan both welcomed the move, with Kaplan saying the order had been granted so quickly “because it is so obvious that Marco Rubio and the other defendants’ actions were blatantly unconstitutional … We look forward to the hearing before the court on Monday.”Explore more on these topicsFreedom of speechTrump administrationElon MuskInternetXUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

The jackpot had a lump sum cash payment option of $834.9m.“Congratulations to the newest Powerball jackpot winner! This is truly an extraordinary, life-changing prize,” Matt Strawn, Powerball Product Group chair and Iowa Lottery CEO, was quoted as saying by the website. “We also want to thank all the players who joined in this jackpot streak – every ticket purchased helps support public programs and services across the country.”The prize followed 46 consecutive drawings in which no one matched all six numbers.The last drawing with a jackpot winner was on 6 September, when players in Missouri and Texas won $1.787bn.The last time someone won a Powerball jackpot on Christmas Eve was in 2011, Powerball said. The company added that the sweepstakes also has been won on Christmas Day four times, most recently in 2013.Powerball’s odds of 1 in 292.2m are designed to generate big jackpots, with prizes growing as they roll over when no one wins. Lottery officials note that the odds are far better for the game’s many smaller prizes.“With the prize so high, I just bought one kind of impulsively. Why not?” Indianapolis glass artist Chris Winters said on Wednesday.Tickets cost $2, and the game is offered in 45 states plus Washington DC, Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands.Explore more on these topicsArkansasNational lotterynewsShareReuse this content"

And at present there is no more morbid phenomenon than the crisis of legitimacy for the networks of rules and laws on which the international order was based – the world that the US was central in creating in 1945.No one can say they were not warned about the wrecking ball that was about to be inflicted on the global order byDonald Trump.The US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, spelled out with admirable clarity in his Senate confirmation hearing in February how Trump disowned the world his predecessors had made. “The postwar global order is not just obsolete, it is now a weapon being used against us,” he said. “And all this has led us to a moment in which we must now confront the single greatest risk of geopolitical instability and generational global crisis in the lifetime of anyone alive here today.”The rules-based international order had to be jettisoned, Rubio said, because it had been built on a false assumption that a foreign policy serving core national interests could be replaced by one that served the “liberal world order, that all the nations of earth would become members of the democratic western-led community”, with humankind now destined to abandon national identity and become “one human family and citizens of the world. This was not just a fantasy. We now know it was a dangerous delusion”.View image in fullscreenMarco Rubio at his Senate confirmation hearing.Photograph: Graeme Sloan/EPARubio’s assessment wasechoed in the recent US national security strategy, with its warnings of European cultural erasure and determination to back nationalist parties that believe in “strategic stability with Russia”. The US would no longer seek to “prop up the entire world order like Atlas”, the document said.On paper these sound like relatively coherent statements of “America first”, but in practice Trump’s foreign policy is a mass of confusion in which this formal non-interventionist ideology has clashed with sporadic interventions that uneasily blend notions of global order with the US national interest. There is no linear Trump foreign policy, just a catherine wheel of disconnected explosions thrown out across the night sky. As Donald Trump Jr asserts, as if it were a virtue, his father is the most unpredictable man in politics. The hugely personal nature ofUS foreign policygives Washington’s erstwhile allies just enough false hope that the break with America is not real.Amid this chaos there has been one consistent target for Trump’s contempt: the constraints imposed by international law, and its value system built around national sovereignty, including the prohibition of the use of force to change external borders. In its place Trump pursues “sheer coercive power” – or what has been described as mobster diplomacy, in which shakedowns, blackmail and deal-making are the agents of change.Trump and Putin share a craving for status. That’s why they both want to destroy Europe | Henry Farrell and Sergey RadchenkoRead moreFaced with the choice, for example, between expelling Russia from Ukraine – something the US undoubtedly has the military means to do by arming Kyiv sufficiently – or forging a profitable relationship with Vladimir Putin in which both sides plunder Ukraine’s considerable material resources, Trump unmistakably wants to choose the latter. Ukraine, it emerges, shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, in order to assure the survival and the success of the Trumpian economy. For the EU and Nato this is indeed the moment when every act has the potential to be decisive for the future sovereignty of Europe and the UN charter.Similarly the sovereignty of Venezuela,sitting on 303bn barrels of crude oil– about a fifth of the world’s reserves – becomes, like that of Greenland, Canada and Mexico, the subject of Trump’s marauding eye. Warned on social media that killing Venezuelan civilians without any due process – as the US has done by bombing numerous boats in the Caribbean and Pacific – would be described a war crime, the US vice-president, JD Vance,was brazen enough to reply “I don’t give a shit what you call it”. The Pentagon has subsequently claimed implausibly that it was permissible in US law to blow up shipwrecked sailors stranded in the water because they were combatants representing a threat to US security.Meanwhile, the rules of free trade are shredded as Trump deploys the sheer size of the US market to extort not just money from allies, but changes in their domestic policy. A country’s standing in the White House is not judged by any rational criteria, let alone its democratic status, but on a leader’s personal relationship to Trump and his ruling clique – a blatantly monarchical order.View image in fullscreenQatar’s foreign policy adviser, Majed al-Ansari (left).Photograph: Noushad Thekkayil/EPAFinally, Israel’s occupation and bombardment of Gaza, with European powers often complicit bystanders, is brutal in itself but also strips bare the supposed universality of international norms. In the words of Majed al-Ansari, the foreign policy adviser to Qatar’s prime minister and a man who has had more dealings with Israel than most in 2025: “We are living in an age of disgusting impunity that is taking us back hundreds of years. We are reduced to giving concession after concession not to stop acts of aggression, but to ask those responsible to kill fewer people, destroy fewer neighbourhoods. We do not even ask them to have respect for international law, but ask to take a step back from going 100 miles away from international law.”All this has been accompanied by an open assault on the institutions of international law that stand in the way of coercive power. Nicolas Guillou, a French judge at the international criminal court, recently gave an interview to Le Monde in which he spelled out the impact ofUS sanctions imposed on him in Augustas a result of the ICC’sissuing an arrest warrant against Benjamin Netanyahufor crimes against humanity.The sanctions have changed every aspect of his daily life. Guillou explained: “All my accounts with American companies, such as Amazon, Airbnb, PayPal and others, have been closed. For example, I booked a hotel in France through Expedia, and a few hours later, the company sent me an email cancelling the reservation, citing the sanctions.”For having the temerity to uphold the basics of international humanitarian law and the value of the lives of Palestinian civilians at the international court, which deals with issues such as war crimes and genocide, Guillou said he had in effect been sent back to live in the 1990s. European banks, cowed by the threats of US Treasury officials in Washington, rushed to close his accounts. The compliance departments of European companies, acting as the valets of the US authorities, refused to provide him services.Meanwhile, European institutions – even signatories to the Rome statute that established the international court in 2002 – look the other way. Major Palestinian human rights groups such as Al-Haq also find their bank accounts closed as they face sanctions for cooperating with the ICC. The judges at the international court of justice, the UN body that deals with intergovernmental disputes, have had to take evasive action to prevent their assets being seized.The US has left or sought to undermine several other UN bodies, such as the Human Rights Council and Unesco. In total it is estimated to have cut $1bn (£750m) in funding for organisations linked to the UN and fired 1,000 US government staff whose portfolios reinforced major UN functions.At the UN general assembly, the key site ofthis year’s disputes between the US and the rest of the world, the US almost relishes its isolation. Other multilateral institutions – the World Trade Organization, the Paris climate agreement structure, the G20 – have become zones of conflict, places where the US can assert its dominance or indifference, either by absenting itself or demanding humiliating fealty from its one-time allies. John Kerry, a former US secretary of state, said that under Trump the US was turning “from leader to denier, delayer and divider”.“When the United States walks away, old excuses find new life. China not only enjoys newfound freedom from scrutiny,” Kerry said: it slowly fills the gap left by the US departure.Washington’s turning away from international law and its institutions is especially sad because, as Dr Tor Krever, an assistant professor of international law at the University of Cambridge, points out, with Gaza “the language of legality has become the dominant frame of popular and political discourse”.In a special edition of the London Review of International Law, more than 40 academics have written essays discussing whether this sudden public faith in international law as a harbinger of justice is a load that the law has the capacity to bear. Law cannot be a substitute for politics or settle ideological conflicts in a polarised world. Prof Gerry Simpson, the chair of public international law at the LSE, said he needed to swallow his longstanding doubts about international law’s efficacy “in the face of the enormous faith that had been placed on it, especially by the young”.View image in fullscreenIllustration: Brian StaufferThe inability to meet new public expectations has led to what Prof Thomas Skouteris, the dean of the law college at the University of Khorfakkan, UAE, describes as “afinde sièclemood” about international law. Writing in the Leiden Journal of International Law, he argues: “International law’s lexicon – sovereignty, genocide, aggression – has become almost ambient, saturating the political atmosphere with juridical resonance. But ubiquity brings a strange paradox. The more present international law appears, the less decisive it feels. Norms are invoked with greater frequency and intensity even as their capacity to settle disputes or forestall violence seems to weaken. What once promised order increasingly reads as performance.”The paradox is revealed in its starkest form when rulings of the UN security council or the international courts are invoked by western leaders who, in the next breath, prostrate themselves in front of Trump, caving in to his demands, calling him “daddy”,as Nato’s Mark Rutte did, and sending more lavish gifts to the Sun King and his family.Very few in 2025 stood up against what the Dutch historian Rutger Bregman called “immorality and unseriousness … the two defining traits of our leaders today”.Tom Fletcher, the head of the UN humanitarian agency Ocha, was arguably an exception. In May he asked UN diplomats “to reflect – for a moment – on what action we will tell future generations we each took to stop the 21st-century atrocity to which we bear daily witness in Gaza. It is a question we will hear, sometimes incredulous, sometimes furious – but always there – for the rest of our lives … Maybe some will recall that in a transactional world, we had other priorities. Or maybe we will use those empty words: We did all we could.”View image in fullscreenOman’s foreign minister, Badr bin Hamad Al Busaidi.Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/PAHis was a genuine howl of despair. Another cry of pain came from Oman’s foreign minister, Badr bin Hamad Al Busaidi. Speaking to the Muscat retreat of the Oslo Forum, an international mediators’ discussion group, he explained: “We are worryingly close to a world in which certain kinds of foreign intervention – if not outright invasion and annexation of territory – are accepted as a normal part of international relations, rather than as illegal violations of our shared international order. How did this happen?”Al Busaidi claims the problem predated Trump. “Restraint and respect for international law was abandoned in the aftermath of 9/11, with the launch of not one but two foreign interventions, in Iraq and Afghanistan, ostensibly aimed at the elimination of a terrorist threat, but in reality, functioning as explicit projects of regime change.”Now some on the left welcome the idea that international law’s entry into the limelight has coincided with its loss of credibility. The critics would share the view of the Marxist Perry Anderson, writing in New Left Review, that “on any realistic assessment, international law is neither truthfully international nor genuinely law”.They argue that US presidents – Democrat and Republican alike – have always in reality exempted themselves from the law’s constraints. The US has never been a signatory to the Rome statute or the UN convention on the law of the sea. Roosevelt was not that interested in forging a club of democracies, but wanted as much to create a law-based stability pact with Russia. Indeed, Prof John Dugard, a member of the South African legal team at the international court of justice, has argued that the Biden team’s choice of the phrase “rules-based order” was a revealing code because it showed the US ambiguity towards international law.The Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, has long declared that the US is promoting “a west-centric rules-based order as an alternative to international law”. China’s foreign minister, Wang Yi, made the same criticism in May 2021 during a UN security council debate on multilateralism. “International rules must be based on international law and must be written by all,” he said. “They are not a patent or privilege of a few. They must be applicable to all countries and there should be no room for exceptionalism or double standards.”For much of the global south too, the rules conceal histories of violence and racial hierarchy. Others see international law with its references to proportionality, distinction and necessity as a futile attempt to soften the essential brutality of war.It has been left to an older generation to insist there is something precious worth preserving. Take the response of Christoph Heusgen, the outgoing chair of the Munich Security Conference, in the wake of Vance’s speech attacking European valuesmade in February 2025.Heusgen, who served for 12 years as Angela Merkel’s adviser on security and foreign policy affairs, told the conference: “We have to fear that our common value base is not that common any more … It is clear that our rules-based international order is under pressure. It is my strong belief that this more multipolar world needs to be based on a single set of norms and principles, on the UN charter and the universal declaration of human rights.“This order is easy to disrupt. It’s easy to destroy, but it’s much harder to rebuild. So let us stick to these values.”But Ansari, despondent after a year of often fruitless Middle East diplomacy, predicts we are “moving from a world order to disorder”.“I don’t think we are moving towards a multipolar system. I don’t think we are even moving to a power-based international order. I don’t think we are moving towards any kind of system.“We are moving into a system where anybody can do whatever they like, regardless if they are big or small. As long as you have the ability to wreak havoc, you can do it because no one will hold you accountable.”This article was amended on 25 December 2025. An earlier version misreferred to John Kerry as a former US vice president; this should have said former US secretary of state."

Now they’re preparing to fight back.Liz Shuler, president of the AFL-CIO, said it was gearing up to challenge the US president’s “Billionaire First” agenda in 2026 – and drive candidates in key elections to stand up for “struggling” Americans.In an interview with the Guardian, she described how the federation has pushed to restore collective bargaining rights for federal workers, andfiledlawsuits against the Trump administration’s efforts to weaken unions and worker protections. “People were pissed,” said Shuler.The House of Representativespasseda bill on 11 December that would restore collective bargaining rights for federal workers in response to Trump’s executive orders that stripped the rights from more than 1 million federal government employees.“It was through a lot of good old-fashioned organizing,” said Shuler, who accused the president of overseeing “the biggest attack on unions in our history” by moving to eliminate collective bargaining for federal workers.The AFL-CIO is now steeling itself for a fight to pass the bill in the Senate in January, kicking off what it likely to be another hectic year. The threat of anothergovernment shutdownlooms at the end of January. The fight over extendingAffordable Care Act subsidiesis far from over.“We’re organizing as we speak,” said Shuler. “We can move actual people, in workplaces, in every city, in every state, across the country.”Affordability has come into sharp focus, withinflation still stubbornly above typical levels, and many Americans grappling with rising bills and prices. The federation intends to build momentum into the 2026 midterm elections on such kitchen table issues, according to Shuler, who said labor organizations were already reaching out to working people, canvassing and knocking on doors, in an effort to break through the noise.“People are fed up,” she said. “They’re saturated. I think they’re distrustful of institutions and the media. All of the folks that we have come to rely on over the years seem to be waning in trust, and there’s only one organization left that people do trust, and that’s the labor movement, unions. Our credibility and trust is actually going up. And so we think that we have to capitalize on what our sweet spot is, which is using our sphere of influence.”About 68% of Americans support labor unions,according to Gallup, despite a downward trend of union density in the US over the past several decades, which hascorrelated with the growth of income inequality.Trump promised to lower costs on day one and create good jobs, especially in manufacturing, noted Shuler. Those promises have not yet been fulfilled. Trump described apprehension over affordability as a “hoax”, and sought to downplay economic concerns such as thesputtering job market.“That’s not what people are experiencing,” Shuler said of Trump’s narrative. “They’re having to run up their credit-card debt. It’s atan all-time high, just to afford groceries. They’re looking at how they’re going to make their car payment, how they’re going to afford rent.“When I’m out on the road talking to people, housing and healthcare are two issues everybody is feeling. And that is not on the ‘Billionaire First’ agenda.”Trump is “rewarding the big corporations and the rich” while many Americans are “actually struggling”, she added. “I think that’s going to come into sharper focus as we go on into 2026. And that is what the labor movement is going to be very clear on. What are workers’ demands? Who is standing with us when it comes to candidates, and elected officials? And which side are you on?”Thousands of Starbucks baristas arecurrently on strike, as they campaign for the world’s largest coffee chain to grant them their first union contract.‘We’re not going anywhere’: how unionization ‘whirlwind’ set stage for historic Starbucks strikeRead more“This strike has really brought it in sharp focus, this divide that we’re seeing of an economy that’s working for the very rich, for the billionaires, the corporations and working people are piecing it together,” said Shuler. “They’re often working two or three jobs just to get by.“The future of this economy is absolutely in peril, if you think about how inequality is rampant, but also AI and advanced technology is going to continue to create this divide between the ultra rich and everyday people just trying to make a living.“It’s only going to get worse if we don’t get the guardrails in place, have more power for working people to negotiate what they need and bring some balance back into our economy.”The White House was contacted for comment.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

Although the Commanders (4-12) cut the gap to a touchdown on three different occasions, they couldn’t complete the comeback and absorbed their 10th loss in 11 games.Both teams were previously eliminated from playoff contention, which severely lessened the significance of this matchup between longtime NFC East rivals.Prescott completed 19 of 37 passes and helped Dallas convert all six of its fourth-down tries. His two TD passes gave him 30, tying Tony Romo’s franchise record of four seasons with at least 30 touchdown throws.Prescott shrugged off six sacks, including three by Jer’Zhan Newton.Playing without injured quarterbacks Jayden Daniels (elbow) and Marcus Mariota (quad, hand), Washington turned to 39-year-old journeyman Josh Johnson. Making his 10th career start and first since 2021, Johnson went 15 for 23 for 198 yards with no touchdowns or interceptions.Jacory Croskey-Merritt scored on runs of 10 and 72 yards for Washington. The latter touchdown got the Commanders to 24-17 in the third quarter, but Dallas restored its double-digit lead with a 52-yard field by Brandon Aubrey.Aubrey added a 51-yarder to make it 30-20 with 3:59 remaining.After Prescott threw a seven-yard touchdown pass to tight end Jake Ferguson on the game’s opening drive, Johnson went 3 for 3 for 68 yards to get Washington to 7-3. The key play was a 41-yard completion to Deebo Samuel, Johnson’s longest since 2018. Samuel finished by running into Donovan Wilson, knocking the safety’s helmet off.On their second possession, the Cowboys converted three fourth downs on a 17-play march that ended with a touchdown run by Javonte Williams. Prescott then made it three TDs in three drives with an 86-yard scoring pass to KaVontae Turpin.Detroit Lions 10-23 Minnesota VikingsThe Detroit Lions have gifted the division rival Green Bay Packers a spot in the playoffs.With six turnovers in a 23-10 loss to the Minnesota Vikings on Thursday, Detroit were eliminated from postseason contention – clinching at least a wild-card berth for Green Bay.After taking the past two NFC North titles, reaching the conference championship game after the first one and posting a franchise-record 15 wins for the second one, the Lions (8-8) lost their third straight game in a sloppy performance unfit for the NFL’s Christmas Day showcase.Jared Goff was charged with three lost fumbles, twice on errant snaps by backup center Kingsley Eguakun, and threw two interceptions after just six giveaways over the first 15 games this season. The Lions entered the week with only eight turnovers, the fewest in the league.Explore more on these topicsNFLDallas CowboysWashington CommandersUS sportsShareReuse this content"

Photograph: David Cannon/Getty ImagesIt felt like nothing would top Tiger Woods’s Masters win, but then the Northern Irishman completed his career grand slam on an extraordinary final day at AugustaByEwan MurrayThu 25 Dec 2025 03.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 25 Dec 2025 15.11 ESTShareAt 7am on 14 April in an Augusta rental home, Rory McIlroy awoke and immediately spotted a Green Jacket draped over a chair. “You think: ‘Yeah, that did happen yesterday,’” he says. “That.” McIlroy was now the sixth man towin all four of golf’s majors.The detail of what lay around in the bedroom of my own Augusta billet is of no interest to anybody. That was, however, a memorable morning. I had previously and wrongly believed nothing would topTiger Woods’s 2019 Masters winin respect of seismic reaction. Scores of messages from friends, colleagues, family members – umpteen of whom have no interest whatsoever in golf – had landed. Broadcast outlets across the world wanted my assessment of what had played out on Masters Sunday. Yeah, that did happen yesterday.‘A great night for golf’: McIlroy hails Spoty success after individual and team awardsRead moreThe first major I covered was McIlroy’s debut in the same format, at the 2007 Open Championship. My first trip to Augusta was four years later; I lost my luggage and stayed in a hotel that has long since and rightly been condemned. McIlroy tossed away what had looked an unassailable lead and the rest is storied, occasional brutal, history.Inserting yourself into a story we only tell for others never feels cool, but watching McIlroy so closely over almost two decades has been so thrilling, so compelling that it has been impossible not to root for him. Writing the words, “Rory McIlroy, Masters champion” was genuinely an emotional moment.It was also a fraught one. It may be reasonable to think somebody who has covered more majors than I care to remember has preordained sentiment about how to form a report. I did not and was delighted that was the case. Day four of the 89th Masters edition was extraordinary. The task was simple; write what you see.There was a brief period when I thought it would play out another way, when instead the latest hammer blow to McIlroy’s lifetime dream would be delivered. This was billed as a duel between McIlroy and Bryson DeChambeau, the Northern Irishman’s nemesis from the2024 US Open.View image in fullscreenRory McIlroy shows his anguish after making a bogey at the 18th in the final round of the 2024 US Open, letting in Bryson DeChambeau, who was up against him again at the Masters.Photograph: Jared C Tilton/Getty ImagesMcIlroy, the natural artist with sporting immortality on the line, versus the LIV man, the bludgeoner. Good versus bad is a stretch, but it sort of was.McIlroy made a double-bogey at the 1st hole on that Sunday. He missed an opportunity at the soft 2nd, as DeChambeau edged into the lead. “Not today,” said a fellow media member as I caught his eye on the walk towards the 3rd. I feared he was right. And if not today, perhaps not ever.It would, though, be wrong to depict the press as somehow wanting McIlroy to fail. There is dark humour and cynicism in this environment as routine. McIlroy is hugely popular among those who cover him. It also felt as if everyone had decided, including those Augusta galleries despite McIlroy supposedly being in opposition to an American, that he was due Masters glory. Supposedly is the operative term, because DeChambeau was to collapse.Rory McIlroy steps into league of his own with magical Masters triumph | Ewan MurrayRead moreBy the 10th green, McIlroy had the Masters won. Didn’t he? A birdie there took him to 14 under par. DeChambeau was now five back. Ludvig Åberg and Justin Rose lurked without anybody really sensing McIlroy’s Ryder Cup teammates could make a game of this. Rose had other ideas with a surge to 11 under (Åberg reached 10 and a three-way tie before collapsing) as McIlroy wobbled from the 11th onwards.Well, it had all felt a little too straightforward. McIlroy found a dodgy lie for his chip to the 13th green, which slid into water. Wondrous shots at the 15th – with a seven-iron he subsequently gave to the club – and 17th could not prevent a playoff.View image in fullscreenRory McIlroy watches as Justin Rose lines up a putt on the 18th hole, the 1st playoff hole. Rose missed from 15ft, and McIlroy holed from 4ft to win.Photograph: Mike Blake/ReutersHarry Diamond, McIlroy’s caddie and best friend, is no trained sports psychologist, but delivered the line of the week as the pair prepared for extra time. “Well, pal, you would have taken this position at the start of the week.”Journalistically, it was horrendously tricky. It was eithertheMcIlroy moment or an outright disaster. I could not exactly fudge words or hedge bets. On that Sunday in Augusta McIlroy was not only playing for the Masters, he was not only playing for completion of a career grand slam and he was not only seeking to end a wait for a fifth major stretching back to 2014. It was all of these things at once and, therefore, so significant.McIlroy’s reaction to victory is an easier reference point than the majestic approach he hit into the opening playoff hole. Pounding the grass, head in hands, tears in eyes. One of many incredible things about McIlroy is how relatable he has remained despite superstar status. You need not be a tour golfer to appreciate the magnitude of what was unfolding and the pain McIlroy had encountered on a path towards it.McIlroy may well win more Masters. He will certainly win more majors. Nothing will compare to this one.View image in fullscreenRory McIlroy was overcome with emotion after a long wait for a fifth major title.Photograph: Andrew Redington/Getty ImagesExplore more on these topicsRory McIlroyGolfThe MastersPGA TourEuropean TourUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

For sure there had been challenges en route to a 20th league title, but not many, and those that did arise were dealt with in a calm, orderly fashion. The ultimate prize had been captured with minimum sweat.Cue the celebrations after afinal‑day 1-1 draw with Crystal Palace: players and staff dancing on the pitch, supporters doing the same in the stands, and no sense this was as good as it was going to get for the just-crowned champions. It took less than 24 hours for everything to change and set in motion an astonishing seven‑month period in the history of a club where it was probably thought they had seen and done it all.Frank hits back at Slot over claim of ‘reckless’ Van de Ven challenge on IsakRead moreChaos, fear, tragedy, excitement, joy, despair, farce, fallout and setback after setback – it’s been there in one form or other for Liverpool since the Palace game, starting on the afternoon of Monday 26 May with a trophy parade that drew thousands of people to a 10-mile route through the city. Heavy rain lashed down but that was stopping nobody from rejoicing, including those at the top of an open-top bus where Van Dijk had the Premier League trophy in his hands for a second day in a row but this time with shades on and Calvin Harris at his side. It was a party all right and looked set to continue into the night, but then camethe incident for which the parade is remembered– a car ploughing into more than 130 people, with injured victims ranging from a six-month-old to a 77-year-old woman. The horrific moment led this month to the 54-year-old dad-of-threePaul Doyle receiving a jail sentence of more than 21 years.That has brought a level of closure for those affected but the sadness and pain will never fully recede, something that can also be said about thedeath of Diogo Jota in July. It is impossible to quantify the impact the sudden loss of a beloved figure has had on everyone associated with Liverpool, and especially those who knew him personally. Andy Robertson’s comments after Scotland sealed qualification for the World Cup with a4-2 victory over Denmark at Hampden Parkspoke volumes. “I’ve been in bits today,” the left‑back said. “I couldn’t get my mate Diogo Jota out of my head. We spoke so much about the World Cup. He missed out last time because of injury, I missed out because Scotland didn’t qualify, and we always discussed what it would be like.”Immense grief does not pass, certainly not quickly, and as Robertson’s words in November highlight it is still very much there for Liverpool’s players, affecting their minds and, consequently no doubt, their performances, which, to be frank, have been dreadful this season. Nine defeats came in 12 games, with a team renowned for sturdiness and control conceding 10 goals in the final three of those through a combination of individual and collective head‑loss. It was Liverpool’s worst run since 1953-54 and felt especially remarkable given a start to the campaign that had brought seven successive wins, albeit the signs were there then that not all was right.View image in fullscreenDiogo Jota lifts the Premier League at a jubilant Anfield on the final day of last season. It was the forward’s last appearance at the stadium before his sudden, tragic death.Photograph: Liverpool FC/Getty ImagesThis has been a collapse, pure and simple, and one no one saw coming when Liverpool broke the British transfer record tosign Alexander Isak from Newcastle for £125mon the final day of the window and take their summer spending to more than £440m on, among others,Florian Wirtz for £116mandHugo Ekitiké for £79m. The biggest outlay in the club’s history appeared to set them up for a run of further titles. Instead they have fallen at the first hurdle.Now Isak isout for a couple of months at least with a fractured legsustained in Saturday’s win at Tottenham, with Giovanni Leoni, another summer recruit, out for the season with atorn anterior cruciate ligament sustainedon his debut against Southampton in September. Mohamed Salah is unavailable owing to Africa Cup of Nations duty and may not play for the club again afterthatmixed‑zone interview at Leeds. And then there are all the other things that have taken place in recent weeks, such asEkitiké being sent off for taking his shirt off. Yes, that also happened.“Liverpool’s 2025-26 season has been chaotic,” says the freelance football writer and lifelong supporterAndrew Beasley. “Emotions have, understandably, veered all over the place and overall it’s been exhausting to watch. But despite the low points, the club should persist with Arne Slot. How many multiple league-winning managers are out there if they don’t? So much has been invested in the new-look Liverpool, Slot needs time to mould it.”That is reasonable, albeit Slot has hardly helped with some of his tactics, team selections and general handling of the squad. Equally, he has shown grace under fire and proved to be a compassionate and considerate figurehead in the aftermath of the parade and Jota’s death. For Slot as much as anyone this has been the most trying of times, stretching his remit of “head coach” to the limit, and as he moves through the festive period into the new year the one thing the Dutchman may desire more than anything is a return to the peace of old.In that regard it helps that Liverpool’s next game is at home against Wolves. Rob Edwards’ side will arrive at Anfield on Saturday with two points from 17 games and on course to be the worst‑performing side in Premier League history. This should be a straightforward win for the hosts. But, then again, nothing has been straightforward for them since that increasingly distant joyful spring day.Explore more on these topicsLiverpoolfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Robertson was a hugely important part of the great Forest team that under Brian Clough rose from the second tier of English football to win multiple major honours, most famously back-to-back European Cups.Robertson assisted the decisive goal in the first European Cup triumph in 1979 and scored the decisive goal in the second, contributions that mark him out as one of the most remarkable players in British football history. He earned 28 Scotland caps, notably scoring thewinning goal in a Home Championship victory over Englandat Wembley in May 1981. Clough described him as “the Picasso of our game”.Forest said in a statement: “We are heartbroken to announce the passing of Nottingham Forest legend and dear friend, John Robertson. A true great of our club and a double European Cup winner, John’s unrivalled talent, humility and unwavering devotion to Nottingham Forest will never ever be forgotten. Our thoughts are with John’s family, friends and all who loved him. Rest in peace, Robbo … Our greatest.”A statement from Robertson’s family said: “John passed away peacefully on Christmas morning with his wife and family by his side, after a long illness. Our only comfort in our grief is that his struggles are now over, and he is reunited with daughter Jessica. “Robbo” was treasured by many as a footballing hero but to us he was just John and dad, the family man … kind, loving, witty, fun and loyal. Although our hearts are breaking, we will always be grateful for the years we were privileged to share with him and the amazing memories.”Born in Uddingston, Lanarkshire in January 1953, Robertson played for Drumchapel Amateur FC before joining Forest in May 1970. A winger, he initially struggled to make an impact at the City Ground, mainly owing to a lack of professionalism characterised by a love of drinking, smoking and eating fried food. His career appear to be going nowhere until a showdown meeting with Clough’s assistant, Peter Taylor, in the summer of 1976. Taylor told Robertson in the starkest terms that unless he changed his ways he would be kicked out of the club immediately.View image in fullscreenJohn Robertson pictured in October 2015 outside the City Ground.Photograph: Fabio De Paola/The GuardianRobertson knuckled down and although he did not entirely clean up his off-pitch habits, he did so enough to allow his talent to shine. Two-footed, skilful, imaginative and hard-working, he became a fundamental part of the Forest team that went on an incredibly journey under an incredible manager.Under Clough, Forest won the First Division in 1978, a year after being promoted to the top tier. They also won the League Cup in 1978, a trophy they retained the following season when they secured the first of their European Cups, beating Malmö at the Olympic Stadium in Munich thanks to aTrevor Francis header from Robertson’s driving run and crossfrom the left wing.It was from the same flank that Robertson made the telling contribution in the following year’s final, drifting in before hitting alow, skidding shot from the edge of the areathat sealed Forest’s win over Hamburg at the Bernabéu.Peter Shilton, who also played in those European Cup finals for Forest, wrote on X: “I’m absolutely gutted to hear of the news of our NFFC miracle man Robbo the reunions will never be the same.”Robertson made more than 500 appearances for Forest, scoring 95 goals, another of his most telling being the penalty against Liverpool that sealed the 1978 League Cup in a replay. He joined Derby in 1983 before returning two years later to Forest, where he remained for a season before spells in non-league. Derby said in a statement that their “deepest condolences and thoughts are with John’s family and friends”.View image in fullscreenJohn Robertson played at two World Cup finals for Scotland.Photograph: Mark Leech/Offside/Getty ImagesAfter retiring as a player Robertson had a hugely successful period in coaching, including five years as assistant to his former Forest teammate Martin O’Neill at Celtic, during which the club won three league titles and reached the final of the Uefa Cup. Robertson also worked alongside O’Neill at Wycombe, Norwich, Leicester and Aston Villa.One of his players at Leicester, Stan Collymore, wrote on X that Robertson was “one of the loveliest, kindest-hearted humans I’ve met. At Leicester with Martin O’Neill he knew of my issues and problems and instead like many, who mocked them, he put a literal arm around me, had words of empathy and kindness and genuinely gave me support.”Robertson appeared at two World Cups, scoring in a 5-2 victory over New Zealand at the 1982 finals in Spain. He had made his World Cup debut against Iran four years earlier. The Scottish national team X account paid tribute to Robertson.Clough was not always nice about a player who, by his own admission, was not the most striking of athletes, describing him as “scruffy and unfit” and “a very unattractive young man”, but he was also in no doubt regarding Robertson’s importance to his team. Asked on 27 May 1980, a day before the European Cup final, how Forest would deal with Hamburg’s Manny Kaltz, then considered one of the best right-backs in the world, Clough replied: “We have got a little fat guy who will turn him inside out.” He was proven right.Explore more on these topicsNottingham ForestScotlandnewsShareReuse this content"

The Premier League auction is expected to take place later the same year.The EFL’sdeal with Sky Sportsis worth £935m over five years, giving the broadcaster exclusive live rights to 1,059 games each season from the Championship, League One, League Two, the Carabao Cup and EFL Trophy. The EFL could make all 1,891 of its matches available if it reaches an agreement with the Premier League and Football Association over removing the blackout.The Premier League is also keen to explore selling every game given the declining value of media rights across Europe. Although its domestic deal with Sky Sports and TNT Sports is worth a record £6.7bn over four years, the league added an extra year to the contract and increased the number of games from 215 to 270 each season, so the real-terms value has declined by 23% from the previous cycle between 2022 and 2025.View image in fullscreenThe Premier League domestic deal with Sky Sports and TNT Sports is worth a record £6.7bn over four years.Photograph: Allstar Picture Library Ltd/Richard Sellers/Apl/SportsphotoMany of the Premier League clubs’ American owners have been pushing to broadcast every game for some time, as happens in every sport in the US. The blackout relates to Article 48 of Uefa’s statutes, under which the transmission of live football in a territory can be prohibited for “two and a half hours on a Saturday or a Sunday”. It applies in an English leagues context when 50% of Premier League and Championship matches are scheduled for Saturday at 3pm, a proviso that enabled the EFL to televise all its games on the opening weekend this season because the Premier League did not begin until the following week.The FA, which is responsible for applying to Uefa to impose Article 48 if asked to do so by the leagues, is unlikely to object to the blackout being dropped. Last season there were discussions at the FA about the Women’s Super League being exempted from the blackout, which is in place between 2.45pm and 5.15pm on Saturday, but the Premier League and EFL raised concerns on legal grounds.Article 48 is enforced in Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales so if it is lifted the Premier League and EFL may face demands for compensation from the leagues there. In the event of Article 48 no longer applying in England, 3pm Premier League kick-offs would be broadcast across the UK, which could have a negative effect on attendances.Explore more on these topicsFootballFootball politicsShareReuse this content"

That is my feeling. So you [Mainoo] just need to wait for each chance and everything can change in football in two days. He will have the opportunity that he has all the time to force his way in.”Amorim challenges Manchester United to ‘step up’ after Bruno Fernandes injuryRead moreAmorim pointed to Mainoo’s ability to play a variety of roles. “The position of Casemiro [No 6], he can do it. He can play if we play with three in midfield. He can play like we play in the position of Mason Mount [No 10].”Amorim said this month he wasopen to a loanfor Mainoo, who the United hierarchydo not want to sell, but has now indicated a move would be possible only if a replacement were signed. “If we are not getting someone, it is hard to leave,” he said.With the United captain, Bruno Fernandes, out for a prolonged period with an injury and Bryan Mbeumo and Amad Diallo – two possible No 10s – at the Africa Cup of Nations, Mainoo may get more game time when fit.Amorim has previously suggested he may change from his 3-4-3 system. The Portuguese expanded on why, saying: “We can play a different way to take more quality from these players because I have the feeling that if we have to play a perfect 3-4-3 we need to spend a lot of money and we need time. I’m starting to understand that is not going to happen so maybe I have to adapt.”Casemiro and Harry Maguire are each in the final year of their contracts and Amorim was asked whether a decision has been made on either player. The Brazilian’s deal has a one-year option but his weekly salary of around £365,000 makes him United’s highest earner and means it is unlikely an extension will be triggered.“We need to understand what is going to happen in the next season – if there will be the European games,” Amorim said. “At this moment, we are not thinking about that. I’m really happy with them.”Amorim was glowing in his praise of Casemiro’s work ethos. “If everyone trains like him, if everyone is so focused on the detail, even in training, in set pieces training, even when they are playing 10-versus-goalkeeper, and the movements that he made imagining the game, we will be a top team.”Explore more on these topicsManchester UnitedRuben AmorimnewsShareReuse this content"

It’s not that I believe facilities are the be-all and end-all but they are a great way of setting standards higher and showing your ambition in a clear and strong way.”If Howe struggled to hide his frustration about the lack of final decisions on training ground and stadium projects that could respectively take five and 10 years to complete, he also recognised the need for thoroughness.“The decisions have to be right,” he said. “If extra time is needed to make the right decisions, then take it. You need the right site and designs. I would rather it was correct than rushed.View image in fullscreenNewcastle’s ownership remains undecided on whether to redevelop St James’ Park or opt for a new-build.Photograph: Andy Buchanan/AFP/Getty Images“I know there’s a 99.9% chance that I’m not going to see either completed in my [present] position but I’m still passionate about making sure they’re there for future generations of Newcastle supporters and players.”Regardless of how long he remains in charge, Howe has left a legacy after choreographing last spring’s Carabao Cup triumph. “The last 12 months have been unbelievable for us because we finally won a trophy, and when I came here that was the big aim,” he said. “And it’s a great experience to be in the Champions League again.”Howe admitted, though, that he sometimes struggles for instant job satisfaction. “The word ‘enjoy’ is one I battle with, because, when I go home every day, very rarely will I go: ‘I really enjoyed that,’” he said. “It’s a difficult one because I love coaching. I love being on the grass with the players.“But there’s a lot of the job that sort of gets in the way of that. So while I must ultimately love it and enjoy it, that’s on a more probably subconscious level. A lot of the day-to-day emotions are stress and anxiety.”Nonetheless, Howe agreed 2025 has been the best year of his managerial career. “It has to be. And I have to remind myself of that sometimes. When you feel a bit battered and bruised as you do as a football manager at times, you sometimes have to take a step back and see things for what they are and not what people tell you they are.“It’s been a great year, 2025, and one that in the future I will look back on and really appreciate even more than I do right now. But the challenge never stops and you want to make 2026 even better and that is the tricky part. “Explore more on these topicsNewcastle UnitednewsShareReuse this content"

Rather, it is part of the reason why Rice is being discussed as one of the best players in the world.“You can’t eff and blind, you can’t bully people,” says Terry Westley, the head of West Ham’s academy when Rice was there. “But we should be able to have a conversation and say: ‘Look, that ain’t quite good enough and we want to help you because this is what we need to do.’Declan Rice cranks up volume to show he is Europe’s best player right now | Nick AmesRead more“Either they walk out your office and go: ‘Fucking bloke, don’t know what he’s talking about. I’m going to tell my dad or my agent.’ Or you walk out the office and go: ‘Right, what do I need to do? Let’s get on with the work.’”It is fairly clear which camp Rice fell into. One Champions League-winning coach recently privately described him as “the best midfielder in the world”, which even when he wasa £105m signing for Arsenaltwo years ago seemed a stretch. To longtime observers, his rise has occurred gradually and then all at once, encapsulated in an astonishingperformance against Real Madridin April when he scored two brilliant goals from free-kicks in a 3-0 win.View image in fullscreenDeclan Rice training at West Ham in August 2018.Photograph: Arfa Griffiths/WHUFC/Getty ImagesIf you consider his backstory of rejection and the need to give that clean feedback, it is barely credible Rice should be discussed in the terms he is today. Chelsea ditched him at 14, which is beginning to bear comparison with Decca Records rejecting the Beatles. But even as a 16-year-old at West Ham coaches were divided over whether to offer Rice a scholarship, the pathway to the first team.By his own admission, Rice had an odd, uncoordinated running style, which is further evidence of his extraordinary development. A Premier League manager describes him as being “like a Rolls-Royce, so graceful in his actions and movements”.Westley recalls the debate over the gangly teenager and whether he would make the cut. “There were people who weren’t as forthright as I was,” he says about the decision over offering a scholarship. “There was no guaranteed pro contract for Declan, but there was no moaning from him. The scholarship came after a game at Fulham when I put him in the under-18 team. I said: ‘You don’t need to be panicking any more. We’re going to give you the scholarship.’“Declan gave a talk for me last year [to young footballers] and he said: ‘I look back now and I think having had clean feedback [back then], I can’t now accept anything else.’ I told him: ‘That’s really powerful.’“He said that we didn’t pussyfoot around. [But] you can’t give many people clean feedback any more. [You’re] tiptoeing around. Agents don’t tell their players clean feedback because they’re scared of losing them. Very rarely do I come across a parent who’s going to tell them the truth. They don’t want to hear it either.”View image in fullscreenDeclan Rice signs a new contract at West Ham with Terry Westley (left) and the manager Slaven Bilic in 2017.Photograph: Arfa Griffiths/WHUFC/Getty ImagesNeither Westley, nor Tony Carr, who rescued Rice from Chelsea at 14 on the recommendation of his scout Dave Hunt, could have predicted this ugly duckling would blossom into quite as elegant a swan.Carr says: “Dave said: ‘We should take a look at this kid Chelsea have released. I think he’s got a bit more to him,’” a line, 12 years on, that reads like one of the more understated and prescient judgments in recent football history.Slaven Bilic, who gave Rice his West Ham debut, is characteristically blunt. “We thought he might one day turn out to be West Ham captain as a centre-back, a John Terry type, because he was reliable and had determination. But let’s not bullshit. Did he look like he would go on to be one of the best midfielders in the Premier League? No, I can’t lie.”Carr brought Rice into West Ham, initially on trial, which meant the teenager had to leave his family home in Kingston, south-west London. He moved into West Ham’s version of Hogwarts, two big Georgian houses joined together in Chadwell Heath, near the old training ground, where academy players live together.His willingness to embrace the change was notable. “He was very bright, very confident,” Carr says. “Although he was probably nervous, he wanted the ball all the time. He listened and he was a very quick learner.”View image in fullscreenDeclan Rice’s set-piece ability has drawn praise from his England teammate, Jordan Pickford.Photograph: Alex Pantling/FA/Getty ImagesThe quick-learning component to Rice has been evident in embracing his set- piece role, which puts him at the heart of the latest tactical trend in football and makes him even more important forArsenaland England.“He has got one of the most powerful whips I have ever seen,” said his England teammate Jordan Pickford. As Rice has said, it is a skill he may have overlooked were it not for Mikel Arteta andArsenal’s set-piece coach, Nicolas Jover, encouraging him to embrace it during a midwinter trip to Dubai in 2024.Then there is the switch from the cautious, defensive No 6 to the marauding No 8. The criticism midfield greats such as Graeme Souness and Roy Keane made about him at the time of his £105m move – that he didn’t score enough goals – is said to have registered with him.Just as when Chelsea rejected him, confidants say he did not brood on it, but looked for ways to improve that part of his game.View image in fullscreenDeclan Rice has progressed from rejection by Chelsea to being a vital part of Thomas Tuchel’s World Cup hopes with England.Photograph: Alex Pantling/FA/Getty Images“I’ve done some work on champions in different sports and [the common thread is] that when you give someone information, they’re hungry for it, they’re thirsty for more,” says Westley. “They thrive on wanting to do something different; they don’t sneer. He falls in that bracket. ‘What can I learn now? What do I need to do? How can I do that?’ He was like that when he left Chelsea and joined us.”‘His impact is huge’: Arteta hails Rice’s attacking evolution before Chelsea testRead moreIt has been intriguing to see Rice, who will be 27 on 14 January, embrace his superstar status this season. Arteta calls him a “lighthouse” on the pitch, apt not just because of his height but also because of his ability to lead throughrocky moments of the season.Off the pitch, he has attended London’s Fashion Awards and doubtless had fresh bouts of clean feedback from teammates when discussing his favourite moisturisers, fragrance and the eye patches he uses as part of his grooming regime. Observers say that even while he was at West Ham there was a hint of Bobby Moore about him.“He was always slick, looking sharp,” says one West Ham staffer. The Nanushka leather jacket and Savile Row-styled trousers he wore in a recent photoshoot were very much in the vein of England’s World Cup-winning captain.View image in fullscreenDeclan Rice at the Fashion Awards at the Royal Albert Hall in December 2025.Photograph: WWD/Getty ImagesEmulating Moore’s 1966 heroics is the task Rice will embark on next year, as well as getting Arsenal over the line in the Premier League and going beyond last year’s Champions League semi-final.“He will certainly be central to all of those teams and performances, so then would be a Ballon d’Or contender. I’m seeing he’s been mentioned in that class in the media,” says Westley, who is old and wise enough to add: “That’s a lot of ifs. A lot needs to drop to the right side for him to win that.”A Premier League manager backs that assessment. “He would certainly be in a group of the best in the world at the moment, but to be named the best he would have to be winning things for Arsenal.”The only component missing from Rice’s status is major trophies. Doubtless some clean feedback on that gap in his CV will help focus the mind for 2026.Explore more on these topicsArsenalWest Ham UnitedfeaturesShareReuse this content"

They can put boats out. I think there will be some retirements in these conditions.”The crew aboard Master Lock Comanche, a leading contender for line honours, has been encouraged to look after themselves.“If you’re not on watch and you’ve got an opportunity to get a break, over two days [on the water] is a long time,” Comanche co-skipper James Mayo said.“It’s very important that you get rest because the race starts again once you get towards the Derwent.”Conditions are expected to become lighter on Sunday as the fleet’s 100ft supermaxis approach the finish line at Constitution Dock.Comanche, LawConnect and SHK Scallywag 100 are rated the leading contenders for line honours.View image in fullscreenSkipper of LawConnect Christian Beck speaks to media prior to the start of the 2025 Sydney to Hobart.Photograph: Jeremy Ng/Getty ImagesLawConnect is heavier than Comanche, enjoys rough conditions and boasts an impressive crew, all of which should play into her hand.But owner Christian Beck again downplayed his boat’s chances of athird consecutive line honours triumph.“It’s a bit like [F1 driver] Max Verstappen likes it when it’s raining, we like it when it’s very rough,” he said.“This forecast is a little bit rough but it’s probably not rough enough to make it that likely that we’ll win, unfortunately.”The CYCA has been heartened by the fleet’s eagerness to take part in a tribute to victims of the Bondi terror attack since first announcing plans on Christmas Eve.At the final briefing, extra rose petals were made available for crews to take on board.“I asked 15 boats, CYC member boats, to make a tribute, to scatter rose petals as they go past Bondi Beach at sea,” Haynes said.“But after those 15 boats, a lot of other boats have followed, in fact I believe the whole fleet.”Explore more on these topicsSydney to Hobart yacht raceSailingAustralia sportnewsShareReuse this content"

Those teams don’t reach semi-finals, don’t reach finals.“We’ve got this opportunity now, at home, in front of our families [against Quins]. We talked about families watching, your kids watching. Does it matter? Does it [defeat] hurt enough? Real deep questions around that. We’ve delved into that.”Both sides will have a point to prove at CorpAcq Stadium on Friday: “dented pride” as Sanderson put it.Harlequins were thrashed by Bristolat Twickenham last Saturday, conceding 40 points, while Sale leaked 47 against rampant Saints on the same day.Sanderson said the pre-Christmas meeting with the owners, Simon and Michelle Orange, established minimum requirements for the squad given the level of investment: Sale’s most recent accounts showed an annual loss of £8m.“The owners came in to say: ‘This isn’t going to stop.’ They’re supporting the players financially and will continue to do that … The understanding is that if they’re financially supporting the club, the minimum they ask for is a performance based around effort. Everyone can try hard, can’t they?“They came in to show solidarity and to tell the players that nothing’s going away in terms of support. It wasn’t an ultimatum but just: ‘Understand we’re all in this together.’ I thought that was quite a powerful thing.”Sanderson welcomes the England fly-half George Ford back to face Harlequins after a groin strain with Bevan Rodd, Joe Carpenter and Rekeiti Ma’asi-White also returning to action.“There’s a few big hitters that could come into the frame,” Sanderson said. “They are going to be a massive boost for us, not just in terms of experience, but how they drive standards which weren’t there last weekend. We need a response.”Explore more on these topicsSalePrem RugbyRugby unionnewsShareReuse this content"

Tyrannyis boomingover here.You may have read in your colourful newspapers that my country’s president would like to shut me up – because I don’t adore him in the way he likes to be adored. The American government made a threat against me and the company I work for, and all of a suddenwe were off the air. But then, you know what happened? A Christmas miracle happened.

We won, the president lost – and now I’m back on the air every night, givin’ the most powerful politician on Earth a right, and richly deserved, bollocking. That’s a word, right – I used it properly?And the reason I’m telling you this story is because maybe you’re thinking: “Oh a government silencing its critics is something that happens in places like Russia, or North Korea, or LA, not the UK.” Well, that’s what we thought, and now we’ve got King Donny the Eighthcalling for executions.

I mean I don’t know if you know this, buthis son lives here. We just – well some of us – have a problem with the guy who thinks he is our king.Here in the United States right now, we are both figuratively and literally tearing down the structures of our democracy.

It sounds dumb, but it worked (a little bit)Read more summer essentialsThu 25 Dec 2025 16.41 ESTLast modified on Thu 25 Dec 2025 17.02 ESTShareIam someone who believes it is never too late to change. I think you can in fact teach an old dog new tricks, as long as the old dog is open-minded and willing to learn. As long as the old dog is willing to admit when it was wrong, and work to become a better dog.OK yes, I am the old dog. And the trick I am trying to learn, even though I am decrepit? It is an important one, something I have struggled with, frequently, for my entire life. I have been trying … to become less scared of huntsman spiders. Apologies to all the other spiders that exist; I have to be realistic about my possible growth as a human. It also has to be the huntsman because it is large, in charge, and the one I encounter most often. Including three times in the last week. Inside my home. You can’t see me but I’m shaking my head and grimacing as I type.I knew one day I’d have to watch powerful men burn the world down – I just didn’t expect them to be such losers | Rebecca ShawRead moreI doubt I’ll ever reach “fan” status, but I’ve been working on at least becoming Normal about them.I have been terrified of spiders since I was a child (unlike other children who adore them). Growing up, I had ample brothers around to make sure I never had to engage with any personally, but I still freaked out if one was visibly in the same room as me. I have a strong memory of one morning when I was eight, my family still asleep, and trying to deal with a spider that had crawled on to the lounge-room wall. I “dealt” with it by standing incredibly far away, almost into the next room (in case it ran after me), and spraying half a bottle of insect spray toward it. It didn’t reach the spider, but it did reach and annoy everyone in my house.As I got older, whoever I was dating or living with was, by default, the least afraid of spiders between us, and therefore in charge of dealing with it, while I made low keening sounds and ran away. If I was on my own, my tactic was simply to leave the room, turn off the light and try to forget about its existence before I had to enter again.Recently, I stayed at a friend’s house where there was a very large huntsman who lived in the window frame, mostly just hanging out. In order to be less scared of it, I imagined the spider as a her, a girlie, one of us, just chilling in the sun and listening to us yap. It sounds extremely dumb, but it worked (a little bit). Or, actively deciding to become less scared worked.Whatever the case, I’ve tried to keep it up. I think about all the logical reasons not to be scared. I know huntsman spiders won’t harm me. I know they eat things like flies and mosquitoes (my mortal enemies). I know they are one of nature’s beautiful, harmless-to-humans creatures.In Australia: giant spider carrying a mouse is horrifying and impressiveRead moreUnfortunately, however, they do continue to walk likethat.They move in the most terrifying and borderline immoral way imaginable. The sight of their many legs carrying them at that terrible speed causes my caveman brain to kick into overdrive. They claim to only have eight legs, but I believe that triples when they move.But it isn’t their fault that they have scary legs, and they have just as much right to be where I am – if not more. I’ve found that taking the steps of trying not to immediately exit my own skin and run away when I see one, trying to remain still and breathing, and deliberately thinking about their positive qualities, has actually started to help.Just because they are hairy creatures that scuttle about extremely quickly in a way that haunts my sleep, doesn’t mean they deserve my hatred, or my girly screams. I can admit when I’ve been wrong and driven by unfounded fear. I’m not sure I’ll ever make it to the “catching one in a Tupperware container and taking it outside” stage, but you never know. There’s a few years left in this old dog yet.Rebecca Shaw is a Guardian Australia columnistExplore more on these topicsSpidersOpinionWildlifecommentShareReuse this content"

It’s a source of delight in a difficult summerKate LyonsWatching the Ashes has felt like a small bright spot. Something for Australians to cheer about when our hearts are brokenThu 25 Dec 2025 14.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 25 Dec 2025 16.35 ESTShareOne of the many joys of this Ashes series is that this summer my daughter has begun to care about cricket.And there is nothing that reminds you of the beautiful weirdness of the game so much as trying to explain it to a relentlessly curious five-year-old.First there’s the language of cricket, which frankly bears no resemblance to language we use in the rest of our lives. We’ve resorted to calling “overs” “turns”, “runs” “points” and “bowling” “throws” to help her understand what we’re talking about.There are the obvious explanatory challenges presented by the rules – watching my husband try to explain lbw (leg before wicket) was a sight to behold – and then there’s just the variability of the game.Pitch perfect: why listening to cricket on radio soothes a world that won’t hear senseRead more“How long does it go for?” she asks. “Five days, but it could be four, or three,” we tell her.Or – as was the case for the first men’s Ashes Test this year, when we promised her it would still be on the next day when she woke up, and then Travis Head obliterated England’s bowling attack – two.“But who is winning?” she has asked more times than I can count over the past month. “Well, it doesn’t really work like that,” we say.What sort of sport is this?Cricket is also a drama of personalities and her observations of the human element of the game have demonstrated a child’s delightful clear-eyed perceptiveness.View image in fullscreen‘My favourite of her reactions was when Ben Stokes was hit in the groin by a scorching delivery.’Photograph: Dave Hunt/AAP“Why is he so grumpy?” she asked when the camera kept cutting – with a regularity that bordered on cruelty – to Nathan Lyon as 12th man during the Test at the Gabba.Then, when his return to the side in the third Test was cut short by that furious dive in the outfield, she was alert to my strong reaction. “What did he do wrong? What’s a ‘numpty’? Why is he too old to do things like that? How old is he?”My favourite of her reactions was when Ben Stokes was hit in the groin by a scorching delivery from Michael Neser. She was perplexed by the response, both from her parents and the commentators who couldn’t stop laughing. “Why do they keep showing it and laughing if it hurts him?” Bless her.Also, alert to injustice in the way that children often are, she observed one day: “There are no women talking.”We jumped in to tell her there is the excellent Alison Mitchell but she’s right. Like Paw Patrol with its six heroic dog characters, only one of whom is female – also a source of outrage in her life – this is not an acceptable gender mix.I am under no illusions that a key part of the appeal for her is that cricket is television, hours and hours of television that is permitted by her parents, who normally keep screen time reasonably rationed.Television on while we’re at the dinner table? Never. During the evening session of the pink ball Test? Absolutely.She can’t believe her luck.The weirdness of cricket, which I am seeing afresh this season through her eyes, has made me deeply grateful to my parents (and brother and grandad) for indoctrinating me into the sport as a child. I don’t profess to be a cricket expert – as I’m sure this article will attest – but I know enough to enjoy it.I have decided to embrace my family’s traditions and go to a cricket match | Coco KhanRead moreIt’s a sport with a high bar of entry. I’m sure you can pick up “enjoying cricket” as an adult but, as with learning how to swim, or speak Mandarin, it’s much easier as a kid.Maybe it is because of this that I have loved watching my daughter’s nascent love of the game – the moment she squealed with delight when she watched a batsman hit a cracking four and yelled to us “He did something good! The referee [sic] went like this!” and waved her arm horizontally in front of her.I love, too, the way that cricket can be a salve in an otherwise hard time. This summer, already scarred by violence and tragedy just a few weeks in, cricket has felt for me, I think probably for many, like a small bright spot.A flicker of normality in the dark fortnight we have all just lived through. A – respectfully – ultimately unimportant contest that has allowed us to have something to cheer about or just quietly follow, at a time our hearts are broken.I wonder if this has been part of the appeal for her, too, perceptive as she is.This summer hasn’t had an easy start for my little family. Apart from the cataclysm of theBondi attack, which would be more than enough in itself, we have been dealing with the death of someone very close to us.Cricket hasn’t fixed anything, or balanced the scales in any way. I don’t want to overstate things. But it has given us something to cheer for, something to distract and delight us and – given we are not England supporters – something to care about that doesn’t break our hearts.Explore more on these topicsCricketOpinionAustralia cricket teamParents and parentingChildrenAshes 2025-26Australia sportEngland cricket teamcommentShareReuse this content"

On the ground floor, there’s a corner for foreign literature and another for French literature, with the latest releases right at the front. For nonfiction and essays, you used to have to go downstairs. But two years ago, they put a new table in front of the French literature corner for feminist essays and memoirs. A prime spot for people to grab a piece of the revolution without thinking about it too much. This change took a wild turn when local geniusAnnie Ernauxwon the Nobel prize in 2022. Where should we put her work: in the crowded space for new French literature or the feminist memoir table?This dilemma is now a regular question in France. The Anglosphere and other European countries have been wrestling with it over the past two decades, but here the line between fiction and nonfiction has only just begun to vanish in the minds of authors and their editors. Should we put a new table between the two? It would be a perfect spot for great autofiction such as Édouard Louis’s or Christine Angot’s novels. Or deeply personal nonfiction such as Alice Coffin’s Le Génie Lesbien or Adèle Yon’s bestseller Mon vrai nom est Élisabeth – her first novel and a literary quest to reveal the patriarchal violence suffered by the author’s great-grandmother. More than 150,000 copies have been sold since its release in February.Much of the new work released this year falls in such a literary no man’s land. In 2025,484 new novelshit the market in France. Many of the authors chose to shine a light on their matriarchal figure. Amélie Nothomb – one of the most prolific and creative novelists in the country – wrote about her mother in Tant mieux. Emmanuel Carrère, best known for his disturbing and eccentric novel The Moustache, did the same in Kolkhoze. Raphaël Enthoven (generally more prolific on foreign politics than literature) wrote about his mother and her sickness in L’Albatros. Matthieu Niango’s Le Fardeau explores the peculiar story of his mother, born in a Nazi maternity ward. Others chose to focus on an absent paternal figure: Anne Berest in Finistère takes the opportunity of his father approaching his last breath to truly get to know him; in Jacky, Anthony Passeron knits a patchwork of the few memories his father created in his childhood before vanishing into thin air.This convergence of so many authors into a similar theme was the main angle of media coverage during the autumn literary season. “The literary season firmly focused on the family” (Radio France), “Literary season 2025: 9 books on family roots” (Vogue), “Our Selection of 7 Powerful Novels About Family Roots, Secrets, and Legacies” (Pélerin), “A literary season that puts light on the ancestors” (Nouvel Obs). It came as no surprise that when the literary prizes began to be awarded, the elite of theGermanopratinacknowledged the effort of authors to expose their roots so sincerely.On 4 November, the prestigiousGoncourt prizewent to La Maison vide, in which Laurent Mauvignier explores the drawers and cupboards of his rural family home to tell his family story through the lives of his grandmother, great-grandmother and great-great-grandmother. “Notably, the four finalist novels draw on autobiographical sources. We are therefore far from the ‘work of prose imagination’ that the Goncourt prize claims to distinguish,”wroteElisabeth Philippe, critic for the weekly magazine Le Nouvel Obs. “But who will complain, since this criterion is no longer particularly relevant in an era when genres are happily hybridising?”From 1903, the Goncourt prize persisted through a great metamorphosis in french literature: in 1919 Marcel Proust won for In Search of Lost Time, his novel of seven volumes flirting with autobiography. In 1977, the author Serge Doubrovskyinvented a wordfor this new way of writing another self: “autofiction”. Since then, in the creative writing classes offered at dozens of universities, students are increasingly taught this approach to write about untold stories from their perspectives – more than they are taught to write fiction from scratch (even if the “scratch” is always personal) or copy US or English personal essay writers, such as Roxane Gay, Rebecca Solnit or Deborah Levy.Anne Pauly is one of them. In 2020, she published her first novel, Avant que j’oublie, inspired by the death of her own father. Like many others, she was amazed to see so many books focusing on parents and family this year. But not completely surprised. “When I wrote my book, the father figure was a big subject. We were justifying our fathers’ conduct or ways of being or not being present. Through my novel, I was looking to go past the faded colours of the ‘ideal father’. After #MeToo and the Pelicot rape trial, it is now time to go past the invisibility of our mothers and grandmothers.”She said she saw in this collective retreat from classic fiction a real panic and desire to put the record straight. “The last people who witnessed Nazi barbarism are dying and we are entering an Orwellian post-truth era, not to mention that a robot knows better than us what to cook for supper. More than ever, we have an urge to hold tight to a disappearing world.” In the Anglosphere, “autofiction” and the turn to memoir was often dismissed as self-involved navel gazing. But inFranceit has hit its stride at a much different time. Perhaps traditional fiction is being put aside for a while in favour of plainly confronting the world. These authors invite us to start a real dialogue within ourselves and open our drawers: because how can we write and read good stories without knowing our own history?Anne-Laure Pineau is an independent writer based in Le Havre, FranceExplore more on these topicsBooksOpinionFranceFictionAnnie ErnauxEuropecommentShareReuse this content"

Politicians, voters and journalists have made this claim before – when their side has been out of power for a long while, or when an elected government has been unusually dictatorial – and their warnings have usually been overstated. But this time the evidence of a fundamental shift away from a century-old status quo seems stronger.Familiar landmarks have disappeared:Labourand Tory dominance, two-party electoral contests, the decisive power of a big Westminster majority, the patience voters usually show towards a new government, the predictable pendulum swing between right and left, the red lines between mainstream and extreme politics and even the central role of parliament.Our possible next rulers,Reform UK, barely bother with the Commons, ignoring the convention that that is where future prime ministers make their names. The current government, despite a bland, diligent leader and some decent policies, is despised by most voters with an intensity that may be unprecedented. In the online spaces where political opinions are increasingly formed, debatable facts, rumours, myths, outright fictions and raw emotions surge back and forth, erupt into geysers of outrage – and then subside into stagnant pools of disillusionment.“Confidence in the system of governing Britain remains at a historic low,” the National Centre for Social Researchreported in June. “Trust in governments and MPs … [is] lower now than … after any previous election.” In the New Statesman, in October, the veteran commentator Andrew Marrexpresseda common establishment view: “Britain has become ungovernable.”Because the old party structures and Westminster’s web of institutions and rituals remain, drawing attention to themselves and still shaping the political calendar, it remains possible, some of the time, to believe that British politics is not really changing. There are also many people with a vested interest in prolonging the old order, from MPs who want to enjoy traditional, extended parliamentary careers, to journalists with mainly Tory and Labour contacts. And then there is the unease many voters may feel, whether they like the status quo or not, about Britain adopting a new, yet to be defined, political culture, in a world increasingly full of hostile states and authoritarians. Contempt for the Labour-Tory duopoly could turn to nostalgia ifNigel Faragewelcomes Vladimir Putin to Downing Street.Yet until Reform UK – or perhaps an equally untried coalition of anti-Reform parties – is tested and constrained by holding office, then Britain’s new politics remains free to develop in many parallel, largely uninhibited ways. What might these political futures be?Some relatively optimistic centrists and leftists atthe journal Renewaland the pressure group Compass see the need for ananti-Reform popular frontalso as an opportunity: to finally begin Britain’s shift to a European-style politics of coalition and proportional representation. Strikingly this year, despite all the government’s troubles and Reform UK’s poll breakthroughs, the combined support for Labour, the Lib Dems and the Greens hasn’t fallen much: from 48% in January to 44% now, according to the websitePolitico’s latest poll of polls. Meanwhile, support for the left-leaning SNP and Plaid Cymru has held steady. The widespread idea that Britain has recently become a much more reactionary country is more of a rightwing hope, and leftwing fear, than a description of reality.But the problem for those who see potential in the poll trends for a long-term progressive majority at Westminster is that this year another, almost equally large bloc has beenforming: on the right. The combined Tory-Reform UK vote was 46% at the start of January and is 48% now. WithTory defectionsto Reform continuing, the parties’ approaches to immigration and many other issues blurring, and the denials that they will form an alliance sounding steadily less definitive, the prospect is growing of a confrontation – perhaps lasting years – between two multi-party blocswith deeply opposed values. The Brexit wars may come to seem modest by comparison.Our electoral system’s unsuitability for this kind of fragmented and polarised politics adds another new layer of uncertainty. The next general election could see four, or even five – if Reform’s recent dip in the polls continues – parties get a similar number of votes, yet win wildly diverging numbers of seats. A distortion of democracy on this scale has never happened in Britain before. How the winners and losers from such a lottery would react, and how the random quality of the results would affect the legitimacy of whatever government emerges, whether in the eyes of voters, financial markets or foreign states, are questions that Westminster is generally avoiding.The election may not be for another three-and-a-half years: a long time in today’s accelerated politics. During this period of waiting some of Britain’s old political habits could reassert themselves. Some voters may return to the traditional main parties, especially if Farage’serratic responseto the allegations about his schooldays proves to be a sign of fragility under pressure.This year, the two once-dominant parties have returned to some old themes. Labour policies such as unapologeticallyraising taxes on the richhave begun to echo postwar social democracy, while the Tories have returned to their own familiar territory ofmoralising about benefits claimantsand promising austerity. If Kemi Badenoch continues to improve as Tory leader, and if Labour can somehow refresh its own leadership, then it’s possible that 2025 will be remembered as the end of an era of intense political instability, rather than its beginning.Yet an even more turbulent late 2020s feels more likely. Voters have so many reasons to stay angry, from depressed earnings to the elevated cost of living. Online politics has been designed by tech companies never to calm down. Meanwhile, in France, the continuedrise of rightwing populism, despite successive electoral coalitions constructed to keep it out of office, suggests that such tactics only work for so long.If Reform UK does win power, itsbullying but ineptrecord in local government suggests that it, in turn, will struggle to satisfy enough voters. A failed Reform government could then push our politics back into its old comfort zone, or further away from the traditions of British democracy, into the unknown.Andy Beckett is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But I’m hankering after a sea sponge presented by a dolphinThu 25 Dec 2025 03.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 25 Dec 2025 03.25 ESTShareThis Christmas morning, are you worried you didn’t choose quite the right gift for that someone special? I always try my hardest, but everywhere I turn I’m bombarded with unhelpful suggestions. No, I don’t want a candle thatsmells like turkey, because, well, we’ll be cooking turkey. Nor do I want asunrise alarm clockthat mimics natural light, because I can leave the curtains open. And Idefinitelydon’twant a salmon DNA pink collagen jelly mask (Good Housekeeping’sBest for Beauty Lovers), because said DNA comes from milt. AKA semen. If I wanted fish sperm on my face, I would tickle some pollocks.So if, like me, you’re always looking for inspiration, my advice is: learn from the animal kingdom. Humans didn’t inventgifting. The practice has been around for at least100m years, long before our species evolved. With a little help from natural selection, this has given wild animals ample time to perfect the art of giving. Hell, some spiderseven gift-wrap!Excluding exercise-related items and other things I don’t like, there are five categories of Christmas gift: food, things for the home, bling, skincare and clothing. The animal kingdom has them all covered.Brazilian cuckoos give their partners high-protein snacks such asinsects, frogs and lizards, but if you like your meat shished, then the great grey shrike, also known as the butcher bird, has your back.Males impale prey, such as insects and mice, on sharp thorns and twigs to create artisan kebabs.Some insects gift their beaus spitballs, but these aren’t just any spitballs. These are scorpionfly spitballs, crafted with the freshest saliva from the engorged labial glands of only the fittest males. The delicacy is nutrient-dense, which is one of the reasons females prefer males with big balls.View image in fullscreenMale scorpionfly with a sizeable tail.Photograph: Ger Bosma/Getty ImagesAnother reason is that the fittest males make the biggest spitballs, and when I say “fit” I don’t mean “looks great in a leather jacket” (although they probably do). I mean “fit” in the genetic sense. The gifts are given as a prelude to sex, so by choosing the male with the biggest package, the female is also selecting genetic quality.She then consumes the delicacy duringsex but terminates intercourse as soon it’s all gone. Bigger spitballs mean longer copulation times, during which the male can transfer more sperm and the female can’t mate with anyone else. This explains why he bothers with such an elaborate offering.Adélie penguins don’t give food, but they do give things for the home. In Antarctica, where they live, there is no B&Q, so the birds must source their gifts from the local landscape. Each breeding season, males collect pebbles and start making a nest with them. The vital building blocks are scarce, prompting some chancers tosteal pebblesfrom their neighbours, but when a male gives a pebble to a female, it is a sign he is ready to commit. Think of it as the penguin equivalent of a diamond ring. The rock doesn’t go on her finger, however. If she also wants to get serious, she accepts the pebble and adds it to the nest. Then, after a few finishing touches, they are ready to start their family.Speaking of bling, crows excel at this gift category. There are many stories of people who have befriended wild corvids and then been given bottle tops, screws, buttons and other shinyitems in return. In Florida, Alberta and Chuck Holloway evenreceived a diamond braceletfrom a crow they fed regularly. This is particularly endearing because while mostanimals give presents in the hope of scoring (sound familiar?), crows apparently just enjoy giving.In Western Australia, meanwhile, dolphins have been spotted plucking clumps of sea sponge from the ocean floor and using them in interesting ways. Sometimes when they’re rummaging around for fish, theywear the spongeson their beak to help protect their skin. And sometimes, when males want to woo females, theydon them like jaunty hatsbefore presenting them as gifts.In so doing, dolphins brilliantly combine the last two categories of Christmas gift. Sea sponges are clothingandskincare. And if that’s not enough, when males give their sponge hats away, they often strike a U-shaped “banana pose” and play a little tune through their blowhole.This is not the half-arsed giving of domestic animals – my friend’s cat, Lilly, recently presented her with a dead mouse which she then stashed in an obscure corner of the house – or some people I could mention. Dolphin presents are thoughtful, multipurpose, sustainably sourced and delivered with panache. We can all learn from them. Mariah Carey may have said that all she wants for Christmas “is you”, but if I have one Christmas wish, it is to receive a sponge-hat-skin-protector thingy from a cetacean who serenades me with style.Helen Pilcher is a science writer and the author ofBring Back the King: The New Science of De-ExtinctionExplore more on these topicsAnimalsOpinionInsectsBirdsWildlifecommentShareReuse this content"

What kind of pervert are you?Katy GuestPlease don’t ever offer me cranberry sauce with my roast turkey – that’s just jam on your Christmas dinner, and who wants that?Thu 25 Dec 2025 01.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 25 Dec 2025 04.45 ESTShareAs a grumpy old woman in the prime of my pedantry, I have already died on many hills, and I have the scars to prove it. I have sacrificed myself on the battlefield ofpatriarchy chicken, by walking square into people who stride down the centre of the pavement staring at their phones and expecting everyone else to jump out of their way. I have risked life and limb in a pub full of football fans by declaring my belief that the only “real sports” are running fast, jumping high and throwing or swimming far – the rest are just “games”. And I have driven myself to tears by consistently walking into the same branch of Pret a Manger and ordering the same coffee, please, “and nothing else”, and then standing there blankly when I’m invariably asked, “And anything else?” When it comes to defending arbitrary red lines, my belligerence knows no bounds.And yet, with Christmas approaching, I have been trembling at the thought of strapping on my armour and fighting yet again for what I truly believe: that meat and fruit should never be served on the same plate. And yes, you perverts, I do mean turkey andcranberry sauce– just stop putting jam on your Christmas dinner!I know what you’re going to say: “But surely you don’t mean pork with apple sauce?” You bet I mean it. Bacon is for a sandwich and stewed apple goes in pie or in babies – they do not belong in the same bite. Oh, you’re thinking, but what aboutduck à l’orange? Put it down you weirdo, you’re not even French. It’s a hard no to lamb and redcurrant, a massive boak at mango chutney on curry, and I sincerely hope that no Guardian reader would think of whispering the obscene phrase “ham and pineapple pizza”.Everyone I meet is sure they can think of an exception to my rule. This week, colleagues have sidled up to me saying, “Coronation chicken?” Step away from me with your squishy raisins! Anything with figs? You’re so wrong. One sick person asked me to consider prosciutto and melon, except that he misspelt it “lemon” at first, so for a minute I actually considered it. Which would have been the thin end of the wedge.Don’t get me wrong, I love meat – ideally with gravy – andthenfruit, for pudding. I’ll adore you for offering me a crunchy green apple, a blackberry crumble, a banana for breakfast or raspberries any which way. Just keep it away from my dinner. Lamb belongs with mint, ham with mustard, and turkey (if you must) with a bucket of coleslaw. A burger, on the other hand, should be served with plenty of ketchup. Because a tomato identifies as a vegetable and should be accommodated as such – and that is a hill I will die on.Katy Guest is a Guardian Opinion deputy editor and astyle guideeditorExplore more on these topicsFoodThe hill I will die onFruitMeatSauces and graviescommentShareReuse this content"

Where other movies are playfully reimagining the backstories of famous villains, this one plays it straight, but with carefully curated revisionist tweaks.

Such a one, sadly, is this listless and supercilious musical – ostensibly on the theme of heartwarming home town values – which flatlines like a hedgehog run over by an 18-wheeler the moment the female lead opens her mouth to sing one of the film’s many terrible songs.”PBRead the full reviewAlphaWhat we said:“The madly, bafflingly overwrought and humourless storytelling can’t overcome the fact that everything here is frankly unpersuasive and tedious.

They open up on making amazing TV … and why morals matter more than nice handbagsRóisín LaniganThu 25 Dec 2025 01.00 ESTShareFew people are less daunted about the prospect of turning 30 than Lola Petticrew. “I used to be so afraid of getting old, and now I just think it’s the best thing ever,” they say. “I feel like I’m just coming into myself. And it feels fucking amazing. I think it’s such a fantastic thing to age – all the shit starts falling away and what you care about becomes more concentrated. I know what I want my life to be now, and I’m pretty stern on it. I don’t have to care about anything else.”They’re telling me this over Zoom from New York, where Petticrew is shooting Furious, the new show by Elizabeth Meriwether (New Girl, Dying for Sex). Petticrew plays a character who was sex-trafficked as a child and is now out for revenge, tailed by an FBI agent played by Emmy Rossum.The role is a departure for Petticrew – who also just signed on for Netflix’s new Assassin’s Creed adaptation. They’ve spent much of the past year playing two Irish women of the Troubles generation. In November 2024 they starred as IRA agent Dolours Price inSay Nothing, an adaptation of Patrick Radden Keefe’s true-crime book of the same name. And this November, in Channel 4’sTrespasses, they played Cushla Lavery, a young Catholic teacher who becomes involved with an older Protestant married man, with disastrous consequences. From those broad strokes of description, you might think there’s much to compare in the two roles, Petticrew’s biggest to date.“The two of them actually couldn’t be any different,” they say. “Which is why it was so funny when people said, ‘Oh, you’re doing another Troubles story!’ These stories, these characters couldn’t be more different. It’s a funny thing that’s preserved for Irish actors and Irish stories, for some reason. I’ve never heard anyone say to an American actor, ‘Oh, are you going to do another American one?’ Or an English person, ‘Oh, you’re doing another English one?’ So it’s very odd that when I, as an Irish actor, choose to tell back-to-back Irish stories, it’s seen as weird.”View image in fullscreen‘It’s very odd that when I, as an Irish actor, choose to tell back-to-back Irish stories, it’s seen as weird’ … Petticrew with Gillian Anderson in Trespasses.Photograph: WildgazeWhen Petticrew finds something odd, immoral or plain unfair, they will tell you so. They’ve used their platform over the past year to speak out in support of Palestine, to raise awareness for intergenerational trauma back home – like Dolours Price, they hail from westBelfast– and against classism and nepotism in the arts world. It’s a “posh boys’ club”, they tell me of acting in the UK and Ireland. “Nobody’s denying that these people are talented. What we’re talking about is making sure that working-class kids have the same opportunities so you don’t just end up with a bunch of one type of person in the arts – which is what we have. When I was growing up, it didn’t feel like a career in this industry was actually possible. When you come from wealth, you think that you can do anything. The world is open to you.”There is pressure on many young actors to soften the views that Petticrew espouses so passionately. In February this year, Petticrew won best actor at the Iftas (Irish Film andTelevisionawards) for their portrayal of Dolours Price, and used their speech to call out government inaction on the high rates of suicide in the north of Ireland for the generation who grew up in the aftermath of the Troubles – often termed “ceasefire babies”.View image in fullscreen‘People want you to be less mouthy, but it’s not being divisive. It’s being on the right side of history’ … Petticrew as Cushla with Tom Cullen as Michael in Trespasses.Photograph: Steffan Hill/Channel 4“There’s a sentiment from some people that I should be quiet and stop talking about it,” they say. “Wouldn’t it be lovely if I could shut up? I would love to do what other actors do and promote the thing and wear nice clothes and not have to think about all that. But it’s not a privilege that I have, unfortunately, because I can’t change the way that I grew up or where I’m from and the love that I have for it and the people who are being failed at every single avenue. If somebody’s giving me space to speak, it might as well be about something that matters.“People want you to be less mouthy and just be grateful. But it’s not being divisive. It’s being on the right side of history. And I just don’t think any bag in the world is worth shaking the morals that I have.”In Trespasses, Petticrew’s Cushla Lavery struggles with questions of morality and privacy, grappling with how to speak up for herself in a society that functions overwhelmingly on the basis of cultural omertà. Over the course of the series she learns to advocate for herself and for her community. It doesn’t necessarily stop her – or her love story – from being doomed. Although there’s eventual cautious hope for Cushla (and for the place she lives) at the end of the series – “giving the audience space to exhale”, Petticrew says of the show’s coda – her story remains tied up in the wider cultural story of the Troubles. “Cushla is quite able to stick up for herself, but there’s a softness in her,” says Petticrew, who devoured Trespasses, written by the Belfast author Louise Kennedy, and called her agent instantly to ask to audition for the role, even before the TV adaptation was picked up.View image in fullscreenPetticrew as Dolours Price in Say Nothing.Photograph: Channel 4“I suppose I knew both versions of these women,” they say of Cushla and Dolours. “I think that’s the thing about Irish people, isn’t it? We’re storytellers, and I think a lot of our houses are very matriarchal. And you quite often find yourself in situations, especially when you’re a kid, where it’s just a lot of women talking. I definitely grew up like that as well, and what a lovely way to grow up.”‘If you get it wrong, it’s sacrilegious!’ TV’s problem with Irish accentsRead moreIt’s unsurprising, then, that any chance they get, Petticrew will return home to their beloved west Belfast. That’s what they’re planning to do not long after we speak, boarding a plane back east just in time for Christmas (and their 30th birthday on 26 December). “I cannot wait,” they say. “I’ll be straight on that plane, straight to my house, straight on my sofa with my dog, getting a west Belfast Chinese.”What is a west Belfast Chinese, exactly? Well: salt and chilli chips with all the vegetables. Fried rice, chicken curry off the breast. Peas, fried onions, soft noodles with gravy. Then chicken balls, which are hollowed out and the batter filled with all of the aforementioned Chinese, which will be used much like a prawn cracker to dip into the curry sauce you’ve also ordered.Petticrew explains all this without taking a breath. I blink. It’s possibly the most divisive thing they’ve ever said. “If you do it once, you’ll do it every time,” they say, and it’s convincing enough to make me take their word for it.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionBelfastNorthern IrelandfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Ahead of this year’s offering of The Scarecrows’ Wedding, we ask: which is the all-time Christmas cracker?Michael HoganThu 25 Dec 2025 04.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 25 Dec 2025 04.02 ESTShareThey’re now as much a part of the Christmas Day schedules as the monarch’s boring speech and a bafflingly popular Mrs Brown’s Boys special. Animated adaptations of the picture books by authorJulia Donaldsonand illustrator Axel Scheffler have become a feelgood seasonal institution.It’s a cosy tradition that began with The Gruffalo in 2009 and has since become a festive fixture, taking pride of place on BBC One on Christmas afternoon. The voice casts are always impressively A-list, with Rob Brydon the only constant. This year’s kid-calmer is The Scarecrows’ Wedding, making it 13 entries in the canon and counting. But which is the all-time Christmas cracker? We’ve ranked them all from worst to best …13.The Smeds and the Smoos(2022)View image in fullscreenA snooze more like … The Smeds and the Smoos.Photograph: BBC/Magic Light PicturesWe know what we want from a Julia Donaldson creation: cute animals, magical settings and heartwarming bedtime stories with a gentle moral. What we don’t particularly want is a Romeo and Juliet-esque romance between a pair of different-coloured aliens from feuding families. Especially not ones told in sub-BFG nonsense language. The Smeds and the Snooze, more like.12.The Highway Rat(2017)A sweet-toothed rodent becomes a masked bandit and steals sugary treats but ultimately gets his comeuppance. Despite David Tennant voicing the peckish pest, this is Poundstretcher Pixar. The flirtatious rabbit is a weird flourish, like the makers are reliving their childhood crush on the Cadbury’s Caramel bunny. Besides, the buck-toothed rat looks more like a beaver. Ahem.11.Zog and the Flying Doctors(2020)This subpar sequel to the superior Zog sees the clumsy orange dragon and decidedly non-dashing knight Sir Gadabout try to rescue an ambitious princess who’s been locked up in her dastardly uncle’s castle. As a feminist riff on fairytales, it lacked plot twists and felt like reheated festive leftovers. Daniel Ings replaces Kit Harington as Gadabout, while Mark Bonnar pops up as Distressed Unicorn. Maybe the mythical creature foresaw his performance on The Celebrity Traitors.10.Tabby McTat(2023)This mini-drama about a busker and his singing cat is a rare Donaldson story to be set in London, rather than the bucolic countryside. Jodie Whittaker narrates, while Sope Dirisu and Susan Wokoma are adorable as the lovestruck felines. However, the twee capital city is somewhat Richard Curtis-fied from the book.9.Tiddler(2024)Last year’s offering is basically Finding Nemo with tartare sauce and a wedge of lemon. A sub-aqua saga follows a little fish with a big imagination who is forever spinning tall tales to excuse his lateness for sea school. When Tiddler gets lost in the wide open ocean, he’s saved by his own storytelling. Stunning underwater sequences, plus some knowing cameos, but it’s a predictable piscine yarn. Might also make grownup viewers feel guilty about that fish course during Christmas lunch.8.Superworm(2021)“See him wriggle! See him squirm! Hip hip hooray for Superworm!” A heroic tale about a long, strong annelid who keeps saving the day. Well, until he gets a bit full of himself, starts ignoring his friends and is captured by the evil Wizard Lizard. The cutesy anthropomorphism – earthworms don’t have eyes, guys! – is soon forgiven, thanks to narration from Oscar-winner Olivia Colman and Matt Smith as our slithery hero.7.The Scarecrows’ Wedding(2025)This year’s entry in the Christmas canon is a Worzel Gummidge-adjacent affair about two besotted turnip-heads planning their nuptials. That is, until a smooth-talking love rival puts them in mortal danger. Jessie Buckley and Domhnall Gleeson are charming as the straw-stuffed fiances, while Sophie Okonedo narrates. Small complaint: a crab randomly turns up on a farm that’s clearly inland. Sure, it’s not a wildlife documentary but give us some credit. We might be merry and slumped in a carb coma but we’re not daft.6.The Gruffalo’s Child(2011)This sequel sees the Gruffalo’s wilful daughter ignore her father’s warnings and venture into the deep dark wood in search of the fabled Big Bad Mouse. A neat reversal of the original’s plot, with a worthy message about conquering your fears and heeding parental advice. It loses points by being a little too cynically cute, not to mention its plot twist defying the laws of physics. It regains them for its snowy setting and gorgeously atmospheric glow.5.Zog(2018)View image in fullscreenThe OG … Zog, the dragon who must learn to fly.Photograph: BBCNot to be confused with Irish puppet twins Zig and Zag from the planet Zog. This is the scaly story of a keen pupil at Dragon School, desperate to learn how to fly, roar and breathe fire. If only he weren’t so accident-prone. When Zog makes friends with Princess Pearl, who dreams of being a doctor when she grows up, he discovers his true purpose. Slyly funny, subversive and full of subtle details, with a voice cast including Lenny Henry, Tracey Ullman, Kit Harington (riffing on his Game of Thrones persona) and scene-stealer Patsy Ferran. Puts the “OG” into Zog.4.The Snail and the Whale(2019)A plucky sea snail befriends a gentle humpback whale and rides his tail fin on an adventure around the world. Who hasn’t dreamed of that? An enchanting story of unlikely friendship with genuine jeopardy and an air punch-inducing rescue. Winningly narrated by Diana Rigg, and visually beautiful, it features Blue Planet-worthy sequences, while delivering watery wisdom about empathy and environmental awareness. Blubbery in both senses.3.Room on the Broom(2012)This stone-cold classic sees a kindly witch invite an array of animals to hop on to her broomstick, much to the annoyance of her jealous cat. A spellbinding ode to friendship, family and inclusivity. The scenes where they all whoosh off into the sky are surprisingly exhilarating. A classy voice cast includes Gillian Anderson, Sally Hawkins, Simon Pegg and Timothy Spall. No wonder it nabbed an Oscar nomination. Wallace and Gromit vibes. Compliments don’t come much higher.2.Stick Man(2015)Another total banger with a true Christmas edge, hence its high placing. This Homeric epic follows a happy-go-lucky father’s quest to make it back to his “family tree” in time for Christmas. Martin Freeman brings soul to the wooden stick, while Hugh Bonneville voices Santa and Jennifer Saunders narrates. The climactic scene on a sleigh is downright spine-tingling. You’ll never look at a stick the same way again. OK, you will. But not for a few hours after the credits roll.1.The Gruffalo(2009)The original, the best, the one that spawned an entire genre of Donaldsonvision. A toasty tale of a mouse strolling through the woods in search of an acorn, outwitting the predators trying to eat him. How? By casually announcing that he’s off to meet a monster. But as any yule fule kno, there’s no such thing as a Gruffalo. Is there? Extra poignancy is lent by the fact that three of the star voices – Robbie Coltrane, John Hurt and Tom Wilkinson – are no longer with us. They’re joined by James Corden and Helena Bonham Carter. It could only have been improved by casting soundy-likey actors Mark Ruffalo and Janeane Garofalo.The Scarecrows’ Wedding airs on BBC One and BBC iPlayer at 3.10pm on Christmas Day.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionChildren's TVJulia DonaldsonAnimation on TVfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It took director and writerMichael Mannjust five weeks to adapt Thomas Harris’s novel Red Dragon for the screen.But when it came to adapting his own work – Heat 2, co-authored withMeg Gardineras both a prequel and sequel to his 1995 film Heat – Mann discovered the pain of self-editing. “I thought OK, 10 weeks, 12 weeks,” he reflects in a Zoom interview from Los Angeles. “Instead, it took like 10 months and it was arduous because I wanted the same effect as the novel, which required recombining events to fit within a two-and-a-half-hour timeframe. That selection became agonising to say the least.”Heat at 30: Michael Mann’s electric crime thriller is a film of fire and sadnessRead moreAccording tomedia reports, Heat 2 will have a $150m budget after moving from Warner Bros to United Artists with a cast rumoured to include Christian Bale and Leonardo DiCaprio. Mann remains both tight-lipped and cautious. “Listen, no picture happens until it’s happening, but right now we’re looking to start August 3,” he says.For Heat devotees, it has been a long wait. When the three-hour crime epic was released30 years ago this month, the film industry was in different place. Blockbuster Video ruled the roost, Netflix did not exist, CGI was expensive and rare while AI was mostly the realm of science fiction. The big hits at the box office were Toy Story, Apollo 13, Die Hard With a Vengeance and GoldenEye.Notably, a report about Heat 2 onDeadline stated: “Filming in California for 77 days, Mann’s movie has projected it will hire 40 main cast members, 800 ‘base crew members’ and 1,350 background actors (not a lot of AI there).”It was a small but telling reminder that Mann is a Hollywood artisan, a traditionalist who graduated from the London Film School in 1967 and whose work contains a kinetic authenticity. But now AI is on the march, capable of generating convincing video. It was a bone of contention during a historic labour dispute in 2023 thatachieved some AI protections, though some artists were unhappy with the deal.View image in fullscreenAl Pacino in Heat.Photograph: Warner Bros./AllstarMann comments: “Everybody’s very concerned and interested in what’s possible with AI, from a very cautionary perspective among the Screen Actors Guild, Writers Guild and Directors Guild because it may turn into a new kind of performance.“Well, that performance has to be acted by an actor, written by a writer, and directed by a director regardless of whether the execution is from artificial generative intelligence or not. The other thing is that at the same time one observes that technology never goes backward. Then there’s issues of copyright ownership in which the studios are pretty much aligned with the creators like myself and other writers and actors and directors.”Recent upheavals have seenDisney buy fellow studio 21st Century Fox,Paramount merge with Skydance Mediaand, most recently, the streaming giant Netflix agree to buyWarner Bros in an $83bn dealthat still faces various obstacles, including a hostile takeover bid from Paramount. Some observers fear that victory for Netflix would result in fewer films gaining a theatrical release.“Unless someone has a crystal ball, there’s no way to know the outcome,” says Mann, “I know what I’d like the outcome to be but I’m hardly in the inner circle. I know [Netflix CEO] Ted Sarandos but I don’t know their thinking.“A more relevant question from an audience perspective is: what’s the inherent logic? The inherent logic is that, when you have a film like the new Avatar with Imax presentation or great Dolby laser with a fantastic sound system, people will come, they will flock to it. Is the pattern three years from now that the exhibition relies on becoming even more experiential, similar to concert venues?”Mann is a creature of cinema who has described Stanley Kubrick’sDr Strangeloveas a formative influence on his career. “I make films for a large presentation,” he adds.“My ambition is to very strongly and effectively impact the audience with the story with all the tools at my disposal to transport them into this world for two, two and a half hours. That’s what I’ve always wanted to do since I was in film school in London and so it’s a diminution for any of my – or any number of other directors I can think of – to have our films be seen 16-by-9 on an iPhone. The full power of performance and expression is what I make films for.”Heat, released on 15 December 1995, is a case in point. Set in Los Angeles, the film follows the parallel lives of a master thief, Neil McCauley, and a dogged detective, Lt Vincent Hanna, whose private life is equally dysfunctional.A key reason it has endured is the casting of Robert De Niro and Al Pacino as the opposite and equal protagonists. Mann recalls the idea came up over breakfast with his co-producerArt Linson. “I said, ‘Let’s think about who would be in it’; we said, ‘What about Bob, what about Al?’“It was an automatic ‘it’s a fantastic idea’. I mean, the two greatest actors of their generation! The intensity, the internal power that De Niro has and the exuberance, the ability for performance with which Al could imbue a character, because within the character of Hanna, there’s a certain burlesque he uses with informants to keep them off balance, because in real life all informants lie some of the time. So it’s a constant game to manage an informant, to keep him off balance, to get the information you want.”The cast also includes Val Kilmer, Jon Voight, Amy Brenneman, Ashley Judd and Diane Venora. Heat’s plot is based on the experiences ofChuck Adamson, a celebrated Chicago detective who hunted and eventually killed the real lifeNeil McCauley, a career criminal who had served eight years on the prison island of Alcatraz. Adamson became a friend and consultant to Mann.The director recalls: “He had great respect and regard for McCauley professionally. If you’re the kind of driven detective that Adamson was, it’s like being a rock climber and your aspiration is to free climb Half Dome. So the better the crew you’re working, the bigger the challenge.“He had a high regard for McCauley’s professionalism but also there was a certain discovered rapport between them because it was as if McCauley viewed aspects of life and how he modulated himself similarly to Adamson.“They were both supremely self-aware, disciplined, fully conscious people, nearly devoid of self-deception. At the same time, in an encounter, each would blow the other out of his socks without thinking twice about it. That was the attitude.”In 1963, Adamson spotted McCauley at a Chicago deli. Instead of arresting him, he invited him for coffee. Much of the dialogue in the film’s pivotal scene was taken directly from Adamson’s recollection of that meeting. Both men acknowledged they were professionals on opposite sides and that if they met again “around the corner”, they would have to kill each other.View image in fullscreenMichael Mann in 2023.Photograph: Matt Licari/Invision/APHeat’s dramatisation of that meeting in a diner marked the first time that De Niro and Pacino were together on screen, despite both being in The Godfather Part II but in separate time periods. They did notrehearse the scene,a decision made at De Niro’s suggestion to keep the tension genuinely fresh.Mann recalls: “That’s the pivotal moment, the nexus of the drama – and we all knew it. We discussed the scene, analysed the scene, even maybe paraphrased it a little in gentle discussion because we wanted complete understanding of the multiplicity of motivations behind each character’s wanting to observe each other, take in each other. Both characters knew that they’re subconsciously getting an intuitive sense of the opposite number because they’re likely to be in a confrontation.“Both have lethal intent. What they don’t expect but do discover is the rapport when they start talking about their private lives and Hanna talks about a dream he has of dead bodies sitting around the table staring at him with eight-ball haemorrhages from gunshot wounds. Then De Niro asks: ‘What do they say?’ Al says, ‘Nothing.’ They don’t talk.“Then De Niro expresses a dream about drowning, which basically translates into: does he have enough time for what he wants in life? It becomes very intimate – the intimacy of strangers. You don’t want to rehearse a scene like that. Everybody understands that the magic of one or two unique takes will happen and we all want that to happen spontaneously on camera, not in a rehearsal.”Another indelible scene is a downtown shootout with a gritty, visceral quality that AI would struggle to replicate. McCauley’s gang successfully rob a bank but have been betrayed and are ambushed. Facing massed ranks of police, they try to shoot their way out.Mann hired former SAS operativesAndy McNaband Mick Gould to train the cast in realistic firearms handling. “We blocked out here’s how this ambush would happen and here’s how they would react and assault it.“When I found the location in downtown LA, I blocked the choreography across two city blocks. They’re leapfrogging: one guy’s laying down rounds while the other is moving forward and, then, he lays down rounds, et cetera, and it keeps going. We trained at the LA county sheriff’s shooting ranges under appropriately rigid safety procedures and sheriff’s range masters.“The guys trained three days a week, mornings, for months to get that good. They could probably outshoot 95% of the [Los Angeles police department]. You discover very quickly as a director that actors have tremendous eye-hand coordination and a learning curve that’s like a hockey stick.”He adds: “For the actors, they were living it and were using full-load blanks during the filming, which reverberated off the glass walls of the urban canyons we were in. The initial sound of the rehearsals was so frightening that I threw maybe 10, 11 mics around the location and so we wound up using the sound recorded during the filming.“Traditionally the sound effects designer would build 60–70 tracks and you’d post-produce during three days of pre-dubbing the sound effects. I had an excellent sound designer,Lon Bender, but I discarded most of it and basically used the sound from the dailies.”View image in fullscreenAl Pacino and Robert De Niro in Heat.Photograph: Ronald GrantHeat ends with Hanna chasing McCauley to a vast, open field adjacent to the Los Angeles international airport runways. The setting is dark and industrial but periodically flooded with blinding light from passing planes and strobing runway markers. The two men play a high-stakes game of hide-and-seek among massive shipping containers and electrical boxes.Mann recalls: “I wanted to leave the audience in a kind of – to use a music analogy – fugue state because you empathise with McCauley and want him to get away with [his girlfriend] Eady. Then with Hanna you’re empathetic to his pursuit of McCauley. There’s no compromise between the two states. I worked to have both there at 100% in what is fated to be a lethal confrontation between the two from which only one would survive.”As a plane approaches for landing, the landing lights illuminate the field. McCauley prepares to ambush Hanna but, as he moves, the shifting lights cast his shadow on the ground in front of him. Hanna spots the shadow, whips around and fires first, killing McCauley.“Then there’s the grace note where Hanna holds his hand, recalling the parallel between them, almost as if McCauley is fortunate to ride into death in tactical contact with one of the only other people on the planet who understands him. That counterpoint is how I wanted to leave it and that tends to sustain in memory.”Explore more on these topicsMichael MannAl PacinoRobert De NiroAction and adventure filmsThrillersCrime filmsinterviewsShareReuse this content"

Such longevity is partly down to extra-commercial considerations, in that the series has a capacity for tickling adults’ funny bones – possibly even those now fully grown students – as well as the very young. Though it can’t claim anything quite as unexpected as the David Hasselhoff cameo in 2004’s TheSpongeBob SquarePantsMovie – not so much a high bar as an unforgettably wonky one – feature four thinks nothing of making Clancy Brown talk like a pirate while handing royalty cheques to Barbra Streisand and Yello. Anything can still happen in Bikini Bottom.Preceded by a festive short for Paramount’s other weathered babysitters, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, the new SpongeBob film soon settles into a familiarly goofy groove, its script a PG-rated treatise on the pros and cons of growth. This SpongeBob (once more voiced by Tom Kenny) is now 36 clams high, a source of particular excitement as this will allow him to ride the rollercoaster of his dreams. (One early, trippy laugh: our overexcitable hero’s imagined loop-the-loops.) As in the best contemporary American animation, though, the corkscrew plotting is the real rollercoaster. SB’s quest to obtain the fabled swashbuckler certificate that will prove him a “big guy” brings him into conflict with the Flying Dutchman, voiced by the suddenly ubiquitousMark Hamill.The Dutchman’s ship bumps up the scale, but mostly it’s the usual bricolage of digimation and hand-turned elements, forever foregrounding pleasing, properly cartoonish effects. SpongeBob wedges himself into an AC unit and somehow emerges squarer still; there’s a cameo from a pair of chattering joke-shop false teeth; and in a punishment guaranteed to resonate with the six-year-old crowd, our hero is subjected to endless washing-up. Whether its spitballing silliness will linger when the lights come up is debatable, but it’s a solid SpongeBob movie – and by far the funniest Pirates of the Caribbean movie, encompassing a hearty Davy Jones joke and a saltily suggestive catchphrase for SpongeBob’s pal Patrick: “The best guys are big guys.” Those students will be snickering anew.The SpongeBob Movie: Search for SquarePants is out on 19 December in the US, on 20 December in Ireland and on 26 December in Australia and the UK.Explore more on these topicsFilmAnimation in filmSpongeBob SquarePantsMark HamillComedy filmsComedyTelevisionreviewsShareReuse this content"

But 2026 begins with a very different true story, from someone who never chose the spotlight, but now wants some good to come of her appalling experiences. After the trial that resulted in her husband and 50 others being convicted of rape or sexual assault, Gisèle Pelicot’s aim is to nurture “strength and courage” in other survivors. InA Hymn to Life(Bodley Head, February) she insists that “shame has to change sides”. Another trial – of the men accused of carrying out the Bataclan massacre – was the subject of Emmanuel Carrère’s most recent book, V13. For his next,Kolkhoze(Fern, September), the French master of autofictionturns his unsparing lens back on himself, focusing on his relationship with his mother Hélène, and using it to weave a complex personal history of France, Russia and Ukraine. Family also comes under the microscope inGhost Stories(Sceptre, May) by Siri Hustvedt, a memoir of her final years with husband Paul Auster, who died of cancer in 2024.Hollywood isn’t totally out of the picture, though:The Steps(Seven Dials, May), Sylvester Stallone’s first autobiography, follows the star from homelessness in early 70s New York to Rocky’s triumph at the Oscars later that decade. Does achieving your creative dreams come at a price, though? Lena Dunham suggests as much inFamesick(4th Estate, April), billed as a typically frank memoir of how how her dramatic early success gave way to debilitating chronic illness. Frankness of a different kind is promised inMore(Bloomsbury, September), actor Gillian Anderson’s follow-up to her bestselling 2024 anthology of women’s sexual fantasies, Want.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Little, Brown Book GroupLikely to be somewhat less racy – though just as acutely observed – Alan Bennett’s diariesEnough Said(Faber, March) span the period 2016-2024, taking in such momentous events as Brexit and the death of the Queen, as well as a plague of molehills in Bennett’s garden. After relinquishing his mantle as host of In Our Time, Bennett’s near contemporary Melvyn Bragg travels back toAnother World(Sceptre, February), namely his three years at Oxford in the late 1950s. Curious Incident author Mark Haddon also looks to the past, this time to the 60s and 70s, in his quirkily illustrated coming of age memoir,Leaving Home(Chatto & Windus, February). David Sedaris’s latest collection of essaysThe Land and Its People(Abacus, July) includes such dispatches from his bucolic existence in Sussex as “I know you can’t hold animals to human standards … That said, rams are assholes.”We’ll have to see whether similarly intemperate outbursts are detailed in a major new biography ofGordon Brown(Bloomsbury, February), for which author James Macintyre was allowed “unique” access to the former prime minister’s personal archives. For his part, ex-home secretary and chancellor Sajid Javid will avoid dishing the dirt on recent governments, focusing instead on his childhood inThe Colour of Home(Abacus, February). And following her departure from the cabinet in September, Angela Rayner has decided to write a memoir – as yetUntitled(Bodley Head) – reflecting on her tough upbringing and path into politics, set to be released in the second half of the year.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Penguin Books LtdAway from life writing, North American heavyweights tackle the big ideas: inA World Appears(Allen Lane, February) by Michael Pollan, the author of How to Change Your Mind considers the small matter of consciousness – what is it, and how do you measure it? WithThe Beginning Comes After the End(Granta, March), Rebecca Solnit reminds us how revolutionary the past 60 years have been in terms of social change. She views the current turn towards authoritarianism as setback, rather than defeat. Doppelganger author Naomi Klein teams up with documentary maker Astra Taylor to describeEnd Times Fascism(Allen Lane, September), the “man-made Armageddon complex” built by religious fundamentalists, tech barons and nationalists that threatens democracy. Jared Diamond, the historian best known for Guns, Germs and Steel, returns with his first book in six years,Profits, Prophets, Coaches and Kings(Allen Lane, September), on the influence of charismatic individuals in politics, business, sport and religion. And Patrick Radden Keefe, whose Empire of Pain exposed the billionaire dynasty behind the opioid epidemic, investigates the mysterious death of a young man inLondon Falling(Picador, April).Following the extraordinary success of Adolescence, the Netflix show that showed the aftermath of a misogynistic killing, teenage masculinity remains front and centre. One of its stars, Stephen Graham, has teamed up with psychologist Orly Klein to compileLetters to Our Sons(Bloomsbury, October), a collection of fathers’ reflections on “what it means to be man”, including one from the actor himself. And inThe Castle(Viking, August),Jon Ronson embarks on a journey to discover exactly what led his son Joel to attend a mysterious event at a multi-millionaire’s mansion in New England, in the process uncovering “a world of unmoored men on a desperate search for purpose”.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Hodder & StoughtonI was going to say Liza Minnelli’s memoir may provide some light relief, but the Cabaret star’s life has contained at least as much tragedy and heartache as it has spotlights and sequins. Still, you’ll be able to read about both inKids, Wait Till You Hear This!, “as told to” her friend and singer Michael Feinstein – though if you’re expecting a studiedly neutral account, you might have to wait a bit longer: the emphasis is on “dispelling tabloid myths and setting the record straight”. A lower-key but no less interesting musical star, David Byrne, brings us his first proper book since 2012’s How Music Works,Sleeping Beauties(Canongate, October). The title refers to works of art or inventions that are ignored at the time but resurface after years of dormancy – from Bruegel to antiseptics. Finally, inTonight the Music Seems So Loud(Picador, June), journalist Sathnam Sanghera takes a break from empire to explore just what it was that made enigmatic pop genius George Michael such an influential cultural figure, 10 years after his death at the age of 53.To browse and preorder the titles in the 2026 lookahead, visitguardianbookshop.com.

In a superbly imagined right-angled world that runs on its own surreal logic, siblings Henry (Sebastian Hansen) and Natalie (Emma Myers) – guided by Jason Momoa’s ex-gamer, Garrett, and Jack Black’s salesman, Steve; a double act without a straight man – have to use their construction skills to defeat baddies from the Nether.

Ostensibly this is about entertainers tasked with saving a failing Vermont inn from closure, but really it’s just an excuse for someone to make a movie out of Irving Berlin’s famous song.

The production expertly toyed with audience expectations, weaponising the very genre tropes that fans have come to anticipate. Ultimately, the show’s genius lay in its finale. Rather than a grim twist, the doors of No 9 closed with a defiant, glitzy Hollywood musical high-kicking routine. A joyous, unexpected celebration of showbiz cementing the production’s status as a triumph of meta-theatre.Phil Dukes, 56, BrightonRohtkoBarbican, LondonI went into Łukasz Twarkowski’s Rohtko unsure about the four-hour commitment, but it ultimately left me astonished. The production’s constantly shifting, ingeniously constructed sets and inventive live-filming techniques were unlike anything I’ve seen on stage. The narrative – by turns surreal, chaotic and strangely moving – pulled me in completely, and the score elevated every moment. It was an audacious, immersive experience that held my attention from start to finish.Jill Osborne, 52, LondonExe MenExeter Northcott theatreAshley Pharoah’s play is a perfect encapsulation of the importance of regional theatre: a superbly written and brilliantly acted production that, while holding a layer of appeal for those familiar with Exeter Chiefs rugby club, was still compelling for those from further afield. Enough exposition for the unfamiliar without derailing the plot or distracting from the characters. Triumphant.Owen, BathFat HamSwan theatre, Stratford-upon-AvonI’m a playwright and novelist living in the beleaguered US, who attends London theatre annually. Fat Ham was exhilarating and delightful. Having seen Andrew Scott as Hamlet, I feel I’ve seen the best of that play as well as the best rethinking of it. The last scene was shocking in a good way, brilliantly performed and exciting.Georgia B Rhoades, Louisville, Kentucky, USEvitaLondon PalladiumIt was the most thrilling show about authoritarianism I’ve ever seen, drawing the audience into the allure of power. Rachel Zegler was a force of nature, seducing the audience outside from the balcony, even as she mocked them inside. Diego Andres Rodriguez as Che paired with her in a classic love-hate relationship, like a sadomasochistic Fred and Ginger, which was simultaneously fierce and funny, even as Zegler’s Evita used Juan Perón as a tool to realise her ambitions. The front row had a perfect view, too, and was offered as a £20-£25 bargain to early bookers. I’ll never forget this production.Steve, LondonView image in fullscreenRachel Zegler sings Don’t Cry for Me Argentina on a balcony outside the London Palladium.Photograph: Jordan Pettitt/PALost LearTraverse, EdinburghA transcendent experience at the Edinburgh festival. Without a doubt, Venetia Bowe’s lead performance was the best thing I have ever witnessed on stage.

The performances and staging, which included some brilliant animation scenes, were fantastic. It was extra special to share the experience with my mum, who has been going to see the WNO since the early 80s.Beth Charles, 52, SalfordThe Brightening AirOld Vic, LondonA great experience: the actors were incredibly good and the play was so intriguing that it had me on the edge of my seat. The dialogues were witty and suspenseful and some surprises in the plot got me thinking. But above all, I found the characters and their interaction really moving.

To take such a well-known story and make it feel so exciting and overwhelming (in a good way!) was a very pleasant surprise.Marko Blanusa, BracknellThe Fifth Step@sohoplace, LondonA stunning script perfectly acted by Jack Lowden and Martin Freeman. There was a tremendous chemistry between the two actors. I also thought the use of the stage was brilliant.

As a new rash of reissues arrives, 80s stalwarts Lip Cream, Death Side and the Nurse recall the thrills and threatsAlex DellerThu 25 Dec 2025 06.00 ESTShareAfew short years after punk’s initial shock-and-awe inspired thousands of teenagers to spike their hair and learn three chords, the genre mutated into hardcore: a leaner, meaner and fiercely independent hybrid that would soon be tearing up squats, church halls and dive bars around the world.Forty-five years on,hardcore is enjoying a momentin the mainstream thanks to bands such as Turnstile, Speed and Knocked Loose. There are hardcore bands on talkshows, in fast-food ads and on $40 T-shirts – all things that the 1980s artists would probably have gobbed at.Anyone longing for hardcore’s original underdog spirit may be minded to look toJapan, and a range of newly reissued albums that document the early hardcore scene there. “It was extremely violent and frightening,” says Ishiya, frontman of the band Death Side, one of Japanese hardcore’s linchpin acts (he and many of his punk peers reject surnames or use stage names). “At every gig, someone would be beaten bloody, and you never knew when it might be your turn. That tension was something you could never experience in ordinary life – it was thrilling.”Tokyo alone was home to a huge array of foundational acts such as GISM, Gauze, the Comes and the Execute – and later Death Side, Bastard and Tetsu Arrey – all playing some of the most furious, exciting punk of the late 1980s and early 90s. But for all the sense of camaraderie the bands found on stage, on tour and in the sweaty, volatile crowds, being a punk in Japan could nevertheless be isolating.“Our basic stance was to rebel against society and ‘common sense’, so of course we chose a look that mainstream society wouldn’t accept,” says Ishiya, who used to sport a towering magenta mohawk. “In Japan, the pressure to conform is extremely strong, and we were subjected to discriminatory treatment just for looking different. On trains people avoided us, and when we looked for work, we were screened out. We were treated like enemies of society.”View image in fullscreen‘Pressure to conform is extremely strong’ … Punks in Osaka in the sumner of 1985.Photograph: Corbis/VCG/Getty ImagesOne of the earliest bands on the scene was Lip Cream. Bassist Minoru Ogawa used to hang out at the Japanese record store chain UK Edison “digging through the few hardcore records they had” and asking staff for recommendations, eventually alighting on western hardcore originators such as Discharge, Chaos UK, Dead Kennedys and Disorder: “I was always looking for fast rhythms.”He had already cut his teeth with the Comes, a raw, scything punk act whose enigmatic singer Chitose had been inspired by the Damned and the Stranglers, who he saw on a trip to London. Ogawa quit, but was then asked whether the Comes might provide tracks for a compilation LP. “I just made something up on the spot: ‘We’ll do it! We’ve actually got a new band!’ I randomly said: ‘We’re called Lip Cream.’”To make good on his word, Ogawa drafted in Aburadako drummer Maru and ex-Comes guitarist Naoki, and the band eventually released four albums containing some of the era’s most scintillatingly out-of-control thrash. “Everything I’d experienced in the Comes ended up turning into this stronger drive with Lip Cream,” says Ogawa. “It wasn’t that I wanted to changewhatI did – I just wanted to keep moving.”Listen to Lip Cream: SinElsewhere, a shorter-lived act called the Nurse were also making their mark as one of the world’s first all-female hardcore bands. Aged 16, singer Neko – a fan of GBH and Discharge – recruited members through Doll, a Japanese magazine. “My family was against me playing punk music,” she says, and they were surprised when she would leave the house “wearing heavy, eccentric makeup and strange fashion. I’d go to gigs at Tsubaki House in Shinjuku, and it caused problems when I’d stay out late.”In this first rush of Tokyo noise, Ishiya’s band Death Side released two landmark albums, a split release with Ishiya’s idols Chaos UK and a scattering of EPs, all between 1987 and 1994. “It was the feeling of: ‘I want to do something myself.’ A punk band was something anyone could do,” he says. “I got an instrument cheaply and practised, couldn’t manage it, and decided to be the vocalist. Hardcore punk was perfect for expressing the hopeless anger of my teenage years.”View image in fullscreenLip Cream on stage in 1984.Photograph: © Dynamite RecordsIshiya has a number of theories about why violence was so prevalent on the scene, ranging from a traditional samurai worldview to the country’s post-second world war trauma. Other reasons are more prosaic. “Basically, people who couldn’t fit into this thing called society – school, companies and so on – were all labelled delinquents,” he says. “When those kinds of people gather together, I think violence naturally breaks out.”This inclination was then magnified by bands such as GISM, whose frontman Sakevi had form for attacking journalists and wielding a flamethrower on stage. “Because of GISM’s violent performances there was a sense that hardcore gigshadto be violent,” says Ishiya. “It made gigs a kind of extraterritorial space where ordinary rules didn’t apply.”All these people seemed crazy, so I thought I’d be a crazy person tooThe problems came when the punks stepped back into regular society. Zigyaku, guitarist of the bluntly named Bastard, was shut out of venues and jobs, and unable to rent a room because of his appearance. He had played with Gudon and Half Years in Hiroshima before moving to Tokyo, where he instantly became enamoured of the city’s chaotic pace. “The first thing I felt was that everyone was just flying,” he laughs. “All these people seemed crazy, so I thought I’d be a crazy person too. There were so many hardcore bands; there were gigs all over the place every week. Time passed so quickly. It was like Ryūgū-jō in Japanese folklore” – a tale where the story’s hero visits the dragon god Ryūjin’s temple for what appears to be a few days, only to return home to find that centuries have passed.View image in fullscreen‘At every gig, someone would be beaten bloody’ … Death Side.Photograph: Courtesy: La Vida Es Un MusBut as well as his day-to-day difficulties, there were others as Bastard bulldozed their way across the country, incinerating audiences with the gristly, invincible-sounding hardcore they perfected on their 1992 album, Wind of Pain. “Bastard was never a violent band, but we still had a lot of trouble,” he says. “Punks are conspicuous, so they are easily noticed by the police and yakuza gangsters. On Bastard’s tour with Cruck, Mad Conflux and Pile Driver, there were troubles in every city.” Nevertheless, like Ishiya, Zigyaku apparently wouldn’t have it any other way. “Being a punk makes you a minority, and there’s value in that,” he says. “If more than half of Japan’s population became punk, I think it would be a more disgusting world!”Go hard or go home: why is hardcore punk enjoying a renaissance?Read moreFor all their close proximity, each of these bands maintained a distinct sound and identity. “There was a sense of rivalry but I think it was more like sharpening one another,” says Ishiya, who is now an author and punk historian. “It was a wonderful relationship where we would collide head-on and raise each other up.” This wild individualism was reflected elsewhere in Japan, with bands such as Confuse, Disclose, SOB, Mobs, Crow and Nightmare all twisting hardcore into strange, aberrant shapes.As towhythese bands were so original, most of the players offer little more than a shrug by way of response. Ishiya, however, finds a specific reason. “The musical lineage differs from that of overseas,” he suggests. “Abroad, rock plays in ordinary households, but in Japan in the 60s or 70s such a thing was unthinkable.” He highlights how Japanese music is instead rooted in gentle forms such as geinō kayōkyoku, enka and folk – meaning that punk was always going to burn even brighter in Japan. “If one rebels, one will likely move in a unique direction.”Lip Cream’s full back catalogue is available via Relapse Records.
