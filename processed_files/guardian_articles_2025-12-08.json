And he said: ‘Every time you refresh, it’s adding 500 followers.’ So I had to try to get to the top of the hill with the phone to check for myself.”A personal trainer from Berkshire who began posting her fitness classes online at the start of lockdown in 2020, Idiens, 53, had already built a respectable following.But after one video offering guidance on getting toned summer arms was picked up by a US fitness account, that number rocketed to 50,000 – and beyond. “I post it every year now as a bit of a tribute,” she jokes. “It was that reel that launched me into a whole new market.”Today, as@carolinescircuits, she has 2.3 million followers on Instagram, more than 70,000 onTiktokand 50,000 onYouTube, and a book,Fit at 50, that was a recent Sunday Times bestseller – making her a key influencer in an increasingly important demographic for social media platforms: those in midlife and older.If you want to grow your reach on social media, figures suggested this week, you could do worse than target the over-55s.Research from media analysts Ampere found it was people in the 55 to 64 age bracket who were delivering the highest growth inYouTubetraffic, up 20% since 2020 in the US and 14% in the UK. Tiktok, too, has had a 16% rise in British users in this age bracket in the past year.View image in fullscreenValerie Mackay has gained 312,000 followers onTiktokand almost 1 million onInstagramas @embracingfifty.“We’ve been seeing this trend over the last few years where older audiences who have traditionally [focused on] linear and broadcast TV have been digitising,” says Minal Modha, the head of Ampere’s consumer research division.“And by getting access to things like smartphones and smart TVs in particular, it’s opening up a whole new world for them.” More than half of US adults in the age bracket now watch influencer videos weekly.Some of them will be tuning in to Valerie Mackay from Inverness, who as @embracingfifty has gained 312,000 followers onTiktokand almost 1 million onInstagramsince she started her warmly chatty account eight years ago.“In hindsight, I wouldn’t have picked that name ’cause I’m now 62 and stuck with it. But the point of the name was I was embracing life over 50. I had two children, they had both left home and I was enjoying life with myself and my husband, it was like freedom.”She founded her account after overhearing a woman asking what was the point of makeup and style after a certain age. “I just thought, well, what’s the point in life? Just dress and be who you want to be.”Mackay says she tries not to think about the huge numbers watching her from around the world – many of whom share an interest in the Scottish weather.“I get asked a lot: ‘I’m coming to Scotland, what do I wear?’ Which it’s difficult for me to answer because I might be flitting about in a trench coat and they might need big coats.”Mark Lidster is a 62-year-old from north London who posts videos as FitnessGeezer onYouTubeand Instagram, attracting up to 1m views. “There are a lot of guys out there getting to 40, through to 70, 80 – who relate and take inspiration from what I’m doing,” he says.View image in fullscreenMark Lidster, AKA FitnessGeezer, says he tries to create a community feel.Photograph: Mark LidsterLike Mackay, Lidster says actively engaging with his audience is crucial. As well as becoming more savvy with tech, he says, “people of that age are feeling more disconnected from society, and getting lonelier.Social mediais another way of feeling part of something – I try to create that community feel.”The crucial thing with 50-somethings and older is “to keep it genuine”, says Idiens, who is 53.“The biggest thing about social media in this age bracket is trust,” she says.“It has to be genuine – we are a little bit older and wiser, and what the audience are really looking for are people that they can trust with advice. For the midlife demographic, they also really love that sense of community.“Even with an audience of 2 million, I still think, when I’m putting up a post, that it’s going to my friends and family group. And the feedback I get is that [my followers] still feel like I’m a PT [personal trainer] in their sitting room – which, for me, is everything. That’s what I want.”Explore more on these topicsYouTubeSocial mediaDigital mediaInternetFitnessMidlakeMiddle agefeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s a rare Monday morning in whichNigel Faragedoesn’t pop up somewhere in central London to give a press conference.Even when he has nothing new to announce, he usually has no shame in saying something he’s said before many times. He likes the attention. Makes him feel valued. Satisfies his rampant narcissism. Speaking in a Commons statement with only a few MPs present on either side of the chamber doesn’t touch the sides.So you would have thought that this Monday of all Mondays Nige would have called his weekly presser. Because there’s so much he must want to talk about. Theallegations of electoral fraud in his Clacton constituency. The fallout from Nathan Gill, Reform’s erstwhile leader in Wales, taking bribes to speak on behalf of the Russians. Not least because it appears to be contagious, with several other Ukip/Brexit party/Reform members in the frame.There’s also the racism and antisemitism from his time at school. Not to mention the row he’s started with the BBC.But no. Nige has unexpectedly taken a vow of silence. Perhaps that’s a blessing to us all. Though think of what we are missing. An explanation of how of all 650 MPs, he was the politician least likely to have filed inaccurate accounts. A detailed slideshow of where all the money came from and how it was spent. We would expect nothing less of Farage. A man who has always done everything by the book.As for the racism, that would have easily been dealt with. The 28 other Dulwich pupils had all collectively got the wrong end of the stick. When he had pointed out to a black boy thatAfrica was that way, he had only been trying to help. He had thought the boy was genuinely lost and needed directions. Continue on the South Circular as far as the A2 and then fuck off to Dover.And his fallout with the BBC was easily explained. Nige was just a regular woke guy. He had never been one of those free speech fanatics who stood up for Bernard Manning. There wasn’t a show he didn’t want to cancel.Still, politics abhors a vacuum. So the Monday central London press conference went to Kemi Badenoch as, flanked by survivors and family members,she proposed new terms of reference for the rape gangs inquiry. “I am here to offer my help,” she said. “This is not a party political issue. I want to work on a cross-party basis.”This almost sounded like a genuine offer. Except no sooner had these sentences escaped her lips than she started to slag off all the other parties. The government lacked the political courage. Were too afraid to tackle questions of ethnicity. As for the Lib Dems, Reform, the Greens, the SNP and Plaid Cymru, they had nothing to say about the rape gangs at all. So as far as Kemi was concerned they were complicit in the abuse. Siding with the rapists. This was Kemi in cross-party action. About as giving and collegiate as she gets.“I just want to be helpful,” she sobbed. Even Chris Philp, who had been brought along almost entirely as decoration, seemed taken aback by this. Life is one long competition for Kemi. And often the person she is competing against is herself.While sympathetic and compassionate to the victims, the media were understandably sceptical about Kemi’s motives. Sky pointed out that Sajid Javid had tried and failed as home secretary to establish an inquiry in 2018. These things were difficult. So was she saying the Tory party was also guilty of letting down survivors?Kemi shook her head. She wasn’t saying that at all. She wanted to work in a cross-party fashion just so long as everyone understood the Conservatives had always done their best and Labour and the other parties were to blame.Others wanted to know if Kemi had reached out to other parties before calling the press conference. It might have been more constructive to build bridges than to go it alone. After all this wasn’t being billed as a “Grooming Gangs” press conference. It had been advertised as a Conservative one.Now, Kemi started to get narked. “I don’t have time to jump on a far-right bandwagon,” she snapped. Which was odd. Partly because no one had hinted that this might be a far-right bandwagon. But mainly because these are precisely the bandwagons that attract her.Meanwhile, Keir Starmer was getting down with the kids. Boasting about how he was now not only on TikTok but he was the first world leader to have his own Substack account. It can’t be long before he also has his own podcast. Almost as if he is having a late midlife crisis. Perhaps he will soon have his own YouTube chatshow. He’s heard thatLiz Truss’s has been a tremendous success. A collector’s item. Much like Keir’s Substack.“Dear Young People.“You are probably wondering why I am writing a Substock. I mean Substack. It is because I want to be down with the millennials and gen Z. Six-Seven. I want to communicate with you. To give you an insight into the real Keir. I want you to know that ‘Everything I do, I do it for you’. As Bryan Ferry once said. Six-Seven.“I want to tell you a story about Stacey. Stacey is the mother of two young children who struggles to put food on the table. Now I care about Stacy. Though not enough to be bothered to spell her name right consistently. Now Stacey also works. And here’s the thing.Six-Sevens of children in poverty come from working families.That’s so important, which is why I’ve written in italics.“Here’s a graph. It shows the effects of the two-child benefit cap. Oh, sorry. That’s the one of my popularity ratings falling. Six-Seven. But things are going to be great. Soz about the tax rises, but that’s better than austerity or borrowing. Liz Truss did that and now she’s a YouTube superstar.”Anyway. Enough from me for now.

But his music is quite different: a slippery layer cake of samples, multitudinous keys and lo-fi pop production, with Brown singing of a world where “the ebb and flow isn’t ebbing right”, be it in love or civic life. There is still room for an instant-classic R&B ballad though, in Tossed Away.Ben Beaumont-Thomas49Rochelle Jordan – Through the WallEverything isjust soon the British Canadian producer’s sixth album: expensively plush deep house suggesting club lights low, gleaming mirrors, potent looks igniting across the dancefloor. As much as the cold beat and ballroom flow of Ladida or the slapping “body, body, body” incantations of On 2 Something suggest a steadfast commitment to abandon, Jordan maintains impeccable poise and control throughout, whether in diva mode on Words 2 Say, breaking hearts on Bite the Bait, standing up for her needs on Doing It Too (“I’m not too much / You just give too little”) or patiently waiting for a frustrated lover to see the light on Ladida. Commanding, wise and committed to atmospheric excellence, party hosts don’t come better.Laura Snapes48Jerskin Fendrix– Once Upon a Time … in ShropshireView image in fullscreenHarebrained prog cabaret … Jerskin Fendrix.Photograph: Tim GuttJerskin Fendrix’s high-profile scores for the last three Yorgos Lanthimos films can’t really help prime you for the Midlands composer’s eccentrically beautiful second album, which pairs pristine musical theatre with the harebrained prog cabaret of Faith No More and (particularly) the under-sung Morphine. At first, Once Upon a Time … casts the rural bliss of growing up in 00s Shropshire in a golden light, a haven of getting ratted on Baileys and listening to Kanye on a farm, then having a lovely hungover group breakfast in someone’s kitchen. But the unexpected deaths he has experienced in recent years intrude to spoil paradise, eliciting feverish, absurdist expressions of grief – Jerskin Fendrix Freestyle is a bravura wig-out – and fathomless devastation from his camp, craggy voice. It demands a full theatrical production.LS47Clipping– Dead Channel SkyClipping frontman Daveed Diggs is best known for being in the original cast of Hamilton, and for all that this album is filled with noisy industrial rap, you can easily imagine it being successfully adapted for the Broadway stage. Dead Channel Sky is set in a cyberpunk dystopia not dissimilar to the scorched-sun “real world” of the Matrix, humming with janky tech and populated with fascists and freaky hedonists. Producers William Hutson and Jonathan Snipes render it in acid squiggles and revving breakbeats, while Diggs delivers his mutoid poetry like a prophet jacked up on some amphetamine he’s synthesised in a backstreet lab.BBTTell us your favourite albums of 2025Read more46The Tubs – Cotton CrownIn different hands,the Tubs’ second album might be a crushing listen, and understandably so. In 2014, frontman Owen Williams’ mother, the songwriter and author Charlotte Greig,died by suicide. Grief, as these songs detail, made him a rubbish boyfriend. But Cotton Crown is often funny and ardent, and especially self-aware about how new love might feel like a life raft to a depressed mind ill-equipped to reciprocate: “Know it’s all in my brain / Caught in the middle of loving you and being insane,” Williams sings on Fair Enough. His striking voice, somewhere between Richard Thompson and Bob Mould, bolts through the band’s joyful jangle-pop. Clear students of the form, they’re virtuosos with zero patience for perfection, their riffs hurtling and plundering like seagulls going at a spilled catch as they vigorously rough you up with profundity.LS45Smerz – Big City LifeView image in fullscreenAn album of stilted beauty … Smerz.Photograph: Alva Le FebvreCatharina Stoltenberg and Henriette Motzfeldt feel like the pop girlies of the incredibly prolific and off-kilterCopenhagen Rhythmic Music Conservatory scene, making music that’s more outward-facing and arch than some of their insular and traditional (and equally great) classmates. Their second album lurches between throwing yourself at life – “you’re a girl in the city and you shouldn’t think twice”, they chant in deadpan harmony on Roll the Dice – and actually thinking twice quite a lot in existential spirals about purpose and desire. The dissonance between confidence and anxiety comes through in the album’s stilted beauty: one minute, their whorls of prepared piano carry you along like clouds amid perfectly turned pop-R&B and balladry; then they stab and stutter, like cracks in the pavement destined to trap your heels. In 2023, K-pop’s brightest hopes NewJeans hired them as co-writers: more pop bearing their imprint can only be a good thing.LS44Sabrina Carpenter – Man’s Best FriendReleased almost exactly a year after her superstar-minting breakthrough Short n’ Sweet, and using a palette of soft rock, 80s pop, light disco and yearning country melodies, Carpenter added rich colour to one of pop’s most distinctive self-portraits. Her blatant sexuality is offset by an ironising sense of camp and a deep streak of cynicism, as she wonders whether to wrap her little finger round a series of hot but useless men. But whether dialling her exes while hopped up on “go-go juice” or being toxic for the sport of it (“you think that I’m gonna fuck with your head / well, you’re absolutely right”), Carpenter knows she’s part of the problem. Her fake helplessness at her own worst impulses is just one part of a formidable screwball comedy arsenal – she’s a Rosalind Russell for the dating app era.BBT43Jennifer Walton – DaughtersView image in fullscreenBolt from the blue … Jennifer Walton.Photograph: Liam CosfordThis Sunderland producer’s previous work included one EP of power electronics, one of antic club tracks, collabs with Aya and 96 Back as Microplastics, gigging with Kero Kero Bonito and a smattering of other credits. So her staggering, fully formed songwriterly debut was a total bolt from the blue. A swarming orchestral epic with shades of Julia Holter and Phil Elverum, it addressed her grief for her late father in serenely surrealist images – hitting a deer with a car in the middle of the night – and the painfully mundane realism of sitting in hospital corridors together. The standout Miss America combined both to stunning effect, a numbed incantation of everything Walton had seen on the US trip where she learned of her father’s diagnosis, the familiar now remade horribly mythic.LS42Erika de Casier– LifetimeErika de Casier’s fourth album updates the Y2K R&B template that fought for body-to-body sensuality in the face of rising digital creep. The old-school dial tones that pierce Lifetime’s rapt, liquid atmosphere work both as Janet homage and ironic sigh at how good those forebears had it when emotional warfare could only be conducted via pager: “Took a screenshot so / I could look at your pretty face all the time now / Without a sign that I’m online,” de Casier sings on earworm Delusional, a low-slung anthem for contemporary dating anxiety. “Hit midnight / Not even a text to hold me warm,” she rues on The Chase. That’s one of the most inviting things about Lifetime: its seductively cool surfaces conceal de Casier frantically kicking her feet below the surface, just like the rest of us.LS41Danny Brown – StardustThe Detroit rapper’s first post-rehab record totally disprovedhis fearsthat sobriety makes artists boring. On Stardust, Brown is still hard-wired with cartoonish verve, coupled with a genuinely touching sense of gratitude: “Sleeping real good at night ’cos I’m proud of myself,” he raps on Book of Daniel. While you probably wouldn’t describe someone who ponders “going bonkers and knocking out your chompers” as a wise elder, his hunger for life, opportunity and unmediated sensation blares through in how evidently gagged he is to centre younger producers from the digicore and hyperpop undergrounds: his unruly kids 8485, Jane Remover, Underscores, Frost Children and more make Stardust trip with glitch, rave, squealing riffs and overdriven noise. The rare record that makes you want to riot and shed a smiling single tear emoji.LS40-31 coming soonCome back tomorrow for the next 10 albums in the countdown!"

Unless something utterly remarkable happens, Mohamed Salah has played his last game for Liverpool. Left out of the starting lineup for each of the last three matches,he trained on Mondayafter his extraordinary post-match tirade followingthe 3-3 draw with Leedsbut he has not been selected for the Champions Leagueagainst Inter on Tuesday. He may or may not be with the team for Saturday’s game at Anfield against Brighton (“I don’t know if I am going to play or not but I am going to enjoy it,” he said). After that, he will be in Morocco for the Africa Cup of Nations with the Egypt national team and the transfer window will have opened by the time the tournament is over.How has it come to this? Salah is one of Liverpool’s all-time greats. He lies behind only Ian Rush and Roger Hunt in their all-time goalscoring charts. Across all clubs, only Alan Shearer, Harry Kane and Wayne Rooney have scored morePremier Leaguegoals. He played a key role in two Premier League titles and a Champions League. He’s won the Premier League Golden Boot four times and been named player of the year three times by both his fellow players and soccer writers – including last year. He’s only 33 and there has been no obvious sign yet of him fading with age.

Alexander-Arnold went; the other two stayed. None, it’s fair to say, have especially enjoyed what followed. Van Dijk suddenly looks ordinary, hisaura diminished. Alexander-Arnold has started only five league games for Real Madrid and has not looked comfortable. And Salah has seemed distant and disconnected. He’s scored only three non-penalty league goals and, worse, has shown no signs of forming an on-field relationship with theother forwardsLiverpool have brought in, while being in part responsible for the problems down the right flank given his inability or unwillingness to track.It’s a reminder, perhaps, that a huge part of how good a player looks is the system they’re playing in. Salah, Alexander-Arnold and Jordan Henderson worked as an almost perfect three on Liverpool’s right. Alexander-Arnold could release Salah with his quick accurate passes, which forced opposing left-backs to stay deeper, lessening the defensive burden on Alexander-Arnold, who could drift into a playing-making role in midfield, while Henderson had the stamina and tactical intelligence to offer cover. Last season Dominik Szoboszlai, while obviously a very different player than Henderson, was able to fulfill a similar role in terms of his energy and tracking.But that coherence has been shattered this season. The attempt to switch to 4-2-3-1 has demanded more defensive work on the right and Salah has been unable to provide that. He has seemed at times resentful of the changes, at one point posting on X: “How about we celebrate the great signings without disrespecting the PL champions?” in response to a Liverpool fan account celebrating the “upgrade” from Darwin Núñez and Luis Díaz to Alexander Isak and Florian Wirtz. It’s not just about manager Arne Slot’s attempts to transition to a new style. The impact of the death of Diogo Jota cannot be overlooked; Salah stayed back on the pitch after the opening game of the season, wiping away the tears with his cuff as the Kop sang their tribute.Africa Cup of Nations shunted into margins as greedy game finds no room at top table | Jonathan WilsonRead moreWhatever the reason, Salah has not played well this season and in that regardhis reaction to being droppedis troubling. Does he feel time sapping at him? The degree of paranoia seemed striking: insisting an unnamed person at the club is trying to force him out, naming Jamie Carragher, and claiming he is treated more harshly than Kane, supposedly remembering a time the former Tottenham striker went “10 games” without scoring. Since 2015-16, his first full season as a first-choice striker, Kane’s longest drought is six games but, besides, Kane played for Tottenham, not for a side that has just spent £400m on forwards. The criticism Kane has received most frequently is for dropping deep too often; nobody ever doubted his work-rate.Nobody comes out of this well. It’s not the first time Slot’s man-management has been questioned. Salah’s response, his insistence on blaming others, feels entitled. But the club must be questioned as well. The summer signings appear to have been designed for a post-Salah world, but if that is true, why offer him the new contract? For a club that has recently prided itself on its use of data, it feels a strangely sentimental decision.Perhaps releasing Salah, especially on a free, would have been too much disruption this past summer. There is already a sense that Liverpool have tried to change too much too quickly. And why did they end up with three key players reaching the end of their deals simultaneously? But keeping Salah while preparing for a future without him has led only to bitterness and recrimination.This is an extract from Soccer with Jonathan Wilson, a weekly look from the Guardian US at the game in Europe and beyond.Subscribe for free here.Have a question for Jonathan?

StarringRussell Tovey, Gugu Mbatha-Raw and Jemma Redgrave, it features a radical overhaul of a Doctor Who monster first seen in Jon Pertwee’s era: the Sea Devils.The drama plays as an ecological thriller, with humanity’s mistreatment of the oceans used as a stick by the Sea Devils – now dubbedHomo aquaandHomo amphibia– to justify their demands. Tovey’s “everyman” character is thrust into the global spotlight as humanity’s representative in negotiations that feel increasingly impossible.It isn’t only the ecological messaging being hammered home. As the Earth’s intelligent aquatic species insist on a peace deal that would prevent humans travelling across or above the seas, the parallels with real-world negotiations in which one side is forced into untenable conditions are clear enough.View image in fullscreenHammering home the message … Russell Tovey in The War Between the Land and the Sea.Photograph: BBC Studios/Bad Wolf/James PardonSome of the omens had not been good. The War Between has been described in some quarters as a spin-off nobody wanted, and the acronym of its unwieldy title – TWBTLATS – has already been renamed TWATBLAST on fan forums. Critical reaction has been mixed.On the plus side, Louise Griffinwrote for the Radio Timesthat “the writing is much sharper than recent Doctor Who” and that, despite “clumsy moments”, it is “emotive, funny … [and] benefits from the type of character development we all loved about Russell T Davies’s first Doctor Who era”. Rebecca Nicholsonin the FTsaid the series “looks set to swim off into pleasantly odd waters”, whilein the iIsobel Lewis described it as “the most grounded, mature storytelling that Doctor Who has seen in years.”The War Between the Land and the Sea review – prepare to roll your eyes a lot at this fishy Doctor Who spinoffRead moreThe Guardian’s Lucy Mangan was less enamoured inher three-star review, criticising Davies’s approach to writing female characters, and lamenting “an opportunity wasted” to make “something along the lines of his brilliantYears and Yearsfor a younger demographic”. Christopher Stevensin the Daily Mailwas predictably scathing – labelling it “woke, repetitive and stultifyingly dull”.The big question hanging over the premise is whether you can make a Doctor Who show in 2025 that doesn’t feature the Doctor. One advantage is that without the Time Lord, the stakes feel higher. When nearly all the regular cast were turned to dust in2024’s season finale, it was immediately obvious there would be a magical timey-wimey reset. That option isn’t here – and it would not be surprising if several major characters don’t get out alive.The five episodes form the final tranche of the BBC’s deal with Disney for Doctor Who,which has not been renewed. Disney+ holds the international streaming rights to this drama, and controversially has opted not to release it at the same time as the BBC, enraging international fans who now face months of trying to avoid spoilers.This isn’t the BBC’s first attempt to stretch the franchise. In 1981, companion Sarah Jane Smith and loyal robot dog K9 fronted K-9 and Company, chiefly remembered for itsexuberant opening titles. Much greater success for Elisabeth Sladen’s character followed with The Sarah Jane Adventures (2007–11), which delivered strong stories and included memorable turns by Bradley Walsh, Jane Asher, Samantha Bond and Russ Abbot as villains.View image in fullscreenIanto’s Shrine in Cardiff, October 2025.Photograph: Martin Belam/The GuardianAnother spin-off, Torchwood (2006-11), left a mark on the landscape; Cardiff still houses a shrine to Ianto (played by Gareth David-Lloyd), who died onscreen more than 15 years ago. Its tone veered wildly at first, but the third series,Children of Earth, was a critical high point, featuring future Doctor Peter Capaldi in a bleak story about aliens abducting children. A fourth run, co-produced by the American cable network Starz, proved the end of that strand.Class, a Patrick Ness-penned YA drama set in Coal Hill school, lasted only one season. The Whoniverse has also included various animated web episodes, and the BBC is now exploring a CBeebies-targetedDoctor Whocartoon.Meanwhile, the main show remains in limbo.Billie Piper briefly appeared to be the Doctorat the end of Ncuti Gatwa’s final episode, but viewers must wait until Christmas 2026 to find out what this means. It also isn’t clear whether Russell T Davies and Bad Wolf – who have produced the show since the 60th anniversary special,The Star Beast– will be involved after that one-off.Whether The War Between the Land and the Sea ends up remembered as another Children of Earth – a bold, surprising expansion – or as a well-meaning misstep like Class will depend on how the next three episodes land. It already has more riding on it than most spin-offs: currently there is no Doctor, no clear path for the main show, a frustrated international audience and a fandom keen for something to believe in. The programme’s own fate feels just as precarious as the prospect for peace between land and sea at the end of episode two.Explore more on these topicsDoctor WhoFantasy TVTelevisionTorchwoodRussell T DaviesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

These include a visit to the UN general assembly, the climate change conference in Brazil, and numerous Arab summits.In the latest sign of the goodwill directed towards Syria’s rebirth, envoys from all 15 members of the UN security council were in Damascus last week tomark the anniversary of the fall of Bashar al-Assad. The display of unity was a remarkable moment: since 2011 no issue has divided the security council more bitterly than Syria.The visit was also an acknowledgment of the role Syria and its diaspora can play in bringing stability to the Middle East.But ultimately the test will be whether Sharaa is able to translate this curiosity and goodwill into something tangible for the Syrian people in terms of lifted sanctions, internal stability and freedom from external meddling, whether by Israel, Iran or Sharaa’s potential ideological partnerTurkey.On the investment front, overseas pledges are rolling in. Saudi Arabia has promised investments worth more than $6bn (£4.5bn). Qatar is helping to revive the oil and gas industry and the final set of US sanctions is likely to be lifted in a vote before Christmas. But such is the chaos, Syria’s central bank admits it does not know the country’s true GDP.The influx of Gulf investment is dependent on Sharaa continuing on a path of internal reconciliation and trust-building, far removed from the extremist threat. At the same time he has to show his still-reeling country is not being used as a base from which either Islamists in the south can threatenIsraelor from which Kurds in the north will threaten Turkey.In this task he has gained the unlikely support of Donald Trump, who has promised to visit Damascus soon. Sharaa has already met Trump three times, including a critical meeting in November in the White House, becoming the first Syrian president to visit the Oval Office since 1948.View image in fullscreenDonald Trump shaking hands with Sharaa at the White House in Washington on 10 November.Photograph: HOGP/AP“He comes from a very tough place, and he’s a tough guy. I like him,” Trump gushed when they met.With his usual stream of consciousness, Trump continued: “We’ll do everything we can to make Syria successful, because that’s part of the Middle East. We have peace now in the Middle East – the first time that anyone can remember that ever happening.”Trump also obligingly brushed aside Sharaa’s controversial history. “We’ve all had rough pasts,” he said, as if property contract disputes in New York were on a par with Sharaa’s military turf war in Raqqa with the leader of Islamic State (Isis), Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, in which Sharaa lost 1,200 fighters.Perhaps the most striking of Sharaa’s many meetings was on stage in New York in September when he was interviewed by Gen David Petraeus, the former CIA director and retired army generalwho commanded US forces in Iraq while Sharaa was imprisoned there with other members of al-Qaida. Petraeus showed concern for the Syrian leader’s personal wellbeing, asking whether he was getting enough sleep. He added his former prisoner had “many fans” and that he was one of them. Sharaa said with a smile when asked about their shared past: “At a time, we were in combat and now we move to discourse.”“We cannot judge the past based on the rules of today and cannot judge today based on the rules of the past,” the Syrian president said.View image in fullscreenDavid Petraeus, a former director of the CIA and ex-US military general, with Sharaa during the Concordia Annual Summit in New York, in September.Photograph: HOGP/APThat willingness to reject the rules of the past is reflected in the remarkable joint intelligence operations Syria’s interior ministry conducted alongside the US last month, locating 15 Isis weapons caches in southern Syria.The concern is that external pressures are hampering Sharaa in his daunting task of keeping the country unified. In the south, Israel remains convinced Islamists are preparing terrorist attacks, while in the north, Turkey is impatient to see the strong Kurdish Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) either disarmed or fully integrated into the Syrian army.In both instances the White House is urging the external actors to be patient. In the case of Israel the fear in Damascus is it is intent on weakening Syria to the point it fragments, with a Druze-dominated rump state in the south.In total Syria has been hit by nearly 1,000 Israeli airstrikes, including on the capital, and faced more than 600 ground incursions.View image in fullscreenSmoke billows after Israeli strikes near the Syrian army and defence ministry headquarters in Damascus.Photograph: AFP/Getty ImagesSyria has been in no military position to do anything other than protest. There are now signs that Trump is losing patience with what he regards as a counterproductive land grab that prevents Syria from restoring its sovereignty.The US president warned Israel not to overstep the mark, saying on Truth Social: “It is very important that Israel maintain a strong and true dialogue with Syria, and that nothing takes place that will interfere with Syria’s evolution into a prosperous state.”Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, sensing Trump’s displeasure, said a security agreement with Syria was possible so long as Sharaa established a demilitarised buffer zone stretching from Damascus to Mount Hermon. But Trump may argue that by weakening Sharaa, Israel is only fuelling the instability in which extremism thrives.In Syria’s north, Sharaa’s efforts to integrate the Syrian Kurd fighters mainly in the SDF into a Syrian national army, once due to be completed by December, have stalled. For years Turkish policy has been driven by animosity toward the mainly Kurdish SDF, which it equates with the Kurdistan Workers’ party (PKK), a group that it sees as a terrorist group operating inside Turkey.The SDF claims to have about 70,000 men and women in its ranks and has received years of US training as part of the American-led coalition’s ongoing efforts to stamp out all remnants of Isis. It controls 25% of Syria’s territory. The SDF fears that disarmament could leave its fighters vulnerable to attacks from Islamist groups aligned with Sharaa.The SDF agreed in March to integrate with the Syrian military but only so long as its forces enjoyed a degree of autonomy.But since then Turkey has intensified talks about a possible peace deal with the PKK’s leader, Abdullah Öcalan, imprisoned on İmralı IslandIn a recent interview with Al-Monitor, the Syrian Kurdish leader Aldar Khalil argued the solution to the issue of SDF integration lay inside Turkey. Khalil said: “With every step that Turkey takes to resolve the Kurdish issue inside Turkey, our potential to become allies can only grow. Moreover, if there is a solution to the Kurdish problem in Turkey, then Turkey’s efforts to prevent Sharaa from granting the Kurds their rights will cease as well. I believe what happens in Turkey will determine what happens here.”What is clear is that after being a playground for external actors ranging from Russia and the US to Iran and Turkey, Syria still faces a perilous path back to sovereignty.Explore more on these topicsSyriaFall of Assad: one year onMiddle East and north AfricaUS foreign policyIsraelTurkeyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

During the meeting, leaders “underscored the need for a just and lasting peace in Ukraine” including “robust security guarantees” against further Russian aggression, Downing Street said.The leaders agreed that “now is a critical moment” for Ukraine and vowed to ramp up support for Kyiv and increase economic pressure on Moscow “to bring an end to this barbaric war”.The European show of support came after sharp criticism from President Trump, who said he was “a little disappointed” in Zelenskyy, claiming he had not read the US proposal for a peace deal. He insisted without evidence that “his [Ukrainian] people love it” and that Russia’s president,Vladimir Putin, was “fine with it”.The discussions follow US efforts to push through a peace deal that has triggered widespread concerns because it is seen by many critics as favouring positions held byRussia.Downing Street is hoping for a breakthrough on a deal to seize billions in Russian state assets held by European banks and funnel it to Ukraine.No 10 said the talks on Monday had yielded “positive progress” in the lengthy effort to use “immobilised Russian sovereign assets to support Ukraine’s reconstruction”. More than £180bn of Russian assets has been frozen in European banks and financial institutions since Putin launched his full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.EU leaders will meet on 18 and 19 December in an attempt to sign off on a long-awaited European Commission proposal to funnel £78bn of the frozen assets into a “reparations loan” that would go to Kyiv next year.The unprecedented proposal hinges on the idea that Moscow would eventually pay Kyiv reparations for the colossal damage caused by the fighting. Kyiv would use the reparations from Moscow to repay the loan to the EU, ensuring that the financial institutions holding the assets would get the money back.Though a majority of EU countries support the plan, it has met strong resistance from Belgium. About £160bn of Russian assets are immobilised at Euroclear, a central securities depository in Brussels, and the Belgian government is concerned that it will bear liability for any seizure and face retaliation from Moscow.The UK is prepared to hand over £8bn of assets frozen in Britain to support Ukraine but wants to do so in conjunction with other European countries.Starmer is set to discuss the issue on Friday with his Belgian counterpart Bart De Wever, who has come under pressure from other EU leaders. A spokesperson for the Belgian prime minister said he would be meeting Starmer in Downing Street to discuss “priorities like migration, supporting Ukraine, European security and mutual economic growth”.The meeting will come a week after Merz flew to Brussels in an effort to persuade De Wever to drop his opposition to the reparations loan plan.British, French, German and Ukrainian national security advisers have been instructed to continue discussions on the US-proposed peace plan this week.Zelenskyy, who has warned that his country “can’t manage” without European and American support, said the talks had been productive and had made a “small progress towards peace”. He said that Ukraine-Europe plans for a peace deal should be ready by tomorrow to share with the US.US officials claim they are in the final stage of reaching an agreement but there is little sign that either Ukraine or Russia is willing to sign the existing framework deal drawn up by Trump’s negotiating team.Among the sticking points is a Russian demand that Ukraine give up large swathes of territory in exchange for peace but Zelenskyy said last night that Kyiv had no legal or moral right to do this.“Russia is insisting that we give up territories, but we don’t want to cede anything,” Zelenskyy said at a press conference.“There are difficult problems concerning the territories and so far there has been no compromise.”The foreign secretary, Yvette Cooper, was due to meet her US counterpart, Marco Rubio, for further discussions on Monday, with the Foreign Office saying the two sides would “reaffirm their commitment to reaching a peace deal in Ukraine”.The talks follow the publication of aUS national security strategy, which spells out the Trump administration’s core foreign policy interests.The document released on Friday by the White House said the US wanted to improve its relationship with Russia after years of Moscow being treated as a global pariah and that ending the war was a core US interest to “re-establish strategic stability with Russia”.Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin’s spokesperson, said the document was largely in line with Moscow’s vision. The strategy paper also said Nato must not be “a perpetually expanding alliance” and suggested European states faced the “prospect of civilisational erasure” because of migration.Explore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaVolodymyr ZelenskyyVladimir PutinFriedrich MerzEmmanuel MacronDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

Farage has told reporters that he has never been racist or antisemitic with “malice”.Reform has strongly denied breaking the law on election spending, and called Everett a “disgruntled former councillor” who was expelled from the party several months ago.But Labour and the Conservatives said Farage had questions to answer over the allegations.According to theDaily Telegraph, Everett has claimed Reform failed to declare spending on leaflets, banners, utility bills and the refurbishment of a bar in its Clacton campaign office. The paper said he had submitted documents to the Metropolitan police with the allegations.He alleges that the party reported it came just £400 under the spending limit set by electoral law, and the undeclared spending would have put it above the cap. But he also said he thought Farage himself had been “blissfully unaware”.The Labour chair, Anna Turley, said: “Nigel Farage needs to reassure the public that he and his party will cooperate fully with the police and put all the evidence they need on the table.“Electoral fraud is a very serious crime which fundamentally undermines our democracy. All parliamentarians, including party leaders, must play by the rules so all candidates have a fair hearing with the public.“Nigel Farage needs to break his silence on this issue and demonstrate that he andReform UKhave followed the law at all times. Failure to do so will raise even more questions about what he has to hide.”The Conservative chair, Kevin Hollinrake, called on the police and the Electoral Commission to investigate Everett’s claims. “We all have an obligation to play by the rules to ensure that our elections are free and fair.”Everett, who defected from the Conservatives to Reform last year, has since left the party and now sits as an independent councillor.A Reform spokesperson said: “These inaccurate claims come from a disgruntled former councillor. The party denies breaking electoral law. We look forward to clearing our name.”It was reported that Everett first made his complaint to the Metropolitan police. On Monday, the force said: “The Met received an online report on Friday 5 December relating to alleged misreported expenditure by a candidate in connection with the 2024 general election.”Later the same day, Essex police said: “We are assessing a report relating to alleged misreported expenditure by a political party in connection with the 2024 general election, following a referral to us by the Met police.”While neither police force named a party or a candidate, the Met said the transfer to the Essex force had come about “due to the location of the alleged offences”.Explore more on these topicsReform UKNigel FarageEssexGeneral election 2024EnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

The details were set out in a public document at the high court in London.A source close to Bloom has said he intends to file a defence to the high court claim in due course.He did not respond to questions from the Guardian about the claim. On Friday,the Guardian published a second storythat focused on allegations Bloom could be an anonymous gambler behind $70m (£52m) in winnings – which allegedly included bets on his football teams.Bloom declined to comment about this specific claim, but through a source made clear he denied betting on his own teams or competitions that involve them, describing any such allegations as “entirely false”. He has since issued a public statement saying he had not bet on Brighton or any competition they are involved in since becoming its owner.Anna Sabine, the Liberal Democrat culture spokesperson, said the ban “completely flies in the face” of press freedom.“It is totally unacceptable that Brighton & Hove Albion FC ban specific outlets for simply reporting on allegations that are in the public interest,” she said. “This sets a dangerous precedent and the club should apologise and rethink this misguided decision.”Owen Meredith, the chief executive of the News Media Association, said the ban represented “a deeply troubling attack on press freedom”.“Football clubs and their owners occupy a prominent place in public life, and with that profile comes responsibility – including the responsibility to respect independent journalism,” he said.“Journalism exists to ask difficult questions on behalf of the public, including sports fans, and shutting reporters out sets a dangerous precedent for the game and for democratic accountability. If football clubs pick and choose who gets to scrutinise them, we are not in a world of sport, but censorship.”The News Media Coalition, which champions media reporting at organised news events including football matches, urged Brighton to swiftly reconsider. “Banning sports and news reporters, photographers and video journalists from attending football matches serves nobody,” said Andrew Moger, its chief executive.A Brighton spokesperson said: “It is not a decision we took lightly, and gave the Guardian more than 24 hours to remove or add some balance to the offending story. Instead, the Guardian doubled down.“We completely refute the claim we are restricting press freedom by not permitting access to our stadium press facilities or training ground. The Guardian will continue to report as it wishes.“We don’t however have to entertain its staff with media passes and hospitality at our stadium or press conferences while it continues to publish articles that are misleading and contain inaccuracies regarding our club’s owner.”Explore more on these topicsBrighton & Hove AlbionThe GuardianNational newspapersPress freedomnewsShareReuse this content"

Every time I go out I don’t feel safe. So much so that I’ve started to avoid it all together. This has also impacted my education and school life at the worst possible time.”A statement read on behalf of the victim’s mother said: “We have watched our vibrant happy and confident [daughter] shrink down and suffer with anxiety so bad that she’s often physically sick. This has affected every aspect of [my daughter’s] life and anything that hurts one of us, hurts us all in our family.”The boys pleaded guilty to rape at an earlier hearing.The court sentenced Jahanzeb, who has been served with deportation papers due to his age at the time of his guilty plea, to a youth detention term of 10 years and eight months.Niazal was sentenced to nine years and 10 months. As he was 16 at the time of the guilty plea, the judge invited the government to recommend deportation.The pair will start their sentences at a young offender institution and move to prison at a later date. They were also made to sign the sex offender register for life and given an indefinite restraining order.The judge lifted reporting restrictions protecting the identities of the defendants, who she said had “betrayed” those who come to Britain seeking sanctuary and observe the laws of this country.“A lack of information stokes public anger and leads to the unchecked spread of false information,” the judge said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The fourth victim, a woman, died on Monday, a day after being revived at the scene and airlifted to a hospital.Two of the victims were Romanian and two were Slovaks, their respective governments said. No further information about the identities of the victims was provided.Three dead and 15 hurt after rough seas pull people into the ocean in TenerifeRead moreThe pool at Isla Cangrejo, on Tenerife’s Los Gigantes coast, is very popular with foreign tourists, according to local media. Bordered by volcanic rock on one side and walled off from the sea on the other, the pool sits at nearly sea level and can be very dangerous during rough seas when large waves can easily overcome the cement barrier.Local media reported that a weather advisory for rough seas was in effect at the time when the swimmers were swept out to sea. One media outlet reported that the pool had been closed to swimmers since 3 December.Residents said swimmers had ignored signs and fencing put up to prevent anyone from going into the pool because of the weather conditions. They said it’s very difficult for anyone dragged out to sea to get a foothold on slippery rocks just below the pool.“People ... don’t know how the sea is here, and the danger of the pool, because there are rocks below on which people fall and can’t get back up. It’s very dangerous,” said one resident who didn’t give his name.Emilio Navarro, the mayor of Santiago Del Tiede, offered his condolences to the families of the dead and said rescue crews continued on Monday to search for the missing swimmer.He said authorities take steps to warn bathers of the dangers and to dissuade them from using the pool during rough seas. “We ... ask people to pay attention to the signage put up by the authorities,” he said. “It’s to take care of and protect everyone.”In November,strong waves killed three peopleand injured 15 in Tenerife by pulling them into the Atlantic Ocean during a tidal surge.Explore more on these topicsSpainEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

I think someone had my arms, someone my feet. I heard a crack and my head hit the pavement. The next thing I remember was being in an ambulance and a paramedic asking me questions. It was such a shock. Everything was quite blurry. It felt like an assault.”Cornwall council said the trees in Trelawney Road needed to be removedbecause they were causing damage to the road, pavement and nearby property.But Newman, a member of the Stop the Chop protest group in Falmouth, said there had not been enough consultation. She added: “We’re worried this shows there’s little protection for street trees. This could happen all over the country.”She said she had known the trees all her life. “They are very much part of the community. They are great trees,” she said. “I wanted to bear witness to what was happening. I didn’t want any trouble.”Wendy Wilbraham, a 72-year-old potter, said she felt the police presence was disproportionate and criticised the way Newman was treated.Devon andCornwallpolice said about 40 people were involved in the “demonstration”.A spokesperson said: “Officers attended in order to enable peaceful protest and facilitate lawful activity from Cornwall council.“One protester was subject to a use of force from officers after allegedly trying to access a secured area despite warnings not to do so. During this incident, the protester fell to the floor and suffered a bump to the head. She was checked over at the scene by the ambulance service and did not require further treatment.“A complaint has been made in relation to this which will be investigated in due course. No arrests were made.”Cornwall council said: “We recognise that this has been an extremely sensitive issue and appreciate the strength of local feeling. Trees are only ever removed as a last resort. In this case, the trees were causing damage that constituted an actionable nuisance, leaving the council with no alternative but to act.“We are content that removal of the trees was both lawful and necessary. Four new trees will be planted in purpose-built tree pits at roughly the same location on Trelawney Road.“Security arrangements were put in place on the advice of Devon and Cornwall police to ensure the safety of everyone involved. This was a precautionary measure given the degree of local interest and previous protests.”Explore more on these topicsTrees and forestsProtestCornwallnewsShareReuse this content"

We could definitely look to the bus franchising bill and all of that wonderful stuff that’s coming out, but we need transport and education to be working together to do that.”Amanda Hopgood, chair of the children, young people and families committee at the Local Government Association, agreed: “It’s assisted travel to school, as opposed to home-to-school transport.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

So that has required work to show that actually that’s no longer beneficial for that young person.”Anna Bird, chief executive officer at Contact, a charity for families with disabled children, raised concerns about access to home-to-school transport for 16 to 19 year-olds, which is being cut by councils because it is discretionary.“We would want to make the point that there will be some children who will always need support to get to school, no matter how local, and that the system needs to provide for these children. There needs to be a fair system based on need, not age.”Sarah Hall, Labour MP for Warrington South, described what parents and carers of children with Send in her constituency had told her during a recent roundtable.“Parents feel they have to fight for support every step of the way,” she said. “They find it demoralising. They feel like parents’ voices need to be heard more. They feel like it’s a very complex system and information about entitlements are not always clear.

Designed in-house at the DfT, the logo is the GBR name in rail typeface accompanied by the double arrow symbol – what the DfT describes as a “nod to Britain’s proud railway heritage”, rather than a direct lift from British Rail.‘People had forgotten about it’: onboard the 7am Manchester-London train service saved from axeRead moreThe first actual trains to be repainted could arrive from next spring, but fans of pretend ones can see the brand on a Hornby model and a virtual version in the Train Sim World 6 game at London Bridge, and on displays at other leading stations around the country.The unveiling comes aslegislation aimed at reforming the railwayis debated in the House of Commons on Tuesday. The government hopes the bill will create a unified, accountablenationalised railwayafter decades of a fragmented private system.The transport secretary, Heidi Alexander, said: “The future of Britain’s railways begins today. I’m immensely proud to unveil the new look for Great British Railways as we deliver landmark legislation to nationalise our trains and reform the railway so it better serves passengers.“This isn’t just a paint job – it represents a new railway, casting off the frustrations of the past and focused entirely on delivering a proper public service for passengers.“With fares frozen, a bold new look and fundamental reforms becoming law, we are building a railway Britain can rely on and be proud of.”View image in fullscreenThe Department for Transport says the double arrow symbol is a ‘nod to Britain’s proud railway heritage’.Photograph: Department for TransportSeven of England’s former private train operatorsare already back in public hands, covering a third of all passenger journeys in Great Britain, with the rest due to renationalised by the end of 2027. The new GBR, to be headquartered in Derby, will bring track and train operations together, at arm’s length from the government, and a strengthened passenger watchdog will be set up to monitor service.The new brand design also features on the GBR ticketing app under development, which the government will roll out as a new one-stop shop for passengers to check on their journeys and to buy tickets for travel across the whole network, without any booking fees. The DfT said the GBR app would also simplify travel for disabled passengers, who will be able to book Passenger Assist services to board and disembark trains in the same app when buying tickets.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But with many on his own side fearing that he doesn’t have what it takes to turn things around, he may not have the chance.The jostling among those who may wish to replace him – or whose allies believe they’d do a better job – continues…Angela RaynerTiming is everything in politics. When Downing Streetunleashed an extraordinary bout of leadership speculationamid fears Starmer was vulnerable to a challenge after the budget, it was not Rayner they were worried about.Although his former deputy remains popular among Labour MPs, the unions and the membership, it was widely felt that she needed more time for the scandal around her unpaid stamp duty bill to fall away. With the aftermath of the May elections now looking like Starmer’s moment of greatest peril, however, Rayner has time to rebuild. By then, she could even be back in cabinet, with the prime ministersaying at the weekendhe was “really sad that we lost her”.Since she left office, Rayner has been mostly sticking topolicy interventions, but allies have been on manoeuvres behind the scenes and all the indications are that she sees her future role as more than just kingmaker. While allies deny Rayner has agreed – or would agree – any sort of pact with Wes Streeting, sources have suggested that if she did win the Labour crown, she might have to appoint a chancellor on the right of the party to assuage the markets.Wes StreetingIt is no surprise that figures close to the prime minister had the health secretary in their sights when they warned last month that a leadership challenge would be a huge error. Streeting has made little secret of his ambitions and – aware that his best chance might be when Rayner was out of the running – his allies accept that he had stepped up a gear, courting MPs and thinking about strategy. “It’s planning, though, not plotting,” one insisted, stressing that he had no desire to actually wield the metaphorical knife.Often dismissed as being too right wing to get past Labour members, Streeting has defied expectations in recent months on issues including Gaza and welfare cuts – and has implicitly criticised party leadership. The shift appears to have been noticed by the membership, with recent polls giving him a cabinet approval rating second only toEd Miliband. Party members told YouGov the ability to beat Nigel Farage was a more important quality than sharing their values.Shabana MahmoodWhen Starmer reshuffled his cabinet back in September, movingShabana Mahmoodto the Home Office was seen by some as a masterstroke. With immigration so high up the political agenda, appointing a minister on the right of the party with a reputation for taking on challenging issues was welcomed even by the right wing press.Mahmood’s allies suggest she is closer to the centre of political gravity in the UK than just about anybody else in the cabinet – leaning to the left on economic issues and to the right on social ones. She earned her reputation as a sharp political operator in opposition as Labour’s national campaign coordinator who, along with Morgan McSweeney, laid the groundwork for the subsequent election victory.But while she is supported by a strong team, and has some starry-eyed fans on the Labour backbenches, others are more sceptical. Her hardline reforms to the asylum and returns system saw her support plummet among party members. And while allies believe she could make her case for the leadership in any contest, friends say that Mahmood herself remained unconvinced the country was ready to be led by a Muslim woman, even if the party was.Ed MilibandEven though it’s more than a decade since he led Labour to general election defeat, Milifandom is still very much a thing, with Ed Miliband regularly topping cabinet approval ratings – often way ahead of his colleagues. At the party’s annual conference in Liverpool, he was the darling of the fringe circuit.The energy secretary is one of the few ministers to be evangelical about his brief – leading the green energy transition and the fight against climate change. It means he has picked up enemies on the right along the way, but has shown his ability to bend the machinery of government to his will. Miliband even refused the prime minister’s attempts to move him in the reshuffle.Some of the former Labour leader’s allies say that he wouldn’t want the job again – he just thinks he could do a better job than Starmer. Others say he is frustrated not to get more of a hearing inside No 10 – especially as he has direct experience of leadership to share. They caution he would be reluctant to enter the fray when itcost him so much personallylast time. He’s more likely to be kingmaker than the next king.Best of the restThe defence secretary, John Healey, is talked about as a “safe pair of hands”, a solid performer and is popular across the Labour party, but is unlikely to excite the masses. Andy Burnham, however, regularly tops political popularity ratings with the public. But while the Greater Manchester mayor’s ambition is clear, his route back to Westminster looks difficult.Other Labour figures who could throw their hats in the ring in the event of a vacancy include Bridget Phillipson, the education secretary, Lucy Powell, the deputy leader, Darren Jones, the prime minister’s chief secretary, armed forces minister Al Carns, and leftwinger Richard Burgon.Explore more on these topicsPoliticsKeir StarmerLabourAngela RaynerShabana MahmoodWes StreetingEd MilibandexplainersShareReuse this content"

Days earlier, the council had served an eviction notice to those fighting to save the shelter, claiming their occupation was illegal.This marked the latest escalation following a week-long sit-in at the Sheringham bus shelter on Station Approach near the heritage railway station, afterNorfolkcounty council said it would demolish and replace the site due to accessibility and safety concerns.A campaign by local people has been calling for the preservation of their “beloved” bus shelter, arguing it is an important part of Sheringham’s heritage.Liz Withington, a councillor for the smaller North Norfolk district, was alerted to the arrival of bailiffs on Monday after receiving messages from campaigners at the shelter.“I was called and I got there within 10 minutes but initially there were three people sort of dozing and one was well asleep [when the officials] came in,” Withington said. “[They] came in and just told them that they’ve ‘got to get out’ and started being quite intimidatory.”A standoff between campaigners and the enforcement officials ensued, with protesters successfully manoeuvring past two security guards into the shelter, Withington said. The officials eventually left the vicinity, but spent the morning watching campaigners from their car across the street.“Enforcement officers [were] sitting very intimidatingly across the road from us, so we can’t leave the shelter or even go to the loo,” Withington said.The local Liberal Democrat MP, Steff Aquarone, expressed concerns that their behaviour was “intimidating” and alerted Norfolk constabulary. The force confirmed this was the case.The MP and about 20 campaigners have questioned the legality of the demolition and the eviction notice, arguing the shelter is owned by Sheringham town council. A meeting is due to take place to discuss the future of the shelter.“I think it’s totally inspiring and I stand shoulder to shoulder with them. This is about more than just a bus shelter,” Aquarone said. “This is about being heard and a local authority that has behaved in not just an arrogant way, but in a bullying way and they have lost the PR battle.”Protesters have been operating a rota system to ensure the shelter is always occupied. They began their sit-in on 1 December after spotting workmen arriving at the site.“[Campaigners] were about to have a meeting in the local pub to discuss what they were going to do when they realised the demolition team were arriving,” she said. “So they shot into the bus shelter and then started calling everybody.”Since then, Withington said the campaign had garnered a lot of support from locals, with several people bringing protesters food and drink.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And there are only, we believe, between four and six left in the country,” she said. “People have met at the bus shelter, people have sat waiting with grandmas and grandads for buses when they were little.”More than 3,000 people have now signedthe petition to stop the demolition. Withington said she believes the council have “disregarded” the views of residents, who are open to a compromise that improves the area but does not demolish the shelter.“The local voice is not being heard and not being listened to. [The council] wouldn’t come to the table and discuss it or consider any compromise. It’s [their] way or the highway,” she said.A spokesperson for the county council said the authority “stood bailiffs down at 10am” and that no work would take place on the bus shelter until after a town council meeting on Tuesday.The spokesperson added: “The land is owned by Sheringham town council but Norfolk county council currently have control and management of all parts of the site during the construction of the scheme, and our legal experts have advised that the eviction notice issued is entirely lawful.”Explore more on these topicsNorfolkLocal politicsEnglandLocal governmentfeaturesShareReuse this content"

This film asks a lot of questions about her contemptible inner circle – but fails to get to the bottom of the tragedyPhil HarrisonMon 8 Dec 2025 17.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 8 Dec 2025 17.02 ESTShareThe death of the Friends starMatthew Perrywas described as “sudden” on CBS News. In truth, it was decades in the making. Perry, by his own admission, was an alcoholic by the age of 14. Throughout his prodigiously successful acting career, he was engaged in a losing battle with various addictions. Sadly, finally, in 2023 his number came up after a struggle with another drug, one whose effects were right on the line between clinical and recreational. In his memoir, he had this to say about ketamine: “[It] has my name written all over it. They might as well have called it ‘Matty’.”Jasveen Sangha is an MBA student turned drug dealer from Essex who ended up in Hollywood, labelled the Ketamine Queen. Did she sell Perry the drugs that killed him? This documentary exploring the circumstances around Perry’s death is the work of Amber Haque, who, among other things, is the co-host of the true-crime podcast Bad People. She finds no shortage of truly terrible people here: personal assistants and doctors, dealers and quacks, lining Perry’s road to perdition, cheering him on and milking him for whatever dirty dollars they could extract along the way.And yet Haque never quite succeeds in connecting enough of the dots to make up the whole picture. It’s a pity because this is a story that should be told – if only to widely shame the truly contemptible likes of Dr Salvador Plasencia, who dangled grotesquely overpriced ketamine in front of a stricken Perry while texting a co-conspirator the question: “I wonder how much this moron will pay?” Plasencia has just been sentenced to 30 months in federal prison so, thankfully, was unavailable for interview here.The problem is, Haque never settles on a central thesis. You sense she’d like this documentary to be about any number of loosely linked but also very particular things. The troubled life of Perry, the barely regulated free-for-all that is the US healthcare system, the Hollywood party scene, the potential benefits and dangers of ketamine, and the inconsistently apportioned blame in this particular case are all jostling for space. It’s too much. Too many interesting threads are pulled then simply left dangling. It’s a series of slightly speculative questions waiting for answers.View image in fullscreen‘Never quite connects the dots’ … Amber Haque.Photograph: BBC Studios/Ben BryantIt’s possible that this might be a result of Haque’s work as a podcaster – given her magpie instinct to gather but not discard any strand of the saga, this may well have worked better as a story told in a series of bite-size chunks. Instead, there’s a disconnect between presenter and format that is filled by what sometimes feels like a checklist of modern documentary presentational cliches – Haque gazing into the middle distance while being driven through Hollywood; Haque exchanging pleasantries with an interviewee while the lighting is fixed.True-crime content is, of course, drawn to the inconclusive; it thrives on open-endedness. It is one of its strengths but it’s also a curse. But there’s no great mystery to uncover here in a legal sense. Everyone knows the basic facts of this case: Perry was an addict, numerous people leeched on to him and exploited that for personal gain, and eventually, it killed him.But there is a fascinating emotional narrative to be explored. The strongest parts of this film involve Haque attempting to piece together the motives of the people involved. The likes of Plasencia are basic and unenlightening, as naked greed generally is. But Sangha is a more complex and ambiguous figure. She comes from a wealthy family and presumably didn’t need the money. What was in it for her? Why become the Ketamine Queen?Haque – who is a persuasive interviewer – sits down with Tony, one of Sangha’s old drug buddies, to try to find out. Sangha was a user as well as a dealer (some members of her posse experimented with rhino tranquillisers), so this wasn’t simply business for her. “What she got addicted to was being in that role,” Tony says. “Being wanted by someone with that status.” Is drug dealing (like, in the wrong hands, any kind of medical career) a power trip? Is it a form of self-validation? Is creating circumstances where others are utterly dependent on you a guilty buzz in itself? These questions begin to form in the mind of the viewer but are never really addressed.And so, the two central figures in this sad story of human frailty remain elusive. As the film draws to its conclusion, Haque intones with great solemnity: “Jasveen Sangha is a drug dealer and she’s responsible for Matthew Perry’s death. But she isn’t the only one.” But we already knew that. That’s not documentary-making, that’s an elevator pitch. We need to know why. Why was Perry so prodigiously damaged? Why, for that matter, was Sangha? Why did they both need and destroy one another? One day, someone will make a film exploring these questions. This isn’t quite it.Matthew Perry and the Ketamine Queen aired on BBC Three and is on iPlayer nowExplore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV reviewMatthew PerryreviewsShareReuse this content"

I last watched Jamie Oliver cooking in Jamie Oliver’s Air Fryer Meals –a two-parter sponsored by Tefal– which was very bad.Now he is back, with Jamie’s Cook-Ahead Christmas. He shows us a potato and fennel gratin that can be served au naturel or – with a last-minute pastry envelope and a few carvings and pinchings that would see me pulverise the whole thing into a catastrophe, but which anyone who reaches the threshold of “minimally coordinated human” should totally do – as a beautiful ruched pie. You can make and freeze that now and reheat it on Christmas Day. I would fear for such a process with a mixture of potato, cream and pastry, but I am a culinary berk and Jamie is not, so listen to him not me.He takes care of your gravy needs (roast veg, rehydrate dried mushrooms, add rosemary, bay leaves, thyme, yeast extract, flour, blackcurrant jam, a stock cube and a couple of tablespoons of vinegar). He makes a stuffing that will allow you to fill the turkey and a jelly mould and bake the latter so the whole outside is crispy, therefore achieving stuffing nirvana. He whips up a variety of flavoured butters (freeze them in discs between greaseproof paper then you can just lay them over whatever dish you need to at the last moment), and an arctic roll for pudding that will – OBVS – sit happily in your freezer until needed.It’s a really thoughtfully put together selection. None of the recipes are complicated, even though the main priority is for them to be doable in advance. And almost all of them can accommodate easy variations to take guests’ personal tastes into account (the gravy, for example, branches into versions for vegetarians and vegans and for those needing gluten-free) and the pastry for the gratin pie can be anything from ready-rolled shop-bought to homemade, with grated walnuts for extra points.He’s full of helpful tips like rolling dough between greaseproof paper to prevent cracking, and arctic roll sponge while it’s still warm for the same reason, and dropping reminders in about which flavours go well together – squash and ground coriander, cumin and carrots, cranberries with your enemies. Not really. That last one is mine. I hate cranberries.View image in fullscreen‘A really thoughtfully put together selection’ … Jamie’s Cook-Ahead Christmas.Photograph: Chris TerryJamie Oliver – absent air fryers – is always good at content. It’s the form that some struggle with. The famous Jamie shtick, the high-octane bish-bash-boshing, “mega” most things, “epic” everything else, “cor!”, “amazing!”, “Lovely jubbly!”, great sighs and groans of inexpressible happiness at all points in between. I have, historically, been unable to cope with this. I am not made for joy and I find it impossible to believe in.But this time out, he seems calmer. There is still a scattering of “epics” and “happy days”, plus a “golden blipping perfection” but it’s all much less frenetic than it used to be. Perhaps Jamie is more confident. Perhaps, after a quarter of a century in the TV chef business he has become secure in the knowledge that his experience and expertise will carry him through, that viewers will stay with him even if he is not bouncing off the walls. Maybe he has intuited that we are living in less exuberant times than when we first met him in 1999 and has adjusted his style accordingly. Or maybe he’s just turned 50 and doesn’t have the energy any more.Whatever the reason, I suspect this new iteration will rebalance the fanbase. Those who always recoiled slightly from the original, wall-bouncing brand can look forward to gathering around this new, more welcoming host and starting to feel the fondness those who responded in their millions to the cheeky-chappy chef have always done. To the latter group, I can only offer my condolences and hope that either another new kid on the block turns up for you soon, or that the years catch up with you too and you begin to appreciate his elder statesman era.Jamie’s Cook-Ahead Christmas is on Channel 4.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewJamie OliverFoodreviewsShareReuse this content"

But that’s estate agent code for“tiny”.That’s because the home in question is not as big as you’d have thought. It’s a fairly ordinary-sized detached house in the Welsh countryside. Pencader, Carmarthenshire, to be precise.What’s the sell?Well, it has two bedrooms, although you could partition off the landing to create a third if you wanted. It costs £230,000 – £40,000 less than the average British home.It sounds like a good buy, but is it really Britain’s most desirable home?In a manner of speaking: more people viewed the listing than any other this year.And how do we know this?Because Zoopla has used all the data it has gathered to offer a snapshot of how we view homes.Wait, they’ve Spotify Wrapped the housing market now?Yes, but with Zoopla your children are less likely to hijack your account and skew the results.What did we learn from this report?For one, Zoopla estimates that there will be approximately 1.15m sales by the end of 2025, up 4.5% on the previous year.But hang on, people don’tjustflock to property listings because thehouses are desirable.No, I know. They flock to them because they’re horribly decorated, famous in some capacity (the most popular listing across Zoopla’s social media was a terrace home in Barry, which belonged to Doris from Gavin & Stacey) or the scene of a recent crime. But in this case, it really does seem that people just want to live somewhere affordable and rural.Boring!You’ll be pleased to know that the second most-viewed property this year was much more unusual. It was a six-bedroom villa next to Glasgow Prestwick airport, that came with 4.5 hectares (11 acres) of land and a floodlit football pitch, and cost £1.8m.Ah, unaffordable property searches, the nation’s favourite hobby.There are some crackers in the rest of the top 10, too. A £75,000 studio in Strathy Point lighthouse. A well-appointed character property near Troon for £220,000. A stately five-bedroom house within reach of Loch Lomond, £800,000.Why are so many of them Scottish?That’s easy. Scotland is a beautiful place to live. Lots of space, lots of fresh air.Anything else?I mean, it’s also a lot cheaper. The average price of a home in Scotland this year was £194,000, about £80,000 cheaper than a home in England.That’s huge.The disparity is even bigger if you live in Kensington and Chelsea, where the average home now sells for £1,071,600. It’s also worth mentioning that prescriptions are free in Scotland, and there aren’t any tuition fees there.Soeveryone shouldmove to Scotland?Yes, I’m sure all the Scottish people would love to be invaded by bargain hunters determined to gentrify the place beyond recognition.Do say:“The most desirable home in the UK costs £230,000.”Don’t say:“Let’s buy it and rent it out at an extortionate rate.”Explore more on these topicsHomesPass notesPropertyHouse pricesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

That sparked a chain reaction whereby we now have a more considered Christmas, choosing presents more wisely (or not at all) and cutting down on the excess. I’ve taken this experience – which has been truly rewarding – plus the advice of experts, to explore easy and joyful ways to be less wasteful this Christmas.How to reduce waste this ChristmasOpenconversationsView image in fullscreenBuying fewer gifts is one of the easiest ways to reduce festive waste.Photograph: SolStock/Getty ImagesTalk to friends and family before you start buying gifts. Try setting a budget, or limiting the number of gifts you buy per person, and take the time to ask people (or their nearest and dearest) what they want. If someone says they would prefer not to receive anything made from plastic, or bought from Amazon, or doesn’t want anything at all, respect their wishes. There’s always good oldSecret Santato consider as an option: get family members to write a short list of things they want, pick one name each anonymously, and everyone buys just one present.Invest in reusable crackersYou could try making your own with wrapping paper and cardboard tubes, but reusable fabric crackers are easier and make a statement on the table.

Replace plastic sticky tape with washi tape or brown paper tape, which is usually made from natural materials.View image in fullscreenChristmas robin kraft paper tape£6 at Holly & CoRelish your leftovers …Recipe developer, cook and food writer Elly Curshen’sRollover Leftovers series of Instagram videostackles kitchen waste, and she swears by the right storage. “I love glass containers for the fridge so I can see what’s inside – out of sight is out of mind, and that’s when leftovers get wasted.

They have a distinctly “green” flavour, and pair so well with lemon and olive oil. Trim the bases and pop a load down the chute of your food processor (fine-slicing blade attached) and you’ll have a big pile of shredded greens in seconds. They’re excellent value for money, and shredded sprouts can be added to slaws or kimchi recipes, too.”She also warns about buying too much cream. “It’s one of the most common ingredients I get asked for ways to use up after Christmas. I’d recommend buying smaller tubs and flavouring [it] yourself, rather than buying flavoured cream (however delicious they sound!). Leftover cream can be used in lots of ways, like making homemade butter, but a flavoured one makes that hard.”Choose linen for tableware and napkinsFestive paper napkins are convenient but single-use. Linen is among the most sustainable fabrics on the planet, since the flax it is made from grows easily without the need for irrigation or pesticides. Opt for vaguely festive shades, such as red or green in stripes or gingham, and you’ll be able to use them all year round.View image in fullscreenSet of four linen blend napkins£39 at Piglet in BedBuy things you genuinely love yourselfIf you love something and find it useful, the chances are someone else will.

No one replies to emails. My local party branch told meit can’t help.The portal requires me to open a new account and commit to another payment in order to cancel anything.I tried to block the payments from my Amex card but they managed to sneak a £5 payment again this month. My attempt to reclaim the money from my card issuer was rejected.I’m so frustrated that they are helping themselves to my account when they’ve been messing people about so much.My husband and I are of Asian heritage and have both noticed more outright racism this year. Your Party seemed like a beacon of hope for people like us, butit became a toxic joke overnight.Name and address withheld“A party that belongs to you,” proclaims the website of Your Party, set up by Jeremy Corbyn andZarah Sultana, along with four other independent MPs, to challenge what it claims is a rigged political system.Others havereported the same vain battleto cancel their subscriptions after months of public infighting among the founders. These are supporters who signed up when Sultanalaunched a membership portalin September with a different domain name to the party website and began collecting subscriptions.A company, MOU Operations, set up to oversee the creation of Your Party administered the funds. Corbyn declared the portal unauthorised, while Sultana claimed she had been forced to act to “safeguard grassroots involvement”. By then more than 20,000 had signed up. Corbyn and the other founding MPs launched a second membership portal a week later.It seems the two websites can’t communicate. Disillusioned subscribers can’t cancel via the new official portal, which has no access to their money or data, and can’t get a response from the old one. Moreover, they were obliged to sign up torecurring paymentsfrom their bank card that lack the consumer protections of thedirect debit guaranteeand are harder to cancel.In October, subscribers were instructed by email to contact MOU for refunds; MOU’s directors promptly resigned, declaring that the responsibility and liability for donations and members’ data was“thrust upon them” without their agreement. Sultana became the sole director responsible for the estimated £500,000 raised through her membership portal. She told me that all subscriptions through that portal have now been cancelled.“I am naturally sorry that your reader has had difficulty getting in touch, and assure them they will receive a full, immediate refund if they emailherewego@yourparty-membership.uk,” she said.A spokesperson for Your Party said: “The unauthorised portal has unfortunately caused serious issues for individual members and for Your Party. We had no knowledge of the portal and regret its publication. We know this has caused confusion and upset for many Your Party members and supporters, so, while refunds lie with MOU Operations Ltd, we have offered all those who signed up on Zarah’s portal three months’ free membership as an apology.”We welcome letters but cannot answer individually.

Here is what’s at stakeZoe WilliamsA mindblowing new show reveals the human cost when the political system turns against the people, putting stories and faces to the hundreds of thousands of citizens thought to have died due to austerityMon 8 Dec 2025 11.14 ESTLast modified on Mon 8 Dec 2025 13.17 ESTShareThe Museum of Austerity, which has just arrived in London having toured Manchester, Newcastle and Bristol, is such a simple idea: you put on a headset, and walk into an empty room. As you walk around, holograms appear; a man about to collapse, clinging to a wall with one hand; a woman leaning on a desk, such a plain image it could be any desk, but you know it’s a benefits office by her look of beseeching desperation; a man who has died in the street, his dog waiting for him to wake up. Approach any scene from the right angle, and the testimony of one of their relatives will start playing through the headsetIn 2022, a study in the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health estimated that there had been over330,000 excess deaths caused by austerity, one way or another, between 2012 and 2019. It was public knowledge and yet it was somehow too large to wrap your mind around: did it mean the coalition and then Conservative governments knowingly let people die? Or was it more a case of, modern life was different, and governments no longer took responsibility for whether or not people died? That seemed like a narrative everyone was more comfortable with, that these were straitened times, and the state no longer made health and life its core business. But how is that different to letting people die? And how is it comfortable?There’s none of that ambiguity about the handful of deaths in this installation: two women took their own lives, one overwhelmed by her disability assessment, the other sanctioned by the benefits office. Two men died at home, with no food in their cupboards. “Starved” sounds so melodramatic, but that’s definitely the right word, when you die from not having any food. One woman would have died anyway, having terminal lung cancer. The cruelty of her interactions with the DWP in the last weeks of her life is unimaginable, but she technically wouldn’t show up in the “excess deaths” statistics. Maybe it’s time for a separate study on the excess cruelty of austerity.A relative – two brothers, a mother, a daughter, a sister, a friend – tells each story very plainly. No one really likes using labels about people they love, so you don’t get much diagnosis, at least not of mentally ill people, yet you understand immediately why the person couldn’t have held down a job, couldn’t cope with the paperwork of trying to prove that, died trying. Themes repeat, across very different stories – the relatives keep saying that if their loved one had been tried in a court of law, at least they’d have known what the charge was; at least they’d have had a chance to defend themselves. So many say that it seemed as if the system was making a mistake, just hadn’t understood the condition of the person it was dealing with – the right call from a GP, a different assessor, a new form filled in and it would all clear up. The relatives ultimately realise that this isn’t a system error; brutality is the system.As you walk from one hologram to the next, you get audio of ministers using the cliches that are still so familiar, about a nation tightening its belt, making work pay, sloughing off the burden of sicknote culture. All this rough and clumsy but incredibly sturdy language around the proposition: we can no longer afford people not to be well. You still hear it, every day, whether it’s the chancellor weighing up a tax rise against a welfare bill reduction, or a health secretary “concerned” about overdiagnosis. There must be some way, they insist, to stop spending all this money on people who aren’t well. Surely with the right incentives, they will just get better? They never get to the end of that policymaking sentence, which is implicit in the state austerity has built: they’ll either get better or they’ll die. Let’s just suck it and see.It’s really short, this show – half an hour – and absolutely mind-blowing in its ability to connect what you already know to the guilt and sorrow that really knowing all that would call for. Over the road, they’re doing A Christmas Carol, where Dickens attempted the same thing, not as successfully in my view, but it’s definitely more suitable for children. You can’t build a society whose motto is “be well or die”. Nobody will thrive in it.Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Just the latest rightwing lie peddled by LabourFrances RyanStarmer’s ailing government is happy to pursue ideas like cutting Motability, but all ministers will do is damage lives and themselvesMon 8 Dec 2025 10.28 ESTLast modified on Mon 8 Dec 2025 14.54 ESTShareMonths before the government used the budget to launch plans totackle Motability– the scheme that leases subsidised vehicles with some disability benefits – a website started quietly spying on disabled drivers. Motability Check – run by an unknown third party and now offline – allowed members of the public to type in any number plate and (largely incorrectly) see if it was a car provided by the firm. The purpose appeared simple and disturbing: spot that neighbour who says they have a bad back and check with a few clicks if they are milking the taxpayer.From the spring, the idea that Motability was offering disabled people “free” BMWs and Mercedes began to spread. While the rightwing press suggested someone couldget a vehiclefor “bed wetting”and acne, blue tick accounts on Xgleefully arguedthe only car available to claimants should be cheap, ugly and “have MOTABILITY written on it, preferably in neon”. By October, the narrative had gone mainstream as the supposed scam of free cars was leapt on by theConservativesandReform UK.Fast forward to this winter and Labour has set out plans toend £300ma year of tax breaks and remove premium brands from the scheme. Rachel Reeves even mimicked rightwing memes with her language whenshe announced it: Motability “was set up to protect the most vulnerable, not to subsidise the lease on a Mercedes-Benz”. Meanwhile, Kemi Badenochsaid this weekthe Tories would ban conditions such as anxiety and ADHD outright from being eligible.If 2025 has been the year “welfare reform” reentered the lexicon of British politics, few events sum it up more than the assault on Motability, a policy that has been a lifeline for disabled people for almost 50 years with little fuss.This is partly a story about valid scrutiny of amultibillion-pound bodyhandling public money. Therehasbeen a large growth in Motability recently – with thecustomer base risingby about 200,000 in two years to 815,000 as the nation’s health has declined and disability benefit claims increased. Similarly, it is fair to questionhigh executive payand the company’sreportedlylarge cash reserves.How Motability cuts went from a rightwing online campaign to Rachel Reeves’s budgetRead moreBut it is far more a story about how a mix of misinformation, prejudice and insecurity has reignited an all-too-familiar fire: when living standards are stalling and public services failing, society turns on a minority said to be having it easy at taxpayer expense.From asylum seekers staying in hotels while locals struggle to pay the rent to benefit claimants driving a new car as workersmiss the bus, this year has seen a fixation on what certain – notably marginalised or disadvantaged – groups supposedly get.We are in an era that is in many ways defined by a sense the state no longer provides what the public needs: not just the NHS and schools but libraries, social care, parks and so much else. Add in the fact the squeezed middle isbeing taxed moreand millions of others continue to struggle for the basics, and the idea that there are disabled people getting luxury cars handed to them naturally fuels resentment. That’s only compounded when large sections of the media and political class propagate the now common idea that many of those in receipt of support are notreallydisabled (or for that matter, tax-paying workers).But is any of it actually true? I spoke to experts about the popular claim that the Motability scheme is easy to exploit. “Accessing Motability requires extensive applications, medical evidence, invasive examination, testing and proof of your impairment, and reapplication for support every few years,” said Sophia Kleanthous from Transport for All. “We support many disabled people who have been wrongly denied support, because they’ve struggled to prove that they meet this high bar.”What about the idea someone can get a car because of allegedly minor conditions, such as acne? “Government data shows there are just five people claiming enhanced mobility [of the gateway benefit, personal independence payments] for acne,” says James Taylor from Scope. “The stats don’t show co-conditions, so those people could have multiple other disabilities too.” That means the handful of people with acne who are eligible for a Motability car – but are not necessarily leasing one – could have, say, arthritis as well.The British Association of Dermatologists also confirmed to me that there are ways acne might impact mobility, including rare forms that cancause joint pain. GB Newspundits, funnily enough, aren’t medically qualified.That disabled people should not get a luxury car on the scheme might similarly sound reasonable at first. But take a look at the data and only6% of Motability’s fleetis made up of non-economy brands, while the cost to the taxpayer is exactly the same due to the fact disabled people already pay the extra fee themselves.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Disabled people do that too,” says Kleanthous. “We might need an adapted car with enough height to carry us in our wheelchair or a boot that self closes. Some accessibility features are only on higher-spec vehicles. But the biggest issue is choice. Motability allows us to have a car we need, but we should still be able to choose to pay more to have the car we want.”Look ahead to the new year and more of this is on the horizon, from the government’s plan for special educational needs and disabilities (Send) amid talk of parentsabusing the system, to Wes Streeting’s review of the supposed “over-diagnosis” of mental health issues in light of rising sickness benefit claims.Such ideas appear to be salvation to Keir Starmer’s ailing administration, but it may well find that these only add to its problems. Just as with immigration, capitulating to critics of Motability will never be enough. The goalposts always move: first the issue is said to be disabled people having luxury cars, then tax breaks, then any car at all.There is a way out of this: raising living standards, well-funded public services, and a spirited defence of the safety net and those who rely on it. It will also require an honest conversation about why we are collectively getting sicker and addressing the underlying causes rather than stubbornly assuming there is an epidemic of healthy people faking. That is not a quick fix, but it is the only one that will help heal an increasingly broken social fabric. Making it harder for a disabled person to leave the house is a dark and false solution to a genuine crisis.Frances Ryan is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsDisabilityOpinionBenefitsNewspapers & magazinesLabourAutomotive industryWelfareKeir StarmercommentShareReuse this content"

No Richard Linklater? This amazing director actually has two films in the “best musical or comedy” section (so I guess he can’t really be that depressed). There’s his amazingly witty and poignant chamber pieceBlue Moon, with Globe-nominated Ethan Hawke playing depressed Broadway lyricist Lorenz Hart, and his eerily accomplished pastiche-homageNouvelle Vague, about the making of Godard’s classic Breathless, shot not in the boring old colour in which these events happened but in a beautifully realised monochrome – a little reverential for my tastes but still a marvellously accomplished picture. Two films in one year, and such different films. Quite a feat.Blue Moon review – Ethan Hawke is terrific in Richard Linklater’s bitter Broadway breakup dramaRead moreElsewhere, Sydney Sweeney has been overlooked for herperformance as boxer Christy Martin– I’d have liked to see her nominated for playing the eponymous role in Paul Feig’s tongue-in-cheek, 90s-style erotic noir The Housemaid. Kathryn Bigelow’sA House of Dynamitewas great and unjustly overlooked. Nothing for Kelly Reichardt’s tremendous social-realist heist adventureThe Mastermind(and nothing for its star, Josh O’Connor). Bradley Cooper’s standup comedy movieIs This Thing On?isn’t all that it might have been – but I would have liked to see Will Arnett get a nomination. And what about Emma Thompson in the excellent suspense thrillerDead of Winter, a film that has utterly vanished from this year’s awards season campaigning. Did I dream it?View image in fullscreenDead in the water … Emma Thompson in Dead of Winter.Photograph: Vertigo/PAOf course, the frontrunner is Paul Thomas Anderson with nine Globe nominations for his colossal countercultural satire caperOne Battle After Another, inspired by Thomas Pynchon’s novel Vineland with Leonardo DiCaprio as Bob, the chaotically washed-up revolutionary and pothead who can’t remember his organisation’s secret telephone password, and Sean Penn as Lockjaw, the bullnecked military honcho dedicated to taking them down – but poignantly infatuated with Bob’s former partner, a charismatic badass played by Teyana Taylor. Lockjaw is in a symbolic paternity dispute with Bob over a teen played by Chase Infiniti – a battle for the soul of America’s youth.The pure energy and excitement of Anderson’s film-making has captured the Globes’ voting constituency and there is something interesting in putting it in the “musical or comedy” section. Perhaps that is what it is – a comedy. Josh Safdie’s delirious ping-pong adventureMarty Supremewith Timothée Chalamet might yet surge up alongside it, however.In the “best film – drama” list, my personal vote would be for Kleber Mendonça Filho’s stunning epicThe Secret Agentwith Wagner Moura as the scientist in 1970s Brazil on the run from the authorities (actually, a posthumous Globe supporting actor nomination for the lateUdo Kierwould have been nice).

But Ryan Coogler’s horror-thriller mashupSinnerswith Globe-nominated star Michael B Jordan has a huge and growing following with seven nominations and this movie might well pinch it on the night. And Guillermo del Toro’s romantic gothicFrankensteinis, to use a cynical term, testing well with the voters.Golden Globe nominations: One Battle After Another leads the chargeRead moreNon-English-language movies are well represented at the Globes this year, and Joachim Trier’s heartfeltSentimental Valuehas no fewer than eight nominations, with Renate Reinsve up for best female actor in a drama (though it could as well have been in the comedy category). She could well win – and it’s an interestingly unexpected inclusion for Eva Victor for their indie black comedySorry, Baby.As for the supporting turns, I think Emily Blunt might well get it for her very interesting performance in the otherwise moderateThe Smashing Machineand for best supporting actor my hunch is that Globe voters will be turned on by Jacob Elordi’s hunky monster in Frankenstein. (It’s a nice warmup for his Heathcliff in Emerald Fennell’sWuthering Heightslater in the new year.)But this looks set to be Paul Thomas Anderson’s night and if he can induce the awards-season groupthink to endorse the value of his film with a big win, then 2026 could well be his big year.Explore more on these topicsGolden GlobesAwards and prizesPaul Thomas AndersonEmma ThompsonRichard LinklaterSydney SweeneyKathryn BigelowcommentShareReuse this content"

Timed to ruin holidays like a round of end-of-year layoffs, the streaming giantannounced plansto buy Warner Bros, a movie and television studio with a full-century legacy. It’s possible that the acquisition won’t actually go through – and if it does, it won’t be for at least a year. But the news still looms over year-end awards and list-making, and it’s going to take more than a jingle-bell heist to steal back any holiday cheer for the entertainment industry, much less halt the march of corporate consolidation and monopolization. Even more depressing: the entity that seems most able to take action against this is … another attempted consolidation. Paramount haslaunched a bidfor a hostile takeover of Warner Bros Discovery, which would bring two big studios under one extremely Trump-friendly umbrella. This would almost certainly further cull the number of wide-release movies released each year.The end of big-screen cinema? What Netflix hopes to achieve by buying Warner Bros | Andrew PulverRead moreDepression might not seem like a rational response, especially for anyone who doesn’t actually work in said industry. (There are plenty of reasons that various unions aremaking their opposition to either sale known.) Yet the news last week had hundreds of film fans posting eulogies and defenses not just of Warner Bros as a studio – which on its own includes a vast history encompassing classics like Casablanca, The Adventures of Robin Hood, The Departed, Bonnie and Clyde, The Searchers and The Matrix, among hundreds – but the very fabric of theatrical moviegoing.It’s an institution that many of us took for granted for years. The venues might change, with single-screen palaces and drive-ins giving way to mall theaters and multiplexes, but it was easy to assume that movie theaters would always be around in some form or another. Now some habitual moviegoers, still shaken up by the extended closure of many theaters during the worst of the Covid-19 pandemic and a Netflix-led cultural shift toward watching everything on the couch, periodically enter a panic over whether theaters as we know them will still exist in 10 or 20 years.They probably will – at least in big cities, where a variety of mainstream new releases, arthouse runs and rep screenings sustain a healthy variety of exhibition options. (Manhattan alone has more than two-dozen theaters.) But beyond the many areas where a thriving movie house is not a given, it increasingly feels like the ability of movie theaters and studios to weather various storms may not actually matter in the face of such corporate flexes.View image in fullscreenMichael B Jordan in Sinners.Photograph: Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc./PAWhat’s dispiriting about the Netflix news is how clearly it indicates how little a studio’s actual success matters in terms of sustaining itself – because on those terms,Warner Broshad a spectacular year in 2025. They captured the youth audience with A Minecraft Movie, posted huge grosses for original and auteur-driven genre hybrids Sinners and Weapons, revitalized their superhero franchise with Superman, maintained two storied horror series with new Final Destination and Conjuring sequels, positioned One Battle After Another for a possible Oscar run (and gave Paul Thomas Anderson his most-seen movie yet), and even had a hand in an old-fashioned, near-literal star vehicle by distributing Apple’s F1 movie with Brad Pitt. And while previous years saw some costly flops, they’re only a few years out from Barbie becoming their biggest movie ever. Not to get corny about something that is, after all, another mega-corporation of its own, but between Barbie, Dune, Minecraft, Superman, One Battle After Another and various movies where King Kong fights Godzilla, chances are most casual moviegoers had at least one great time a Warner Bros movie sometime in the last couple of years.Warner Bros Disaster? Netflix inks deal for troubled Hollywood giantRead moreIn the hands of the Warner Bros Discovery CEO, David Zaslav, though, these hits aren’t evidence of how the movie business can flourish. They’re valued insofar as they can help goose the possibility of a sale. On the other side of that transaction, Netflix probably isn’t buying Warner Bros because they see a valuable library of older films and a ready-made pipeline to major theatrical releases. In a movie-centric utopia, Netflix could complement the Warner Bros slate with lower-budget romcoms, adult-driven thrillers and teen movies that big studios often ignore, as well as a regular supply of the streamer’s sideline in artistic passion projects from the likes of Martin Scorsese, Spike Lee, Noah Baumbach and David Fincher. (Maybe auteurs like Scorsese and Lee wouldn’t be scared off after a single movie, knowing that Warner Bros could actually put their films in theaters.) Netflix could also bring all manner of classic cinema into viewers’ homes.But judging by how many pre-1990 titles on Netflix at any given time and the awards-qualifying theatrical releases it begrudgingly gives its more prestigious projects, a rich catalog and major theatrical releases are elements of the film industry and its history that the company vaguely disdains. Netflix is buying Warner Bros mostly to eliminate the competition ofHBOMax – and maybe, down the road, the broader competition of people occasionally leaving their homes for entertainment.View image in fullscreenDaniel Radcliffe in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/AlamyOh, and the IP. Netflix subscribers received a so-sad-it’s-funny email from the company about the impending purchase, in which they crowed about “bringing some of the world’s most beloved franchises like Harry Potter, Friends, The Big Bang Theory, Casablanca, Game of Thrones and the DC Universe together with Stranger Things, Wednesday, Squid Game, Bridgerton and KPop Demon Hunters.” It’s telling that the token Warner movie that they algorithmed into this announcement is Casablanca, perhaps the most “name a movie” movie of all time (at least in the pre-1970 division), which they immediately, bafflingly, and terrifyingly describe as a “franchise”. (For that matter, how is Friends a franchise? That show has yielded one reunion special and a bunch of cheesy in-person pop-ups in the 20 years since it left the air.)On its own, this is just corporate insensitivity and bumbling – neither particularly endemic to 2025 in particular. And yes, the movie-lover’s grandstanding over the sanctity of the theatrical experience can feel a little embarrassing. Suddenly we’re all Nicole Kidman, reading from a series of quasi-PSAs on behalf of multiplexes that forget to turn the lights down and don’t employ projectionists who can fix technical issues. Divorced from that grandiosity, though, moviegoing can be a simple pleasure, a relatively affordable escape that some companies seem hellbent on treating like a productivity problem, begging to be solved. Wouldn’t you save energy by staying home? Wouldn’t you feel like you’re saving money if you agree to give us 20 bucks a month in perpetuity for whatever stuff we can scrounge up for our homepage? Doesn’t the decision to watch a particular movie take up valuable brainpower we could colonize with an algorithm? Even if Paramount doesn’t succeed in wresting Warner away from Netflix, a hostile takeover has already begun. Tech weirdos want control of our art and leisure. We shouldn’t cede it to them.Explore more on these topicsWarner BrosNetflixFilm industryUS televisionHBOTelevisionUS television industrycommentShareReuse this content"

But the new words still land as a shock. The security document is the clearest signal yet of how brutally and transactionally Washington wants to engage with the continent. It marks another phase in Trump’s attempt to reshape Europe in his ideological image while at the same time abandoning it militarily. US policy, the paper says, should enable Europe to “take primary responsibility for its own defence”.Withdrawing US troops from Europe has been a particularly adamant demand of the Maga right. Figures such as Steve Bannon openly argue for “hemispheric defence” – defending the Americas, not Europe. On hisWar Room podcast, Bannon said plainly that: “We’re a Pacific nation … the pivot, the strategic heartland of America, is actually the Pacific.”One of the clearest articulations of US strategic retrenchment has come from a key figure in Trump-era defence thinking:Elbridge Colby,the principal adviser on defence and foreign policy at the Pentagon. In a 2023 policy paper,Getting Strategic Deprioritization Right, Colby and his co-authors laid out the logic behind reducing US commitments in Europe and concentrating resources elsewhere.The starting premise is clear. As one contributor puts it, “the United States does not have, and does not plan to develop, the ability to fight and win major wars inEuropeand Asia simultaneously”. China, they argue, is the decisive theatre, not Europe, and US attention and assets must shift accordingly.Washington has signalled some version of this pivot for more than a decade. Yet European governments have found the idea that the US might actually deprioritise the continent’s security remarkably abstruse. The war inUkrainehas intensified this tension: Europe’s thinking is that a US withdrawal or an imposed, unequal peace would produce chaos in Ukraine and instability across Europe.For Colby this is not in itself a sufficient argument against the US leaving Europe. As he writes: “Instability or even chaos alone is not enough … to judge a deprioritisation effort a failure.” What matters, in his view, is whether the US finds ways to shield itself from the ensuing chaos.The new US security strategy confirms that Washington is increasingly focused on its “Western Hemisphere”. The administration plans to deprioritise issues and missions abroad – including, to some extent, China – to concentrate on domestic security and its immediate neighbourhood. The US naval buildup in the Caribbean, the largestin more than 30 years, underscores this shift.There are reasons to believe that the US will not abandon Europe completely. Protecting roughly$4tn in US investmentson the continent remains a key interest. Yet the direction is unmistakable – Washington is stepping back. The urgent question for Europe is, are we ready for the consequences?Because it is clear that as Washington draws back militarily, it will pull even harder on its other levers: financial power, diplomatic pressure, export controls, trade measures and secondary sanctions. These instruments will increasingly be used to steer Europe in the political direction the US wants. Lenient enforcement, or the scrapping of digital and green rules altogether will be demanded of the EU – as US commerce secretary Howard Lutnickdid last month.All this is happening as the security umbrella above Europe becomes ever thinner. The result is a dangerous asymmetry: less protection and more pressure.Europe risks becoming collateral damage in a prolonged US-China confrontation while no longer enjoying the iron-clad guarantees that once cushioned those shocks. That is a brutal, lose-lose position.If Europe wants to move from a defensive crouch to a posture of strategic agency, it must sustain its surge in defence investment and make it crystal clear that attempts at coercion from Washington or Beijing will be met with forceful countermeasures.Only then can Europe avoid being squeezed between a retreating patron and a mistrustful rival.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The US’s impulse to disengage from Europe is more powerful than anything an uneven trade concession can offer them.Europe must not repeat that mistake.

Only a firm response will register in Washington.If the US is to deprioritise Europe’s security, it has to come at a cost: its influence in the region should follow.

Our chance of salvaging something from the mess it created is being undermined by those selling false hope – either that Brexit can work, or that it can be easily undone. For the 16,000 businesses that havenow given up trading with Europebecause of paperwork, prospects remain bleak unless the government stops offering a sticking plaster and starts major surgery on our future with Europe.Forgive pro-Europeans for thinking the momentum is now with us. Labour has been slow to say what it wants from the EU reset, and slower still to acknowledge the inevitable tradeoffs required. Until the summer, ministers promised to “make Brexit work” and endlessly repeated “red lines”. Yet in recent weeks, a major study has found that leaving the EUcost the UK 6-8% of GDP per capita; now the chancellorcalls the damage of Brexit“severe and long lasting”; the prime minister condemns the “wild promises” of the Leave campaign. Belatedly, a window of opportunity to change course may be opening.History shows that simply saying we want something from Europe doesn’t make it happen. The UK can be its own worst enemy – acting as if the challenge is in usdeciding our objectivesand the easy part is Europe agreeing. For the 27 other nations that are also part of this relationship, Britain’s confidence about who sets the agenda – from supporters and opponents of Brexit alike – is baffling.Anyone pro-European should resist talk of rejoining – not because Brexit was a good idea, but because to rejoin is, right now, an impossibility. Having dealt with our drama following the 2016 vote, asking the EU to indulge another referendum is like asking your neighbour to trust your next house party won’t result in more insurance claims. Even if the EU agreed to a rejoin process, it would take several years to decide the terms. Any other improvements to how we trade would be put on ice. For businesses desperate for respite, pursuing rejoin now would condemn them to another decade of struggling with paperwork mountains, with no guarantee a better deal will be secured.Those claiming we could “just”rejoin the customs unionor single market are little better at reading the mood of our neighbours. There’s no denying either would reduce the regulatory obstacles that have seen our goods exports to the EUfall by a fifth. But a customs union is an option not just with known drawbacks, such as giving up independent trade deals, but also outcomes we can’t predict, such as the EU’s new asking price on currency issues and movement of people. Rejoining the single market would mean taking on the anti-freedom of movement brigade and, given Britain’s divergence from the EU since Brexit, would be more complicated than many are willing to acknowledge.None of this is a reason not to aim high. Those independent trade deals are dwarfed by the effects of leaving the single market: therecent dealwith India ispredicted to addjust 0.13% per year to GDP. Europe can be more flexible than is often claimed – the Swiss aren’t part of a customs union but face far fewer barriers. But no option comes without costs, and the UK needs to be explicit in explaining why they are worth it. A customs union alone should not become our goal simply because it is seen as the least politically painful.Europe is perfectly capable of putting games before gains, too. Talks over UK participation in the EU’s €150bn Security Action for Europe (Safe) fund stalled when the commissiondemanded an exorbitant entry feeto show Brexit doesn’t bring benefits. Similar attempts to squeeze the UK can already be seen in proposed terms for the promised deals on food and animals – thesanitary and phytosanitary(SPS) agreement andemissions trading. Any hasty demands that make it look as if the UK thinks it deserves special treatment are likely to be knocked back.1. Measure the impactSo how can Labour square this circle? First, the government should commission a Brexit impact analysis, chaired by external experts, similar to thestrategic defence review. Previous governments stuck to the fantasy that Brexit could work; this government spent too long being shy to say it isn’t. At the budget, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR)declined to providefurther evidence on the economic effects of Brexit. That means, astonishingly, we still have no uncontested figures on the biggest single factor affecting growth.An impact analysis would put to bed that debate and those who still preachBrexitbenefits. It could also provide data to judge all future options, from the existing deal, to sector-specific deals on market access to – yes, membership of the customs union and the single market.2. Put everything on the tableSecond, the government should approach next year’s negotiations with Europe clear that it is looking for a deal offering “more for more”, with everything up for discussion – not just because we want better trade but because, in a world shaped by Donald Trump, Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping, Britain and Europe need each other more than ever. Geopolitical turmoil and the rise of far-right populists means that everything each side cares about should be on the table if the return is to be worth it.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Financial contributions to EU budgets must not be taboo if they bring net gain for the UK. Regulatory alignment is what UK businesses enmeshed in global supply chains prefer. Forget red lines – the Trump administration’s anti-Europeannational security strategy, and its threatenedNato withdrawal, should mean red alert.3. Trust parliamentThird, parliament should be brought into the discussion. Our future with Europe is yet to be debated formally under this government at all, let alone the possibilities of a revised deal. Brexiters and the “just rejoin” camp hide behind this lack of scrutiny to make their fantasies seem plausible. The government should not be frightened to take on either side, using the evidence in the review to show the impact of Brexit and what a new deal would deliver. Labour must confront those blocking the tradeoffs that would help British businesses by saying now they will put a mandate for that new relationship in the next manifesto.Nearly two-thirds of the publicnow see Brexit as more of a failurethan a success. But the obvious reason to overhaul our offer to Europe is that sticking with our current plans is irresponsible. This government inherited a growth emergency that is putting brutal pressure on public services and on people’s lives. Others profess simple answers for electoral gain. The right answers on Europe are not easy, nor quick – but they do exist.

Solving that will help young people and their families tooMon 8 Dec 2025 08.10 ESTLast modified on Mon 8 Dec 2025 11.00 ESTShareTis the season to be jolly, unless you’re a teacher, in which case you are most likely a zombified wreck tenuously held together by caffeine and chocolate bars that aren’t evenmade of chocolateany more.In the popular imagination, teachers finish at 4pm and have “all those holidays”. Yet at this point in the year, most I know are barely functioning. Colds are battled for weeks on end as we stumble through brief lulls in the day as though dazed, unable to string thoughts together. The half terms are, yes, a perk, but they are also a necessary buffer against complete burnout.I am all too aware that teachers are taken as supreme moaners, forever griping about workloads while enjoying the sort of work-life balance other people envy. So I can only imagine the eye rolls and ocular strain brought on by recent pleas from the 4 Day Week Foundation that teachers in England and Walestrial a four-day week.It is true that when the holidays arrive, I am not engaged in the same desperate scramble to find childcare for my children, but the reality isn’t that we get to sit and twiddle our thumbs. According to the Trades Union Congress (TUC), two in five teachers work anextra 26 hours a weekfor free. It is the highest unpaid overtime of any UK profession. To make the numbers add up, that’s a pay packet £15,000 a year lighter than it should be. Or what Patrick Roach, the general secretary of the NASUWT teaching union, calls “daylight robbery”.I have worked as a teacher for nearly 20 years and, for the past few, I have worked a four-day week. My non-teaching day has given me space to think, plan, reset – the very activities we shunt to the margins despite knowing that focus and recovery are essential to productivity. The reduced teaching hours didn’t make an immediate difference, but over time working like this has become the only sustainable way for me to also be a mother, daughter, partner and functioning human being.It makes sense that a small shift like this would allow teaching to be more compatible with how we live today. The traditional teaching week remains tethered to a bygone era. Teachers no longer simply impart knowledge. We are “managers” of behaviour, provide pastoral support and safeguarding, and deal with special educational needs and disabilities (Send) administration. That is before mentioning the emotional labour of working with 30, often hormonal, young people all at once for hours a day. All this in the context of stripped services for young people and their families.No wonder, then, that in a 2023 study only59% of teachersexpected to remain in the profession over the following three years, down sharply from 74-77% before the pandemic. A pervading sense of regret permeates staffrooms.Longstanding problems with the state of teaching are reflected in poor levels of retention andrising ratesof staff sickness. Schools in England spent£1.25bn on supply teachersin 2022-23. If we continue to organise teachers’ working weeks the way we do, we’ll get the same results. It’s why the call for a four-day week in the profession isn’t acquiescing to needless complaining – it’s a necessary innovation.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Schools would open for five days, with teachers allocated one day each week as protected time to plan, mark and deal with the pastoral issues that each working day inevitably throws up. These tasks, impossible to complete adequately between 8am and 4pm, take chunks out of evenings and weekends. It is not about working less but working smarter, so teachers aren’t run ragged by endless tasks.At some point, the adults in the room must acknowledge the greater, and more expensive, risk is business as usual. Each year, thousands of teachers leave: 41,200 in England last year alone. The system is losing experience faster than it can replace it. We can’t continue to talk as though the status quo is the only and therefore best option. It is already failing and costing young people the stability they, their parents and teachers need.A four-day week is no magic bullet. It will not fix squeezed budgets or crumbling infrastructure. Young people will still be overwhelmed by an intensely packed, exams-driven curriculum. What it would do, however, is give exhausted staff room to breathe and plan so they can be better teachers. It is a bold idea that may just match the scale of the crisis.The real question is this: can we afford to continue as before?Lola Okolosie is an English teacher and writerExplore more on these topicsTeachers' workloadOpinionFour-day weekTeachingcommentShareReuse this content"

Better to adopt the precautionary principle with high-stakes scienceMon 8 Dec 2025 13.08 ESTLast modified on Mon 8 Dec 2025 14.51 ESTShareIt is fitting that this week’sUN environment talksare in Nairobi, with Africa shaping the global climate conversation. The continent’s diplomats are dealing with the vexed question of whether it is wise to try to cool the planet by dimming the sun’s rays. While not on the formal summit agenda, on the sidelines they arearguingthat it’s time to stop promoting solar geoengineering technology as a solution to global heating. It’s hard to disagree.African nations have acted because they don’t want their continent to become atest bedfor unproven schemes to spray particles into the high atmosphere to reflect sunlight away from Earth for a small, uncertain cooling gain. They point toenvironmental, ethical and geopolitical risks. That’s why the continent is pushing for a global “non-use” agreement that would rule out public funding, outdoor experiments, patenting and official promotion of these technologies.The reason for a moratorium is obvious: solar geoengineering doesn’t cut greenhouse-gas emissions. The potential side-effects include altered rainfall patterns and the consequential pressure on food systems. Then there is the risk of a sharp temperature spike if the interventions were ever halted – the so-calledtermination shock.African nations’ opposition was such that they forced the withdrawal of aSwiss-backedresolution on solar radiation modification at last year’s UN talks.Yet an industry is being built on the idea that someone can take charge of the global thermostat. AUS–Israeli firmis developing a spraying system for future “cooling services” to offer to governments. Other nations are pushing back. Mexicobannedsolar geoengineering experiments in 2023, after an unauthorised trial over its territory by a US startup.Academics have alreadywarnedthat the UK became the first “major government” to significantly fund solar radiation modification (SRM) through itsAdvanced Research and Invention Agency(Aria). It is now backing scientists to research “climate cooling’” hardware and small-scale field tests. Other scientists describe the move as naive, poorly governed and scientifically incapable of proving SRM safe. Ministers ought to pull back.Research programmes have politics. Hardware and careers get built. Risky tech acquires well-funded backers. The actions of the US, the world’s largest producer ofoilandgas, should be studied. The Trump administration has made “American energy dominance” the core of its economic strategy. Solar geoengineering offers a way to manage temperature risk without loosening the carbon economy’s grip. Controlling both the world’s energy supply and the global thermostat has obvious appeal to the White House – and its billionaire backers.African governments’callfor a non-use agreement for solar geoengineering – echoing the precedents oflandmine and chemical weapons bans– is a recognition that some technologies shift power so sharply that they create unmanageable risks. A line has to be drawn. The precautionary principle is used with other novel technologies. Why not here? The point is clearly that this power can’t be left to a few.Africa’s call should be taken seriously. None of this weakens climate policy. It would instead focus minds on measures that address the climate emergency: cutting fossil fuel use, investing in renewables – and paying foradaptationwhere damage is already baked in.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Unable to describe Britain’s position, hemanagedonly a hope of “lasting” peace. This reveals a British state that has been hollowed out, as well as the diminishing returns of a political order built for another age. For decades, UK leaders assumed that the US would underwrite Europe’s security; that, as Washington’s closest ally, Britain would punch above its weight; and that British institutions would stabilise order, if not justice, in turbulent times. That world has gone.Monday’s Downing Street summit with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and the German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, threw the dilemma that Sir Keir faces into sharp relief. Mr Macron could speak of thecardsin Europe’s hand; Germany’s leader could voicescepticismabout American proposals. Even Mr Zelenskyy, fighting for national survival, could pithily articulate why heneededboth Europe and the US. Each spoke from within a political system that, however imperfect, has begun adapting to a post-American world. Britain has not – and, under its present leadership, shows littleinclinationto even envision one.Britain’s shrinking strategic autonomy and civic purpose is the result of a financial system that underpins its economic imbalance. The country is led by a prime minister who speaks of a “moral mission” to transform Britain while embracing a hyper-cautious spending programme. His appeals to civic unionism assume a coherent political community with shared interests, but the old solidarities ofclassandregionhave frayed; Scotland,WalesandNorthern Irelandpull in divergent directions; and society has withered under decades of managerialism andmarketisation.Financialisationhas undermined the basis of a sovereign state: overvaluing sterling, gutting manufacturing and driving private debt as capital chases speculation overproduction. It is no surprise that Britainlacksthe industrial depth to arm Ukraine, the budgetary flexibility to shape European security and the diplomatic leverage to challenge a US administration bent on forcing a premature settlement. The prime minister’s deference reflects not only conviction but constraint.The British state tradition – dependent onelite stewardship rather than civic engagement– has reached the limits of its utility. It once enabled decisive action; today it produces managerial caution. Britain’s leaders have authority, but not the imagination to reinvent it. This is most evident in the dominance of the Treasury, which continues to define the limits of what is possible. After years of being unfairly targeted, the civil service has retreated to the sidelines. Political parties have become electoral machines rather than representing a wider collective purpose. From that perspective, Sir Keir’s stance is a feature, not a bug, of the system.Nostalgic appeals to “a special relationship” that no longer exists will not renew Britain. That demands a profound reimagining of the nation’s constitutional, economic and geopolitical identity. The prime minister’s response toUS manoeuvres over Ukrainereveals a leader trapped within a fading order. The tragedy is not just that he cannot meet the moment, but that neither can the British state. Until the country’s politics can move on from past glories, it will continue to produce leaders who mirror the state they inherit. Even if they are dutiful and conscientious, they will still be lost.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Such events that hurt children or young people, whether words or actions, are remembered for the whole of a lifetime. I remember a similarly unpleasant event that happened to me at the age of 13 on 14 February 1964. I could go to the exact spot. That was more than six decades ago, not four.Name and address suppliedI was sad, but not surprised, to read the letter from Kirsty Pierce (2 December) regarding her experiences of bullying at a convent school. My school was a Catholic grammar in the north-east and bullying from both staff and pupils was rife. In the 1970s, the advice was to ignore the bullies. This does not work. The perpetrators get away scot-free and the pain remains for ever.I could never understand how these people could be so devout at Sunday mass and so spiteful for the rest of the week.Pippa LewerSowerby Bridge, West YorkshireIt is true that appalling racism was commonplace in the 1970s, but it was also the era of Rock Against Racism and the Anti-Nazi League.

We knew that even if we’d paid our cheap mortgages off (lucky us), we would either have to downsize or have taken out our own pensions. We knew the state pension would never be enough.So we did. And if we were lucky, it covered the cracks. Except that when we retired, we were taxed again on our pensions, having already been taxed on the funds we used to take them out in the first place.My localNHShas a five- to eight-week waiting list to be told whether I am on its lists, but I will wait another four to eight weeks for the date of the appointment, which maybe a further eight weeks after that. If you have heart disease, which I have, you are grateful to be able to go private.We cannot afford an ageing population and an ageing ill population. I would happily pay the NHS to look after me. I would have liked to have had the option, when I had retired, of being able to pay for an updated NHS insurance stamp for my health.Our population is increasing and so are the numbers retiring. It would have been more helpful if the chancellor had addressed these huge issues rather than put together her piecemeal budget.Derek WyattLabour MP for Sittingbourne and Sheppey, 1997-2010John Harris evocatively described “uncertainty eating into lives”. My research shows that tens of millions of UK residents are facing insecurity in one or more important parts of their lives. In 2023,5.2 million UK adultswere financially insecure and also had insecure housing and insecure health. Rates of multiple insecurity are higher now than immediately after the global financial crisis. Peopleexperiencing multiple insecuritieshave double the average rate of sleep problems, strain and loneliness. Sustained insecurity doesn’t just mean millions of sleepless nights. Just as years of austerity have eroded the capacity of organisations, insecurity will erode people’s ability to plan, to trust, to care for one another and to empathise.Rebecca TunstallProfessor emerita of housing policy,University of YorkExplore more on these topicsLabourBudget 2025InequalityNHSTax and spendingBudgetPensionslettersShareReuse this content"

We all need better evidence, 4 December). Political point-scoring has no place in public health.By setting up this taskforce, Streeting acknowledges the complexity of the picture and that conversations must be led by research, where science and suffering can be held together.The increase in reported mental health problems and neurodevelopmental diagnoses, and services not keeping pace, reflect what many clinicians see every day – people are in more distress and unable to access support. The suffering is not fake, nor is it a case of gen Z malingering.Patients are struggling with what were once ordinary demands of life: school, work, relationships and family, complicated by the aftermath of Covid, with blurred boundaries between home and work, and life lived increasingly on screens. We still don’t understand the neurological impacts of Covid, but we can clearly see the social impact on children’s development and learning.In this context, ADHD or autism can become an explanatory framework for a complex constellation of neurobiological factors and psychosocial difficulties.A diagnosis can be clinically meaningful by reducing self-blame and shame that block people from seeking help, bringing those who might not otherwise attend services through the door, where professionals can identify differential diagnosis or address comorbidities.I hope this review will lead to a holistic understanding of neurodevelopmental diagnoses, and to a multi-agency strategy to manage demand for services, with more investment in diagnostic aftercare to make sense of individual context and provide personalised support.Our hope of understanding this is to begin from that more complex picture rather than a tug-of-war between the neuro‑affirmative and the hyper‑sceptical “it’s just a fad” positions.Sagal HassanChild and adolescent psychoanalytic psychotherapist, The SokeFor too long, the narrative around autism and ADHD assessments has been shaped by ideology rather than evidence. Wes Streeting’s recent announcement is a much-needed intervention and first step in tackling overdiagnosis (Wes Streeting orders review of mental health diagnoses as benefit claims soar, 3 December).Cowboy diagnostic providers – startups and online services with no qualified clinicians – are a real threat, diagnosing almost anyone they assess with little trace of scientific rigour. Such practices waste public money, undermine genuine diagnoses and cause real, long-term harm to their patients.Conditions such as autism and ADHD are notoriously difficult to diagnose and only qualified, regulated professionals following clinical standards of care should be assessing patients for them. A diagnosis is permanent and carries significant implications, which means the children and adults being wrongly diagnosed will likely live with the consequences for the rest of their lives.Instead of championing high diagnosis rates, as clinicians we should be promoting quality, evidence-based assessments that ensure the right people are seen at the right time and can access the help they need. This is an incredibly difficult and polarising issue, but the health secretary is right to make a stand.Dr Lisa WilliamsFounder and clinical director, The Autism ServiceHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

The head coach also insisted his politeness should not be mistaken for weakness after leaving Salah out of theChampions Leaguegame against Inter on Tuesday.Slot gave his first public ­reaction on Monday to Salah’s incendiary interview at Leeds when ­previewing ­Liverpool’s match at San Siro. He denied Salah’s claims that their relationship had broken down and said only the Egypt international knows who supposedly threw him under a bus and wants him out of the club.Self-indulgent Mohamed Salah betrays teammates and hastens end of Liverpool era | Andy HunterRead moreSalah trained on Monday for the second day in succession before Slot told him directly that he would not be travelling to Italy for the Champions League game. The decision to remove the 33-year-old from selection for a short period was taken by the Liverpool hierarchy in conjunction with Slot, and with the full support of the Dutch coach. Salah could also miss the home game against Brighton on Saturday. He is due to report for Africa Cup of Nations duty with Egypt on Monday and could be away from Liverpool until mid-January, when Saudi Arabian interest in the forward is likely to be rekindled.Asked whether there is a way back for Salah at Liverpool, who have the player under contract until the summer of 2027, Slot replied: “I am a firm believer that there is always a possibility to return for a player. But that is not … I can leave it with that I think.”The head coach, however, was pressed again on the possibility that the third highest goalscorer in Liver­pool’s history may have played his last game for the club. “I have no clue,” Slot replied. “I cannot answer that question at this point in time.”Slot said that he was taken aback by Salah’s comment that their once‑healthy relationship has broken down, having beenbenched for three consecutive gamesfor the first time in his Liverpool career. “That is not the way I feel, but he has the right to feel how he feels things,” Slot said.View image in fullscreenArne Slot said he was baffled by the claim that he had no relationship with Mohamed Salah.Photograph: Peter Byrne/PA“I haven’t felt that at all until Satur­day evening for sure. When I don’t play someone usually players don’t like the manager that much but he was really respectful to the staff and manager, his teammates and he trained very hard so it was a surprise to me when I heard the comments he gave. But it is not the first or last time a player who doesn’t play says something similar to what he did. But my reaction to that is clear and that’s why he is not here tonight.”Slot said it was difficult to know who Salah was referring to when he claimed someone at Liverpool had thrown him under a bus. But he admitted having only a brief exchange with the player since Saturday – when informing him of the decision to leave him behind on Merseyside – and insisted the club’s reaction demonstrated his authority.“Usually I’m calm, I’m polite,” Slot said. “But that doesn’t mean I’m weak so if a player has these comments about so many things then it’s up to me and the club to react. We reacted in a way you can see – he’s not here.”Liverpool would have been low on numbers against Inter even if Salah had been included on the trip. Cody Gakpo, Federico Chiesa and Wataru Endo are absent through illness and injury – Chiesa could fly out on the day of the game should he recover from illness, while Gakpo is out for a few weeks having picked up an injury against Leeds – leaving Slot with a squad of 19 players that includes three goalkeepers and three teenagers.The first-choice keeper Alisson also addressed the media on Monday and said he hoped Salah would play for Liverpool again. “I don’t think anything but I hope he plays again for the club,” he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Brazil international said: “Before Arne came in everyone talks about the huge challenge being a substitute for Jürgen Klopp. Now it looks like everyone takes for granted what we achieved last season. It should not be taken for granted. That should be enough but we believe in his knowledge. We believe in his style of play and that he is capable of helping us to turn around this situation.

Among a series of criticisms, the former Liverpool player said: “He’s chosen this weekend to do this, and he’s waited I think to choose a bad result for Liverpool. Supporters, the manager, everyone at the club feels like they’re in the gutter and he’s chosen that time to go for the manager and maybe get him sacked.“I’d remind Salah and his agent that before he came to Liverpool he was known as the man who failed at Chelsea.

Victories are scarcely this comfortable, even if Ruben Amorim’s side needed to navigate the briefest of scares when Wolves equalised with half-time looming. United turned on the style after the break, the manager clenching his right fist when Mason Mount made it 3-1 with a smart volley, building on goals by Bryan Mbeumo and Bruno Fernandes, who also rounded off the scoring from the penalty spot.For Wolves, this was yet another demoralising defeat, a13th in 15 league matches. The last time they tasted victory, in April, Matheus Cunha, who enjoyed his return to Molineux in United’s all-black strip, opened the scoring. Nine fan groups totalling thousands of supporters protested against the Wolves owner, Fosun, by boycotting the first 15 minutes. Supporters voiced their anger at the players, too. “You’re not fit to wear the shirt,” they sang, and jeered Jørgen Strand Larsen when he was taken off. There were pantomime laughs when the fourth official indicated at least nine minutes of stoppage time.Wolves 1-4 Manchester United: Premier League – as it happenedRead moreThis season, primed to end in relegation, has been a painful slow puncture. Still, only another 23 league games to go. Next up, a trip to the leaders Arsenal on Saturday. How many points will Wolves take from the remaining 69 available? Will they beat Derby’s unwanted record-low tally of 11 in 2007-08? At this stage last season Southampton, who ended with 12, were on five. The mood music will not change anytime soon and it threatens to be a long six months for Rob Edwards, for whom this was a fourth straight defeat since taking charge. The stands were almost empty long before the final whistle, after which Cunha saluted those who stayed until the end. Wolves are a shell compared to the club that reached Europe under Nuno Espírito Santo.If ever a goal summed up Wolves’s season, it was Fernandes’s first here. André, facing his own goal, was dispossessed by Casemiro midway inside the Wolves half and the United midfielder located Cunha on the edge of the 18-yard box. United were two v one. Cunha teed up Fernandes, who, after losing his footing, recovered to shoot after keeping Emmanuel Agbadou at arm’s length, the Wolves resistance feeble. Fernandes’s shot was tame by his standards but beat Sam Johnstone in the Wolves goal. Yerson Mosquera was left in a tangle in the back of the net. Four minutes later, Cunha would have doubled their advantage but for Toti Gomes’s heroic goalline clearance.Even the most optimistic Wolves supporters are resigned to relegation. Anger has largely been superseded by apathy. Even the early jeers for Cunha were half hearted. “You sold the team, now sell the club,” was the now-familiar strain that rained down from the South Bank as those absent for the opening quarter of an hour went to their seats. Wolves’s supporters cycled through the chants against the club’s executive chair, Jeff Shi. “I understand the frustration,” Edwards said. “I won’t tell fans what to do. I’d love them to support the players but they have to see effort and commitment in return.”Few envisaged Wolves levelling on the verge of half-time, Jean-Ricner Bellegarde restoring parity. Or, indeed, Wolves being cheered off – and not sarcastically – as they headed down the tunnel at the break. Gomes crossed the ball from left to right and Ki-Jana Hoever sent it back where it came from. David Møller Wolfe blasted it into the box and Bellegarde, on the stretch, diverted the ball low into the bottom corner past Senne Lammens.View image in fullscreenMason Mount celebrates scoring against Wolves in their 4-1 win.Photograph: Darren Staples/AFP/Getty ImagesUnited reappeared intent on regaining the lead. “The manager had a few things to say,” Mount said diplomatically of Amorim’s half-time message. Cunha rolled Ladislav Krejci on the edge of the box but, looking for the far top corner, he spooned his shot over. Mbeumo saw a shot blocked, Agbadou thwarted Cunha. United’s pressure was unrelenting.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Cunha sent a weighted pass through for Diogo Dalot, flying forward on the overlap, who squared the ball for Mbeumo to do the rest. It was a strike that killed any hopes of an unlikely comeback win. Mount, who scoredthe winner at Palaceon United’s previous away outing, made sure. Agbadou stopped a goalbound shot by Fernandes but then seemed to think it was job done. Fernandes reclaimed possession and scooped a pass into the box, where Mount, played onside by Agbadou, arrived unmarked to volley in.There was still time for more United cheer. First, the travelling supporters rejoiced at the 79th-minute arrival of Kobbie Mainoo, this his third appearance since October. Then, Mosquera was penalised for handball and Fernandes scored his second of the night from the spot, lashing his penalty low into the corner to lift United into sixth.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueWolverhampton WanderersManchester Unitedmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Overconfident. Overblown. Over there. And now justover. We know how this goes from here, don’t we? We know this cycle.The days since England’sdefeat in Brisbanehave boiled down to a real-time competition to become the hate-click boss, to describe in the most sensual, eviscerating detail the depth of England’s badness – not just at cricket, but at the molecular, existential level.Right now everything is turned up to 11. Bring on the flamethrowers. Scour this filth from the earth. It’s time to burn this Baz-house down. So we have pitch maps of shame, fifth-stump drive montages, deconstructions of the basic energy at the Gabba, when even the players’ faces seemed to collapse, from handsome, alpha dogs romping out in mid‑afternoon, to weak-chinned lost souls under the evening lights, eyes hollow, hair straggly, like acid casualties at Woodstock.McCullum’s ‘overprepared’ Ashes remark may prove England’s Bazball epitaphRead moreWe have a race to capture the exact styling of the end times. What will its epitaph be? The current favourite is Brendon McCullum’s post-match TV interview, an experience that felt, in the moment, like having burning hot kebab skewers made entirely from vibes and golf driven into both eyeballs.Even as McCullum said the thing – “If anything we overprepared” – you could almost hear the clank of belts being loosed, steak knives sharpened. There it is. Hiswe need to look at the data. Hispeace in our time. Hiswe’re ALL RIGHT, fist raised to the party conference hall.So we can do the horror. But there is a problem here too, and a familiar one. There is rarely any suggestion of what to do next, or what parts to keep, just the urge to purge, to annihilate the dominant thesis. Reject. Reanimate the old ways. Concrete over the flaws of the present with the flaws of the past.But what if there was another way? What if it was possible not just to say how England are bad, but why and how to improve it? Who would be the best person to tell us this, outside exasperated ex-pros and scalpel-penned hacks?If we accept that the greatest flaw of the Baz-verse is its philistinism, the rejection of knowledge and theory, then the answer is probably someone with an actual interest in these things, meatheads v pointy heads.View image in fullscreenBrendon McCullum (left), the England head coach, made himself a target for criticism by saying his side ‘overprepared’ before the Test in Brisbane.Photograph: Robbie Stephenson/PARob Ferley is a former Kent and Nottinghamshire spin bowler turned professional coach and one of the most innovative thinkers in English cricket. Ferley is outside Bazball. He also played with, respects and is fascinated by its grand wizard Rob Key. With Dr James Wallace, lecturer in Sports Science at the University of Brighton, he has formed Square OneCricket, a kind of sports science brains trust based at its Falmer campus facility.As an antidote to the burn‑it-down dynamic, this page asked Ferley to come up with a state-of-Bazball briefing paper, evidence-based and drawing on current theory. So what do people who have spent a professional life trying to understand coaching culture think about a system that rejects it?An important message. This is not an apologia for the regime, whose only real achievement in Australia so far is to have found a more extreme way of being bad. Factor in depth of resources, extended prep, the freedom to create an entire cult-like way of being. Fold in the fact England have won 13 of their past 39 Tests and one-day internationals, a win ratio worse than Ange Postecoglou at Spurs, worse than their predecessors, the Silverwood-Mott axis, who won 17 of their last 39 matches, and England aren’t just bad right now, they’re mega-bad.Lose again in Adelaide and resigning on the spot is the only real Bazball move left. Run towards the carpet slippers. Be where your sofa is. So we can do the horror, because the horror is real. But it is also reductive. What are the good parts here?So we enterPart 1: What Bazballgetsright.Even in the middle of failure, there has been one major gain. As Ferley puts it: “Bazball revolutionised how Englandfeel. It’s probably the best time ever to be an England cricketer. So that is genuinely remarkable, isn’t it?”How did they do this? “Players feel trusted, empowered and unburdened by fear of failure.” Yes this sounds funny now, havingcollapsed like an overdunked biscuitat first contact in Australia. But it is also a major achievement in English cricket, which has so often been hampered by the absence of these qualities.Key to these early gains wasReinvestmenttheory andconstraints-ledapproach.“Reinvestment theory suggests that overthinking technical details inhibits performance. Bazball’s messaging – ‘trust your game’, ‘play with freedom’, ‘express yourself’ – limits this excessive cognitive load.” Ben Duckett, for example. Did you really think he would average 40 as a Test opener? Duckett has been reinvested. He was ready for this.We also havePositive self‑fulfilling prophecies, whereby: “Stokes and McCullum use belief as a weapon … The message is consistent:we believe in you. This creates belonging, identity and confidence.” But we get into trickier ground underAvalues-oriented culturewith its “clear emphasis on the psychological and emotional domains. These are enjoyment, self-expression, connection, mental freedom, reduced fear.” This may be falling apart right now, but it worked while it worked. “In short, Bazball is 85% built on solid evidence and powerful principles.” But don’t worry. “There are clear gaps” where “Bazball is incomplete or unsupported by evidence”.The first isHigh support but low challenge. “The current environment is extremely supportive, but it seems to lack challenge. High support without high challenge creates comfort safety and enjoyment, but not necessarily excellence … the current model feels too comfortable.”One example is the apparent lack of detail as opposed to simply energy. Zak Crawley has talked about picking up a mood on how to bat, never actually being told to get a quick 30, just sensing it was the right thing from the nature of McCullum’s silence when he walks back into the dressing room. How’s that going to break down under actual pressure?Next isLack of tactical adaptability and perceptual‑decision training.“A constraints-led approach shouldn’t meanabsenceof tactical development. England speak a language of freedom, but look unable to adapt when conditions change … they cannot change their approach under pressure.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

What to make of this after a Test where up to 15 wickets fell to balls that could have been left? Why have there been no discussions? Or just one discussion? This is literally the job.Next problem,One-size-fits-all autonomy.“Autonomy is preached, but the culture has converged on a single way of playing. The team ethos has become: ‘This is how we play.’ That risks suppressing penalising players who think or operate differently.”Think here of Ollie Pope, who would surely look happier under a different regime. As it is, nobody knows what Pope’s real depths are, his actual core skills. Although it seems likely these might be resilience and slow craft. This is before we even get to Harry Brook, who is in danger of swallowing his own talent, always going for the sugar rush, shooting for the sun.View image in fullscreenOllie Pope gives the impression that his skillset would be more suited to a different England regime.Photograph: MB Media/Getty ImagesSpeaking of whichOverreliance on an ‘entertainment-first’ narrative. “Entertainment matters, but high performance requires consequence. England sound like a team enjoying themselves more than a team striving to be the best.” There is a surprising truth here. Bazball is dull. These are one-note iconoclasts, predictable mavericks, like a manufactured punk band snarling to order an American talkshow.Most important of all perhaps isPsychological comfort without performance accountability. “High performance requires consequence. If players aretoosafe it can lead to: complacency, reduced hunger, acceptance of mediocrity, overconfidence that becomes blind spots.”Stokes expressed surprise in Brisbane that England are bad at coping with pressure. Maybe this is because they don’t allow themselves to foster it, but look instead like a team that have been told they are special and actually believe it.As forUnclear values, well now we’re talking. “Bazball has a vibe, an energy, a style – but what are the actual values? Entertainment? Positivity? Bravery? Winning? These are cultural traits, not performance values. Great teams have clear, explicit values that guide behaviour, decision-making and accountability.”This is the other thing England have achieved in Australia. They haven’t just played badly – they have made themselves unusually unlikeable. Other England teams have lost like drowning men, lost like it hurt. This England team are still trying to be cool in defeat, to talk about going for beers in the sting of 2-0 down.So we get on toSelection bias and favouritism risks. “High belief encourages confidence – but it can also create blindspots. There is a risk of loyalty overriding objectivity, leading to a small pool of players being backed regardless of evidence.” Selection is confusing. The message is: we will not select on runs and wickets. We will pick you on attitude. So go out there and play in a style that keeps you in the team. Haseeb Hameed, for example, has clearly been making the wrong kind of runs.Finally we haveSchedule narrative. “The constant commentary around the schedule may reinforce a self-fulfilling belief that England are uniquely fatigued. But is this evidence-based? It’s unclear whether the schedule is uniquely difficult – or whether Englandbelieveit is because of their cultural echo chamber.”So despite talking about how much they play, England look short of games. They look fit but also tired and scrambled. In conclusion: “Bazball has transformed English cricket. It has rehabilitated confidence, restored identity and created a liberated environment. But the final 15% – tactical adaptability, challenge, accountability, perceptual development, value clarity and diversity of thought – is the difference between being inspiring and being world class.”That does sound about right, doesn’t it? Or at least a more reasoned response to the sense of a team built as a monument to a single idea. For now England are probably right to take some time in Noosa, to relax and regroup and follow the only path they really have open to them at this stage. The motto of their chosen resort is “plan, play, explore”. Just don’t expect this regime to do much more than the play part.Explore more on these topicsAshes 2025-26Brendon McCullumBen StokesEngland cricket teamAustralia cricket teamThe AshesCricketcommentShareReuse this content"

His title rival Max Verstappen won the race but fell short of Norris by two points. The fight remained tight to the decisive last round with Norris’s McLaren teammate, Oscar Piastri, who had led the championship for a large part of the season, also in the mix for the final race but who ultimately finished third.Lando Norris claims he was often unmatchable on way to F1 title gloryRead more“It was like a movie,” the 26‑year‑old said. “As much as I was trying to avoid every bump possible I was also remembering all of those moments from the very beginning, driving a go-kart for the first time ever, my first time on the track in a go-kart, the races I had, the karting world championship I won in 2014 and many different memories.“I was watching me. I was living it but I was also watching me drive around from a bird’s-eye view and this was all within the space of a couple of minutes, through to the last seven years ofMcLarenand the good and bad moments of the season.”Norris also revealed he had partied until 6am with his friends at the W hotel that overlooks the Yas Marina circuit and ended the night at a McDonald’s. “I had a Sausage McMuffin. Was it the breakfast of champions? Certainly not, I regretted it straightaway.”The Briton had to hold his nerve to see out a tense fight in Abu Dhabi and pull off some bold overtakes to ensure he claimed the third place he needed but said that at the close he was unsure how he would feel when he finally took the championship he had dreamed of winning since he was a child.“I had no idea what to expect,” he said. “With three laps to go I was like: ‘I am getting pretty close and I’m not feeling anything yet.’ I was like: ‘Is this going to mean a lot to me?’“Then the next lap I started having these cool flashbacks. It was like a montage of my life and going under the bridge for the final time and imagining my mum in the garage and that made me emotional.“The best memory was when I came round the final corner and this is now from my view from my eyes inside my visor and seeing the ­chequered flag and that moment of lifting off and being able to cry. I want to savour that moment because that was the ‘it’ moment.”View image in fullscreenLando Norris said he was unsure how much the moment would mean to him as he neared clinching the F1 world title.Photograph: Nicolas Economou/NurPhoto/ShutterstockAs the 11th British driver to win the world championship he stands in illustrious company but was insistent the newfound fame, and all that is associated with it, would not change him. “From the exterior it will change my life but it won’t change me and how I live it. I really hope it doesn’t anyway. I don’t want to be that kind of person,” he said.Norris was involved in a battle with Verstappen for the title last season, albeit coming from well behind the Dutchman and the McLaren team principal, Andrea Stella, believed this was one of the two key areas he had identified that had enabled Norris to close out his first title.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSport in FocusFree weekly newsletterOur picture editors select their favourite sporting images from the past week, from the spectacular to the powerful, and with a little bit of fun thrown inEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

[But] I think Lando elevated his sense of status, like: ‘I can compete with Max.’”Norris also struggled with the car for the opening half of this season, not having the feel for the front grip he prefers and it particularly cost him in qualifying. It was a period when Piastri took the lead of the championship with a series of enormously assured drives.The team were ultimately able to bring developments to the car around the front suspension such that Norris felt much more comfortable and Stella maintained that the way he handled the difficult period was key.“This season there was another important turning point in my view, which is the way Lando responded to the difficulties we had at the start of the season,” he said. “It was the start of a process which was structured, holistic, it involved personal development, professional driving, racecraft.“It makes me particularly glad that Lando could capitalise on this, because this has been something that I’ve not necessarily seen many times before in terms of the amount of work, the people involved, and the rate of development.”Explore more on these topicsLando NorrisFormula One 2025McLarenFormula OneMotor sportnewsShareReuse this content"

His relationship with Ruben Amorim had collapsed by the end of his five‑year stint at United and he was banished from the squad in pre‑season. Amorim felt he had failed to follow tactical instructions and, before the transfer was completed, said he sensed Garnacho wanted “a different thing with different leadership”.Mohamed Salah left out of Liverpool’s Champions League trip to InterRead moreSpeaking the evening before Chelsea’sChampions Leaguematch at Atalanta, Garnacho was asked whether he harboured any regrets at all about the way things had ended. “No,” was the extent of his response, a word subsequently repeated when questioned on whether he felt any sadness.Garnacho was keener to ­elaborate on his bond with Enzo Maresca, who has worked intensively on the Argentinian’s positioning off the ball. “Sometimes in life you have to change things to take a step ­forward or improve as a player,” he said. “I think it was the right moment and the right club, so it was an easy decision. I came here to play my football and show people the player I am.“The most important thing is confidence. [Maresca] speaks with me every week and I think we are going to get better, me as a player and the team together, with time. We started the season three months ago so it’s building confidence between the manager and the player.”Chelsea will hope Garnacho, who scored in their previous Champions Leagueaway assignment at Qarabag, is at his scintillating best against an Atalanta side that are below them only on goal difference in the sprawling league phase table. Maresca’s team sit ­seventh and the jeopardy in this fixture, such as it is, lies in trying to avoid a scramble out of the ­playoff spots after Christmas. It is their third consecutive match on the road after thedefeat by Leedsanddraw at Bournemouth.Maresca spoke highly of Atalanta’s work as a reference point for Italian football under their former manager Gian Piero Gasperini. They are now led by Raffaele Palladino, a Gasperini protege with whom Maresca crossed paths briefly as a player at Juventus, and he warned that his players would not lack company in the attractively renovated New Balance Arena.“Now many teams [in Italy] try to do something similar to what ­Atalanta has done in the last years with Gasperini,” Maresca said. “So you can see most of the teams played five at the back, most of the teams tried to play man-to-man everywhere. If you go to the toilet, they follow you everywhere.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Nor will it include Liam Delap, whose injury-plagued season worsened when he picked up a shoulder injury at Bournemouth. Maresca said Delap had not sustained a fracture but did not give a timeframe for his comeback.Six years ago the outcast Raheem Sterling scored an 11-minute hat-trick against Atalanta for Manchester City. Maresca was asked whether Sterling, who has not played for Chelsea since May 2024, has any route back into his thoughts. “In terms of Raheem it’s the same thing I said about Axel [Disasi], they are Chelsea players,” he said. “Now also we are in December, January is coming so anything can happen, we’ll see.”Explore more on these topicsChelseaAtalantaChampions LeaguenewsShareReuse this content"

If those are the stats, which the top teams generally tend to follow, why would you not kick the ball?“If I was a head coach of a country right now and the World Cup’s in two years, you’re going: ‘OK, is there anyone who’s 19, 20, a second-row or back-row who’s a really good athlete? Can we make him into a winger in two years? Go chase some kicks?’ Genuinely, why would you not do that?”Byrne added that current refereeing of the ruck makes kicking even more attractive, and that rugby union consequently risks becoming one-dimensional in terms of players’ size.“The way the ball carrier can no longer roll or move [at the ruck] – it’s made it harder to hold on to the ball, I would argue,” Byrne said. “That’s even more reason to kick. I think pretty much everybody’s gone that way.“I also think it is moving away from having a team full of an array of talent: [currently] you’ve got some players who are unbelievably good footballers – kickers, passers, who read the game. Whereas now [under the new laws], we just need a couple of kickers and a load of good athletes to chase the ball. Do we need those small, silky backs any more? I don’t think so. Why would we?”The 30-year-old, who has 22 Ireland caps, also criticised the stop-start nature of the club season due to international windows. “It does annoy me that we have two massive international blocks,” he said. “You don’t see the Premier League stopping for four weeks [in November], and it certainly doesn’t stop for six weeks, like during the Six Nations.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

After they overcame a stubborn Leicester City side3-0 on Sundayto claim a ninth straight win, it would appear the answer to that question is “significantly” compared to recent seasons, as they demonstrated a unity and a composure that has perhaps evaded many title hopefuls of old. December last year brought moments when Manchester City’s campaign began to unravel, through a combination of injuries and surprise defeats. On Sunday they looked like potential champions in the sense that they found a way to win what could very easily have become a frustrating game, against a back five in a low block. Andrée Jeglertz pointed to this professionalism and calmness at full time: “I’m very proud and pleased with the patience the players are showing, the trust, the belief. They are not starting to yell at each other, they just keep believing in each other and believing in what we are doing.”Tom GarryReborn and ruthless: can Manchester City realise their WSL title dream?Read moreChelsea’s historic unbeaten run endedIt had to happen at some point, didn’t it? But few would have anticipated that Everton would be the team to end Chelsea’s historic 34-game unbeaten WSL run. The reigning champions had not lost a league fixture in 585 days, dating back to May 2024 when they suffered a defeat to Liverpool. Despite having 79% of the possession against Everton and 30 shots on goal, Chelsea could not make the most of their chances and ultimately paid the price, leaving them six points behind league leaders Manchester City. Sonia Bompastor, for whom this was a first taste of defeat in the WSL, said: “It’s a really frustrating result. It’s tough, but I think if we analyse the performance and look at the statistics, I don’t think the players could have done a lot more. Maybe we could have been more clinical. We created enough shots, crosses, and we hit the woodwork three times. It’s just one of these games where the ball didn’t want to go in.”Emillia HawkinsSpurs eye Champions League spot under HoMartin Ho’s shake-up of Tottenham is starting to show results. A frantic final 10 minutes against Aston Villa was blockbuster viewing as Bethany England and Olivia Holdt scored to seal a stunning 2-1 comeback. Already they are just one point short of their total points haul (20) last season. They’re also a point away from a Champions League spot. The Spurs squad has not changed hugely, with a handful of players exiting in the summer and two signings. But what seems to have changed is their mentality. Jessica Naz being carried off with an injury in the second half felt like a make-or-break situation – they chose to make the best of it. “It’s just a never-say-never attitude,” said England, “It was important to make sure we weren’t sulking or accepting a defeat to a team we know we can beat.”Renuka OdedraView image in fullscreenOlivia Holdt celebrates after scoring Tottenham’s winner against Aston Villa.Photograph: Jess Hornby/WSL/Getty ImagesFamiliar failings for West Ham before six-pointerOn the face of it maybe West Ham shouldn’t be too disappointed with the 2-1 defeat at Manchester United on Sunday. After all United had won each of their five home games against the Hammers in the WSL by an aggregate score of 17-0. As it happened it was a familiar theme that undid the visitors with Dominique Janssen’s fantastic free-kick securing the three points for Marc Skinner’s side. West Ham have struggled with set-pieces this season and have now conceded from seven of them in their 10 league games – the most in the top flight. The West Ham manager, Rehanne Skinner, was not too downbeat after the defeat. “The way we showed ourselves today shows the improvements we have made,” she told the BBC. “The fact that we are so disappointed not to have come away with anything shows the attitude and belief among the players.” Next, though, comes a game against Liverpool, the only side behind the Hammers in the WSL table.Réshma Raoskip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Yet, despite two draws and no wins from nine games, the performances of Gareth Taylor’s side, particularly inSaturday’s 2-1 loss to Arsenaland their back-to-back points earned against Brighton and Chelsea in the two preceding fixtures, have been promising. They need signings, though and “lots” of them, according to Taylor. The manager conceded coming into a club with so little resources, after working at Manchester City, was “really tough”. “I like a challenge. This is a real challenge,” he said. “The girls are top class, they really are. They’re really humble. They want to be coached. You can see that they want to get better and improve. We want this thing to work. I am a coach that never usually compromises on my game style or method or philosophy but of course I need players that can execute that as well. So, at the moment, I am making compromises. I’ve been honest and open about that and I’d be daft not to be.” Now, the board needs to cough up.Suzanne WrackNnadozie proves one of the signings of the seasonChiamaka Nnadozie is looking like one of the signings of the season and impressed once more in Brighton’s narrow 1-0 win over London City Lionesses. Before Sunday’s game, the Nigerian goalkeeper had made the joint highest number of stops in the league (42) alongside Leicester City’s Janina Leitzig and had a save percentage (80.8%) that is second only to Hannah Hampton’s. The 25-year-old does live by the “no risk, no reward” mantra but, despite the odd scare, her shot-stopping is second to none. She made five saves to deny the hosts at Bromley, proving a crucial cog in a Brighton defence that came under pressure but never broke. The visitors were also helped by London City’s wastefulness in front of goal. The Seagulls’ out-of-possession work is the part of their game that has developed the most in 2025 and they boast the fourth-joint meanest defence in the league. The consistency of the centre-back partnership between Caitlin Hayes and Moeka Minami has been key to this.Sophie DowneyExplore more on these topicsWomen's Super LeagueWomen's footballManchester City WomenLiverpool FC WomenArsenal WomenChelsea WomenTottenham Hotspur WomenfeaturesShareReuse this content"

West Sussex county council, which is leading the clearup operation, urged people to stay away. It said it needed time and room to clear containers – and bananas – away.The saga began on Saturday when16 containers went overboardfrom the refrigerated cargo ship Baltic Klipper in the Solent, the stretch of water between the Isle of Wight and the British mainland.The incident disrupted some shipping movements and the P&O Cruises ship Iona was delayed in departing from Southampton because of it.Eight of the containers were reported as carrying bananas, two plantains and one avocados. The remaining five were empty. Some have broken open, allowing bunches of bananas to float on to the beaches.View image in fullscreenWest Sussex county council urged people to stay away to give it room and time for the cleanup operation.Photograph: Jamie Lashmar/PA MediaThe coastguard, alongside West Sussex fire and rescue service and Sussex police, put cordons in place and asked people not to go nearby.Initially, the coastguard put out a statement reminding people that “all wreck material found in the UK has to be reported to HM Coastguard’s receiver of wreck”.It pointed people in the direction ofa form they needed to followand said those who failed to declare items within 28 days were breaking the law and could be fined £2,500.The receiver of the wreck made headlines in 2007 when containers washed offthe beached cargo ship MSC Napoliand made land in Devon.People arrived from across the UK to scavenge motorbikes, carpets, beauty creams, shoes, golf clubs, oil paintings,even oak wine barrels(which made it feel more Whisky Galore!).View image in fullscreenParts of a container that has washed ashore on Selsey beach in West Sussex.Photograph: Jamie Lashmar/PAThis time the receiver, a former police detective called Steve White, is not needed.

Itdocked in Mexico and the Netherlandsbefore heading towards Portsmouth. It was close to the Hampshire port when the containers apparently slipped off.The coastguard has been searching for the missing containersusing helicopters and fixed-wing planes.West Sussex county council warned people to stay away from containers that had made land. “Do not approach the containers, they may be hazardous. Please avoid the area. Allow us to make the site safe,” it said.⚠️ Public safety notice:Following an incident yesterday, two large shipping containers have washed up on Selsey beach.

But it did not agree to acquire WBD’s traditional television assets, including the news network CNN and the Discovery channel.Paramount’s all-cash tender offer sent directly to shareholders on Monday morning would be for the entire company, and puts a total enterprise value of $108.4bn on WBD, a major premium to its stock price.‘This merger must be blocked’: Netflix-Warner Bros deal faces fierce backlashRead moreIn making its case to shareholders, Paramount claimed its acquisition of the company provides significantly better value for shareholders, and would be much likelier to survive regulatory scrutiny. WBD said it would “carefully review and consider” the bid, and advise its shareholders on how to respond within two weeks.David Ellison and his father, the billionaire tech mogul Larry Ellison, whose family is financially backing the offer, are both friendly with the Trump administration, which had previously indicated that it supported a Paramount purchase of WBD. Larry Ellison, founder of Oracle,had even had early conversationswith a senior Trump aide about what changes he might want to see at CNN.Donald Trump has praised recent changes at Paramount since its acquisition by the Ellisons, including theselection of the heterodox writer Bari Weissas editor in chief of CBS News. Paramount is also bringing back the Rush Hour franchise for a fourth film, reportedly at the request of Trump.Shortly before the Ellisons won regulatory approval for their takeover of Paramount, the firmagreed to pay$16m to settle a lawsuit filed by Trump, who had claimed a pre-election interview with the 2024 Democratic candidate for president, Kamala Harris, was falsely edited. Many legal experts had dismissed the lawsuit as “meritless” and unlikely to hold up under the first amendment.A regulatory filing on Monday revealed that the Ellisons’ bid for WBD was backed by outside funders including Affinity Partners, an investment fund founded by Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner; Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund; and the Qatar Investment Authority.In a statement, David Ellison called the Netflix deal “an inferior proposal which exposes shareholders to a mix of cash and stock, an uncertain future trading value of the Global Networks linear cable business and a challenging regulatory approval process”.“WBD shareholders deserve an opportunity to consider our superior all-cash offer for their shares in the entire company,” he said. “Our public offer, which is on the same terms we provided to the Warner Bros Discovery board of directors in private, provides superior value, and a more certain and quicker path to completion.”During an industry event on Monday afternoon, Netflix leaders expressed little concern about the Paramount bid. Netflix co-chief executive Ted Sarandos said the Paramount offer was “totally expected”. “We have a deal done, and we are really happy with the deal,” he added. “We’re super confident we are going to get it across.”Warner Bros Disaster? Netflix inks deal for troubled Hollywood giantRead moreEllison’s Paramount Skydance had already made several offers that were rejected during the bidding process for WBD. The company said on Monday it was concerned that shareholders “were not presented [the] most compelling and superior transaction”.Last week, attorneys for Paramount sent a letter to WBD suggesting the company was not fairly considering its offer. “It has become increasingly clear, through media reporting and otherwise, that WBD appears to have abandoned the semblance and reality of a fair transaction process, thereby abdicating its duties to stockholders, and embarked on a myopic process with a predetermined outcome that favors a single bidder,” they wrote.Netflix’sproposed acquisitionof the studio and streaming assets of WBD fleetingly provided some relief for some employees at CNN, who had been concerned about the prospects of a merger between the network and CBS News, now led by Weiss.“I think this is the best outcome for CNN for sure,” a senior network producer told the Guardian after the Netflix acquisition was announced, describing a “palpable sense of relief” at the network. But, the person added, “there is still a hell of a lot of anxiety around the Discovery Global spin-off and what comes next”.In a memo to CNN employees on Friday, the network’s CEO, Mark Thompson, framed the deal as a positive. “I’ve been asked by many of you what today’s news means for us,” he wrote. “And the answer is that it will enable us to continue to roll out our strategy to secure a great future for CNN by successfully navigating our digital transition.”Some employees at CBS News had also feared a merger with CNN’s parent company, and that a tie-up could lead to significant job losses. “A merger with CNN is the one thing that would make me genuinely worried about losing my job,” one CBS News staffer said. (Paramount’s offer on Monday noted that the combination of television networks would “dramatically improve cash flow and increase efficiencies, leading to a division more capable of managing structural declines”.)Paramount’s offer on Monday for WBD could re-ignite those concerns for employees at both networks. If the Netflix deal moves forward, however, CNN will be spun off – as planned – into a standalone company, encompassing WBD’s traditional television networks, from Cartoon Network to TLC.On a conference call with analysts, David Ellison did not answer a question about whether he would be interested in acquiring the television group by itself if the greater Netflix deal goes through.On Sunday evening, before Paramount tabled its hostile bid, Trump had said he would be personally involved in the review for the Netflix-WBD transaction, which he said would have implications for competition considering Netflix’s “big market share”. But he had kind words for Netflix’s co-chief executive Ted Sarandos, who visited the White House recently.Several US politicians, including Senator Elizabeth Warren, and entertainment unions, however,had expressed strong reservationsabout the deal.Because no television licenses would be transferred in a potential acquisition, the acquisition of WBD is very unlikely to be subject to the review of the Federal Communications Commission and its Trump-picked chair, Brendan Carr. But anti-trust concerns around any such deal would be reviewed by the Department of Justice.“Paramount is highly confident in achieving expeditious regulatory clearance for its proposed offer,” the company said on Monday, “as it enhances competition and is pro-consumer, while creating a strong champion for creative talent and consumer choice.”The Ellisons’ offer is set to expire at 5pm on 8 January, unless it is extended.On the Monday call, David Ellison said the company’s offers for WBD had not received a response. “We’re here to fight for value – for our shareholders and for WBD shareholders,” he said. “This transaction is about building more, not cutting back … Our proposal is superior to Netflix’s in every dimension.”While Trump has been very supportive of the Ellisons’ takeover of CBS News, he lashed out at the network and its new management on Monday morning for a 60 Minutes broadcast the night before, featuring the outgoing GOP House member Marjorie Taylor Greene,who told correspondent Lesley Stahlthat many Republican legislators privately mocked Trump.“My real problem with the show, however, wasn’t the low IQ traitor, it was that the new ownership of 60 Minutes, Paramount, would allow a show like this to air,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform. “THEY ARE NO BETTER THAN THE OLD OWNERSHIP, who just paid me millions of Dollars for FAKE REPORTING about your favorite President, ME! Since they bought it, 60 Minutes has actually gotten WORSE!”Explore more on these topicsBusinessWarner BrosNetflixnewsShareReuse this content"

Dark Horse, directed by Cyrus Nowrasteh and written by Mário Frias, who served as secretary of culture under Bolsonaro,started shootingthree months ago in Brazil, where Bolsonaro served as president from 2019 until 2023. He wassentencedto 27 years and three months in prison in September 2025 for leading a criminal conspiracy to stop his leftwing rival,Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, taking power, though his supporters deny the allegations and have compared the prosecution to the “lawfare” allegedly faced by Donald Trump before he was re-elected.The plot, whichinvolved a plan to assassinate Lulaand his running mate, foundered after military chiefs refused to take part. The court found that Bolsonaro and six accomplices tried to “annihilate” Brazilian democracy and return Latin America’s largest democracy to dictatorship.Frias began posting clips from the project showing Caviezel in costume as Bolsonaro on Monday. The film also stars Lynn Collins and Esai Morales, and will conclude production in Mexico and the US in 2026.Bolsonaro’s son Carlosconfirmedthe film’s existence on X, posting a photo of himself with Caviezel in costume as his father. “I know your legacy will continue to be admired by good people and envied by those who seek destruction – yet the message you imprint with every step leaves its mark on the world,” he wrote of Caviezel, ending the post with “God, Jesus and Freedom!”Based on leaks and anunofficial first look, the film appears to focus on Bolsonaro’s 2018 campaign for the presidency, emphasizing his military background. At the time, the disgraced and controversial ex-president drewinternational outragefor saying that Brazil’s Indigenous people “are increasingly becoming human beings just like us” and that he wouldrather his son die in a car accidentthan be gay, among many otherracist, homophobic and misogynistic remarks.Following his breakout in 90s and early aughts films such as The Thin Red Line and Frequency as well as The Passion of the Christ, Caviezel repositioned himself as a representative of Christian Hollywood and the conservative right. To promote his 2023 film Sound of Freedom, which some criticized asQ-Anon adjacentin its paranoia about child sex trafficking, he appeared at various Q-Anon-affiliated events and on a podcast with the Trump ally Steve Bannon. He also appeared on the Maga figure Mike Lindell’s TV channel, among otherrightwing media appearances.The actor is also a public supporter of Donald Trump, endorsing him in 2024 andreferringto him as “The new Moses”.Caviezel was most recently set to star in Resurrection of the Christ, Gibson’s follow-up to his 2004 film. He was recast after the director failed to find an adequate way to digitally de-age him.Bolsonarobeganserving his 27-year sentence, in a parking space-sized room in the capital of Brasília, last month.Explore more on these topicsBiopicsJair BolsonaroBrazilAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

It might surprise people that east London has lots of suitable habitat for these species.”Wild storks have been spotted on Thameside wetlands fairly regularly since they were reintroduced by the Knepp rewilding project, where chickshatched successfully for the first time in 2020. The popular birds, which nest on chimneys, treetops and special platforms in villages and urban areas across Europe, had been extinct as breeding birds in Britain since 1416.This year,45 wild storks fledged successfully from nests at Knepp, many then migrating to southern Europe and north Africa. They return in the spring to nest.The first captive-bred birds brought to Eastbrookend next year will be placed in a large aviary tucked in rough grass and scrubland behind the datacentre, where they can get comfortable in their surroundings.Their offspring will grow up knowing that east London is home and gradually the aviary roof will be rolled back so the birds can freely come and go, and find their own food. Storks feed on a wide variety of insects, invertebrates, amphibians and small mammals they find stalking through wetland areas.At Knepp, some of the locally born birds have paired up with wild storks. In this way, a “natural” population can be built up gradually, although experts caution that it can take decades to fully restore wild populations.According to Davenport, theRewildingEast London project is possible only because of vital habitat restoration work in the area, with marshlands being revived along the green corridor formed by the Rom/Beam, a tributary of the Thames.That restoration will be accelerated when beavers are released into a vast fenced area at Eastbrookend in 2027, with these ecosystem engineers creating new invertebrate and amphibian-rich edges to the former quarry pools, and nurseries for fish as well.The project is aimed at fostering local pride and engagement with nature. A stork officer will work with schools and the community so young people can visit, monitor and help the wild animals.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Access to nature is a social justice issue and we want to ensure all Londoners can experience the brilliant green spaces and wildlife in this city.”Dominic Twomey, the leader of Barking and Dagenham council, said: “This is a brilliant achievement for our borough and a real win for our residents ...

Less than 24 hours later, two houses on his street would be lost and the surrounding forest reduced to blackened skeletal remains.Morgan’s township of Bulahdelah, about 200km north of Sydney, was where aveteran firefighter diedon Sunday evening when he was struck by a falling tree, marking what the NSW premier called a “foreboding start” to thebushfire season.Four properties were lost in the broader Bulahdelah area, including two on Emu Creek Road, where Morgan lives, one on the Pacific Highway and one south of the township.View image in fullscreenSmoke from a bushfire disrupts traffic on the Pacific Highway near the town of Nerong south of Bulahdelah.Photograph: Blake Sharp-Wiggins/The GuardianBulahdelah is a popular stopover on the Pacific Highway for holidaymakers on their way up the mid-north coast to beach areas such as Seal Rocks, Forster and Port Macquarie.On Monday afternoon, the highway south of town was blanketed in thick, orange smoke. Water-bombing helicopters hovered overhead, assisting firefighters on the ground who were attempting to quash a blaze that had burnt 4,000 hectares since Friday.Passing trucks slowed to observe traffic cones and reduce-speed signs, the blackened gum trees and charred grass on each side of the highway evidence of how far the fire had burnt through the adjacent Myall Lakes national park. It remained at a watch and act level on Monday evening, with the alert level reducing further as conditions eased by midnight.View image in fullscreenWater-bombing helicopters over Bulahdelah.Photograph: Blake Sharp-Wiggins/The GuardianIn Bulahdelah, it would have seemed like another ordinary day if not for the helicopters circling overhead and the smell of smoke lingering in the air.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailA refuelling station for aircraft was set up at the town’s showground, transforming it into a hub for about 300 firefighters and volunteers who travelled from across the state to help.On Monday afternoon, cartons of water were being unloaded from trucks and lollies were being packaged into zip-lock bags. One firefighter estimated that they needed a bottle of water every 20 minutes when they were on the frontline.mapBillows of smoke were continuing to emit from spots of embers on Emu Creek Road, a winding rural street that hugs a creek bed south of the township where two houses were lost.On a fence post outside a burnt property, a charred teddy bear remained pinned to the log, complete with a Christmas hat.Down the road, Morgan sat on his porch with his two dogs, a little patch of grass surrounding his house the only remaining sign of how the landscape used to look. Miraculously, his property was saved, despite his neighbour’s burning to the ground.View image in fullscreenBurnt Christmas decorations hang from a telegraph pole south of Bulahdelah.Photograph: Blake Sharp-Wiggins/The GuardianHe recalled receiving a call from a friend at lunchtime on Saturday, telling him “you’ve got about half an hour and then a fire’s going to hit”. The estimate was spot on.“We sprayed the house and shed down, sprayed the fence line,” he said, and then his reaction turned to “panic”. “I thought, ‘What the hell have I got myself into’,” he said. “But I wasn’t leaving.”Fortunately, firefighters surrounded the house and managed to save it.

At least16 datacenter projects, worth a combined $64bn, have been blocked or delayed due to local opposition to rising electricity costs. The facilities’ need for huge amounts of water to cool down equipment has also proved controversial,particularly in drier areas where supplies are scarce.These seemingly parochial concerns have now multiplied to become a potent political force, helping propel Democrats to a series of emphatic recent electoral successes in governor elections inVirginiaandNew Jerseyas well as a stunningupset winin a special public service commission poll in Georgia, with candidatescampaigningon lowering power bill costs andcurbing datacenters.This threatens to be a major headache for Donald Trump, who has aggressively pushed thegrowth of AIbut also called himself the “affordability president” and vowed to cut energy costs in half in his first year.However, household electricity prices have increased by13%so far under Trump and the president recently lashed out in the wake of the election losses, calling affordability a “fake narrative” and a “con job” created by Democrats. “They just say the word,” Trump said last week. “It doesn’t mean anything to anybody. They just say it – affordability.”Yet about 80 million Americans are currentlystrugglingto pay their bills for electricityand gas, with many voters regardless of political party blaming datacenters for this, according to Charles Hua, founder and executive director of PowerLines, a non-partisan organization that aims to reduce power bills.“We saw rising utility bills become a core concern in the New Jersey, Georgia and Virginia elections, which shows us there is a new politics in America – we are entering a new era that is all about electricity prices,” Hua said.“Nobody in America wants to pay more for electricity and we saw in Georgia a meaningful chunk of conservative voters vote against the Republican incumbents, which was staggering.”Hua said the causes of the electricity cost rises were nuanced, with ageing transmission lines and damage caused by extreme weather also adding to utilities’ costs on top of the surging demand for power.But it is the growth of datacenters to service AI – with electricity consumption set to nearlytripleover the next decade, equivalent to powering 190m new homes – that is the focus ofirefor voters as well as an unlikely sweep of politicians ranging fromBernie Sanderson the left toMarjorie Taylor Greeneon the far right.More broadly, almost half of Americanssaythe cost of living in the US, including power, food and other essentials, is the worst they can ever remember it being.This focus on affordabilityhas provided a new line of attackfor an environmental movement that has struggled to counter Trump’sonslaughtupon rules that reduce air and water pollution. The president has called the climate crisis a “hoax” and clean energy a “scam” and hasslashed support forand evenblockednew wind and solar projects, even though renewables are often thecheapestand fastest options for new power generation.At the current rate of growth, datacenterscould add up to44m tons of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere by 2030, equivalent to putting an extra 10m cars on to the road and exacerbating a climate crisis that is already spurring extremeweatherdisastersand ripping apart the fabricof the American insurance market.But it is the impact upon power bills, rather than the climate crisis, that is causing anguish for most voters, acknowledged Emily Wurth, managing director of organizing at Food & Water Watch, the group behind the letter to lawmakers.“I’ve been amazed by the groundswell of grassroots, bipartisan opposition to this, in all types of communities across the US,” she said. “Everyone is affected by this, the opposition has been across the political spectrum. A lot of people don’t see the benefits coming from AI and feel they will be paying for it with their energy bills and water.“It’s an important talking point,” Wurth said of the affordability concerns. “We’ve seen outrageous utility price rises across the country and we are going to lean into this. Prices are going up across the board and this is something Americans really do care about.”Explore more on these topicsUS newsEnergyArtificial intelligence (AI)newsShareReuse this content"

Progress on any new law is likely to be slow – the strategy gives a target date of 2029.Rishi Sunakhad previously backed the former Labour MP Wayne David’s backbench attempt for a wider ban on Slapps, but the legislation did not get through parliament before the election.Lammy, a vocal supporter of tougher laws on Slapps while in opposition, confirmed for the first time in many months that the government still intended to take further steps.“We’ll protect the people who shine a light on corruption in the first place, the journalists and activists who shield the public’s right to know,” he said in his speech at the summit.“By stopping the powerful from using abusive lawsuits – so-called ‘Slapps’ – to intimidate reporters, silence investigations, and bury the truth under a mountain of legal threats. Because sunlight is always the best disinfectant.”Campaigners believe there will be a further push for legislation on Slapps by justice ministers before the next king’s speech, for either a tight standalone bill or as part of a wider one.The prime minister,Keir Starmer, who has publicly backed action on Slapps, has been said by some sources to be more cautious given his own legal background and his desire to leave it up to judges to strike out meritless cases. There was no promise to ban Slapps in Labour’s manifesto.The all-party parliamentary group on anti-corruption and responsible tax welcomed the wider strategy but said the commitment on Slapps was “lacking key details”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

While most mpox infections are mild, officials urged people who are eligible to get vaccinated to protect themselves.“It’s normal for viruses to evolve, and further analysis will help us understand more about how mpox is changing,” said Dr Katy Sinka, the head of sexually transmitted infections at UKHSA.Mpox, formerly known as monkeypox, is a viral infection related to smallpox. It can be passed on through close physical contact with mpox blisters or scabs, through touching contaminated material such as clothing, bedding or towels, or through infected people’s coughs and sneezes. It can also be caught from infected animals such as rats, mice and squirrels.Symptoms can take three weeks to appear and include a high temperature, a headache, muscle pain and exhaustion. A rash typically appears within days of the first symptoms.The UKHSA said the recombinant variant was “not unexpected” as both clades are circulating, adding that its emergence highlighted the potential for the virus to continue evolving and the importance of ongoing genomic surveillance.The World Health Organization (WHO) declared a year-long public health emergency during the mpox outbreak in 2022. A second public emergency was declared in 2024 when another mpox epidemic broke out, largely affecting the Democratic Republic of the Congo. That emergency was declared over in September this year.Figures for 2025, which run to the end of October, show that the WHO recorded nearly 48,000 confirmed mpox cases worldwide, including 201 deaths, in 94 countries.The UK has an mpox vaccination programme in place for eligible groups, including those who have multiple sexual partners, participate in group sex or visit sex-on-premises venues.Trudie Lang, professor of global health research at the University of Oxford, said: “If further cases of this strain appear in the UK, and anywhere in the world, it will be important to understand the route of transmission, the presentation and severity of disease, so we can assess whether this strain is more or less dangerous than previous ones.”Explore more on these topicsMpoxEnglandHealthInfectious diseasesShareReuse this content"

More widely, gusts of 50-60mph, and perhaps 70mph in a few spots, are expected across Wales, south-west England and Northern Ireland.“Rain is an additional impact from Storm Bram, with the possibility of 100mm over higher ground in the south of Wales and parts of Devon.“This could require escalations to existing warnings, so it’s important to stay up to date with the forecast in your area, as well as any flood warnings from your local environment agency.”Advice to the public includes to secure loose objects such as ladders and garden furniture, close and securely fasten doors and windows, and park cars in a garage.The Met Office said Storm Bram would slowly pull away during Wednesday, leaving the day windy, especially in the north of England.Thursday will be a drier day for many across the UK, with the chance of frost in central and the south-eastern parts.The RAC breakdown spokesperson Alice Simpson said: “Strong winds can make vehicles harder to control, so it’s best that drivers slow down and keep a firm grip on the wheel. Rural and coastal routes will feel the worst of the gusts, with fallen branches or even trees likely to cause disruption.“We recommend drivers check local forecasts and consider delaying non-essential trips until the storm passes.”Explore more on these topicsUK weatherIrelandEuropeScotlandWalesNorthern IrelandnewsShareReuse this content"

It’s him, 100%,” an officer was heard saying on body-worn camera video from Mangione’s arrest on 9 December last year, punctuating the remark with expletives as the officer combing the bag, Christy Wasser, held up the magazine.Wasser, a 19-year Altoona police veteran, testified on the fourth day of a pre-trial hearing as Mangione sought to bar prosecutors from using the magazine and other evidence against him, including a 9mm handgun and a notebook found during a subsequent bag search.The testimony shed light on the critical minutes after Mangione was spotted at the McDonald’s and the sometimes unusual steps police officers took in collecting evidence critical to tying him to the crime.Mangione’s lawyers argue the items should be excluded because police did not have a search warrant and lacked the grounds to justify a warrantless search. Prosecutors contend the search was legal and that police eventually obtained a warrant.Wasser, testifying in full uniform, said Altoona police protocols require promptly searching a suspect’s property at the time of an arrest, in part for dangerous items.On body-worn camera video played in court, Wasser was heard saying she wanted to check the bag for bombs before removing it from the McDonald’s. Despite that concern, she acknowledged in her testimony Monday that police never cleared the restaurant of customers or employees.Mangione, 27, has pleaded not guilty to state and federal murder charges. He appeared in good health on Monday, pumping his fist for photographers and chatting with his lawyers as testimony resumed.The hearing, which was postponed on Friday because of Mangione’s apparent illness, applies only to the state case. His lawyers are making a similar push to exclude the evidence from his federal case, where prosecutors are seeking the death penalty.Prosecutors have said the handgun found in the backpack matches the firearm used in the killing and that writings in the notebook showed Mangione’s disdain for health insurers and ideas about killing a CEO at an investor conference.Thompson, 50, was killed as he walked to a Manhattan hotel for his company’s investor conference. Surveillance video showed a masked gunman shooting him from behind. Police have said “delay,” “deny” and “depose” were written on the ammunition, mimicking a phrase used to describe how insurers avoid paying claims.Mangione was arrested in Altoona, about 230 miles from Manhattan, after police there received a 911 call.Wasser testified that she went to the McDonald’s on her own to assist another officer, Joseph Detwiler. Before that, she said, she had seen some coverage of Thompson’s killing on Fox News.Wasser began searching Mangione’s bag as officers took him into custody on initial charges of forgery and false identification, after he acknowledged giving them a bogus driving license, police said. The same fake name was used by the alleged gunman used at a Manhattan hostel days before the shooting.By then, a handcuffed Mangione had been informed of his right to remain silent – and invoked it – when asked if there was anything officers should be concerned about.Wasser told another officer she wanted to check the bag for a bomb before leaving the McDonald’s because she didn’t want to repeat an incident in which another Altoona officer had inadvertently brought a bomb to the police station.“Did you call the bomb squad?” Mangione lawyer Karen Friedman Agnifilo asked.“No. I didn’t find a bomb yet,” Wasser said.According to body-worn camera video, the first few items Wasser found were innocuous: a hoagie, a loaf of bread and a smaller bag containing a passport, cellphone and computer chip.Then she pulled out a gray pair of underwear, unwrapping them to reveal the magazine.Satisfied there was no bomb, she suspended her search and placed some of the items back in the bag. Some evidence, including Mangione’s laptop, was transported to the police station in a brown paper bag, body-worn camera video showed.Wasser resumed her search after an 11-minute drive to the police station and almost immediately found the gun and silencer — the latter discovery prompting her to laugh and exclaim “nice”, according to footage. Wasser said the gun was in a side pocket that she had not searched at McDonald’s. Later, while cataloging everything in the bag, she found the notebook.“Isn’t it awesome?” Wasser said at one point during the search.Asked to explain, she told Friedman Agnifilo that she was proud of her police department’s work in helping to capture Thompson’s suspected killer.A Blair county, Pennsylvania, prosecutor testified that a judge later signed off on a search warrant for the bag, a few hours after the searches were completed. The warrant, she said, provided a legal mechanism for Altoona police to turn the evidence over to New York detectives.As he has throughout the case, assistant district attorney Joel Seidemann described Thompson’s killing as an “execution” and referred to his notebook as a “manifesto” – terms that Mangione’s lawyers said were prejudicial and inappropriate.Judge Gregory Carro said the wording had “no bearing” on him, but warned Seidemann that he’s “certainly not going to do that at trial” when jurors are present.Explore more on these topicsBrian Thompson shootingNew YorkPennsylvanianewsShareReuse this content"

A screenshot of the post began circulating onRedditlast Thursday and garnered over 500 comments. The post and the account were removed by Instagram by Friday morning, according toJ., the Jewish News of Northern California.The school’s principal, Beth Silbergeld, told the Guardian in a written statement that the social media post was reported to an anonymous tip line on Wednesday evening.She also shared that the school will not be sharing the identities of the students who participated or the disciplinary action taken against them, in accordance with federal laws.“While this incident does not reflect the values of the vast majority of our students and families, the harm it caused is real and must be addressed,” Silbergeld said in the statement. “Many in our community were rightly appalled by the image. This incident is troubling and unacceptable. Professionally, we are committed to learning from this moment and moving forward with greater unity and purpose.”She added: “Our message to the community is clear: this was a disturbing and unacceptable act of antisemitism. Actions that target, demean, or threaten Jewish students have no place on our campuses. CUHSD [Campbell Union High School District] and Branham stand firmly against all forms of hate, discrimination, and intolerance.”Representatives from the Bay Area Jewish Coalition (BAJC), a grassroots organization dedicated to ensuring the safety of Jewish Bay Area residents, shared that the impact of the social media post has reverberated beyond San Jose.“To have children echoing Hitler’s words is frankly just shocking and heartbreaking, and the entire community has been rocked by this,” Tali Klima, a BAJC spokesperson, said. “This bold and premeditated display has really shaken everyone.”Maya Bronicki, BAJC’s education lead, attributed the incident in part to a lack of proper Holocaust education and historical context on hate symbols, such as the swastika. “We have absolute faith that if the district takes actual measures to teach students the right lessons about being inclusive and anti-hate, that Jews are a minority that deserve compassion and understanding and deserve to be equal to everyone else in this education system, then that would be a huge step towards tomorrow’s society,” she said.The school district is planning to work with BAJC, as well as the Anti-Defamation League and the Jewish Community Relations Council of the Bay Area to address and repair harm caused by the incident.Explore more on these topicsCaliforniaWest CoastAntisemitismnewsShareReuse this content"

He found it “particularly shocking” that Le Pen had been barred from running for office, including the 2027 presidency, after she was found guilty ofembezzlement of European parliament funds on a vast scaleearlier this year.Le Pen will face an appeal trial next month, which will determine whether or not she can run for president in 2027 or whether her party president, Jordan Bardella, will replace her.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Despite being responsible for some of the films widely acknowledged to be the best of the century so far, including There Will Be Blood, The Master and Phantom Thread, the writer-director is yet to win an Oscar, Golden Globe or more than one Bafta (original screenplay for 2021’s Licorice Pizza).This year’s Golden Globe nominations suggest this is about to change, with his counterculture epicOne Battle After Anotherleading the pack of nominees with nine mentions on the shortlist, including for best comedy or musical, best director, best original screenplay, leading actor for Leonardo DiCaprio, leading actor for Chase Infiniti, supporting actress for Teyana Taylor and two chances to scoop supporting actor – for Sean Penn and Benicio del Toro. Jonny Greenwood’s score was also recognised.Golden Globes 2026: full list of nominationsRead moreAnderson, 55, has been here before, of course – he already has 11 Oscar nominations, one of the highest totals for someone who is yet to win – yet the season so far indicatesOne Battle After Another, in which DiCaprio plays a flailing freedom fighter facing off against Penn’s white supremacist, is the film to beat. Last week it won both the Gotham awards and New York Film Critics Circle, while on Sunday it also triumphed at the Los Angeles Film Critics Association awards.The film best placed to manage an upset seems set to beSinners, Ryan Coogler’s Mississippi-set ghost thriller which reunites him with Fruitvale Station and Creed star Michael B Jordan and was a major box office hit when it opened last spring. Sinners took seven Globe nominations, including best drama, director and actor. Coogler made history in 2018, when his Marvel film, Black Panther, took $1.3bn – the most grossed by a film directed by an African American man – and became the first superhero film to be nominated for best picture.View image in fullscreenRyan Coogler, Lupita Nyong’o and Michael B Jordan at a screening of Sinners in New York in December.Photograph: Theo Wargo/Getty ImagesNo Black director has yet won either the main Golden Globe or Academy Award for best director, although several – including Steve McQueen and Barry Jenkins – have directed films that have won best picture.Both Sinners and One Battle After Another are made by the studio Warner Bros, now the subject of aproposed buyout by Netflix. Although any deal is unlikely to go through by mid January, when the Globes take place, if it completes by 15 March it would bolster the streaming company’s chances of securing their first, and highly coveted, best picture win.Joachim Trier’sSentimental Valueperformed considerably better than expected, with eight nominations including best female actor for Renate Reinsve, and supporting female actor for both Inga Ibsdotter Lilleaas and Elle Fanning, supporting male actor for Stellan Skarsgård, plus recognition for the film’s original screenplay and direction.View image in fullscreenRenate Reinsve (left) and Inga Ibsdotter Lilleaas in Sentimental Value.Photograph: Kasper Tuxen/APIt is one of six contenders for best non-English language motion picture, including Iranian director Jafar Panahi’sIt Was Just an Accident. The Palme d’Or winner was put forward by France for the award as its director – whose experiences in prison inspired the film – is out of favour with his country’s government, whichlast week sentenced him to a further year in prison. His film is also up for best drama, best screenplay and best director.The healthy showing for both films, as well as for Park Chan-wook’sNo Other Choiceand Kleber Mendonça Filho’sThe Secret Agent– each of which picked up three nominations – are testament to both the Globes’ uptick in internationalism and a year in cinema that has been relatively soft for Hollywood critical hits while non-English language films have thrived.Wagner Moura’s nomination for best male actor in a drama, for The Secret Agent, makes him the first Brazilian to compete in the category, while actors such as Brendan Fraser (Rental Family) and Robert Pattinson (Die My Love) were excluded. Australian Joel Edgerton was among the nominees for the critically acclaimed Train Dreams.Richard Linklater and Emma Thompson are up for most surprising snub in the 2026 Golden Globe nominations | Peter BradshawRead moreOther significant snubs include Kathryn Bigelow, whose nuclear thrillerA House of Dynamitefailed to pick up a single nomination despite its rapturous reception at the Venice film festival; Alex Garland’sWarfare; and the highly acclaimed Taiwanese filmLeft-Handed Girl, written and directed by Tsou Shih-Ching, the longterm collaborator of Sean Baker, whose Anora swept the Oscars earlier this year.Sydney Sweeney’s committedperformance as boxer Christy Martinalso failed to translate to an expected nomination, while Bradley Cooper’s standup dramedyIs This Thing On?also failed to land any names in the hat.A number of hopefuls also only scored a single nomination for their stars, including Song Sung Blue (Kate Hudson), Springsteen biopic Deliver Me from Nowhere (Jeremy Allen White), Shaker story The Testament of Ann Lee (Amanda Seyfried), Luca Guadagnino’s After the Hunt (Julia Roberts) and Lynne Ramsay’s Die My Love (Jennifer Lawrence).There was also some confusion among pundits as to howSuperman(total takings: $616m) failed to land a cinematic and box office achievement mention, whileKPop Demon Hunters– released on Netflix with a brief singalong release – did.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFilm WeeklyFree newsletterTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Gwyneth Paltrow missed out on a supporting actress nomination for a performance many perceived as her career comeback.Chalamet, who turns 30 later this month, is perceived by many to have been last season’s runner-up in the best actor race, with his turn as Bob Dylan in A Complete Unknown losing every award save the Screen Actors Guild prize to The Brutalist’s Adrien Brody.WithWicked: For Good, Jon M Chu bested the four nominations earned last year by his first instalment, taking five nods, including best comedy or musical, best actress for Cynthia Erivo and best supporting actress for Ariana Grande. Erivo’s nod makes her the first Black woman to be nominated twice in that category.View image in fullscreenOwen Cooper with his Emmy for Adolescence, September 2025.Photograph: Frederic J Brown/AFP/Getty ImagesThis year’s TV nominations were dominated by HBO/Sky’s envelope-pushing dramaThe White Lotusand Netflix’s audacious single-shot seriesAdolescence, which took six and five nominations respectively.Stephen Graham, Ashley Walters, Owen Cooper and Erin Doherty are all up for acting awards for Adolescence, while the show will compete against All Her Fault, The Beast in Me, Black Mirror, Dying for Sex and The Girlfriend for best limited series.The White Lotus, meanwhile, scores nods for Walton Goggins, Jason Isaacs, Carrie Coon, Parker Posey, Aimee Lou Wood, as well as for best drama series.Previously announced were the winners of the lifetime achievement awards, Helen Mirren and Sarah Jessica Parker who will receive the Cecil B DeMille and Carol Burnett awards, respectively, at a ceremony on 8 January.Last year’s best filmGolden Globeswere won by The Brutalist and Emilia Pérez for drama and musical/comedy respectively, while the lead acting prizes were taken by Brody, Demi Moore, Fernanda Torres and Sebastian Stan.

Many joined the queue without having the right planning permissions or financing in place to move the project forward, leaving “shovel-ready” projects stuck in the backlog.Almost twice as many battery projects were rejected from the queue as were fast-tracked by the system operator, according to Neso’s figures, which do not include projects that had already voluntarily left the queue.Chris Stark, the head of the government’s 2030 clean power taskforce, said: “Queueing is a very British tradition, but the queue to connect to Britain’s grid has held back our economy.“This overhaul of the connections process is the single-most important step we will take towards a clean power system. The energy projects our country needs now have the green light to deploy at a pace we haven’t seen for decades. This unlocks the modern, clean energy system Britain needs for 2030 and beyond.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Only 3% of the capacity due to connect by 2030 will be gas-fired power, it said.The system operator has also reserved capacity for projects including datacentres and other energy-hungry schemes to connect to the grid. However, these projects face fewer requirements to prove that they will move ahead.Separately, Monday marks 25 years of offshore wind power generation in the UK since the first turbines were erected at Blyth off the coast of Northumberland. Britain’s 47 operational offshore windfarms now supply nearly a fifth (17%) of its electricity generation – making it the second-biggest power source after gas – with the sector employing about 40,000 people, according to an analysis released on Monday by green group Ember.This article was amended on 8 December 2025. An earlier version said it was 25 years since the UK’s first wind turbines were erected; in fact, it is 25 years since the UK’s first offshore wind farm was installed.Explore more on these topicsEnergy industryEnergyRenewable energyNational GridEd MilibandEnergy storageEnergy efficiencynewsShareReuse this content"

Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS), the advisory group, recommended investors vote in favour of the merger, but said “the linking of variable incentives to the completion of transactions is not considered good practice” and that the high proposed payout “undermines the other performance criteria”.Anglo said it would now engage further with investors over director pay before its AGM next year.The U-turn comes just a day before investors in Anglo and Teck vote on the proposed merger, which if approved wouldform one of the biggest copper producers in the world.The deal emerged after Wanblad fought off a series of takeover attempts by its larger rival BHP last year, pushing it to radically restructure the group, including seeking the sale of its famous diamonds business, De Beers.Anglo, which was founded in 1917 by the entrepreneur Ernest Oppenheimer and alsoowns the troubled Woodsmith fertiliser mine project in North Yorkshire, rebuffed the £39bn takeover from BHP while Teck rejected an offer from Glencore in 2023 for £16.6bn.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

What Netflix hopes to achieve by buying Warner Bros | Andrew PulverRead moreNetflix emerged as thewinner of the Warner Bros Discovery auctionon Friday, beating rivals Paramount Skydance and Comcast.There are concerns that combining Warner’s HBO Max streaming service with Netflix could put the company over the 30% market share threshold in the US.However, it is understood that Netflix disputes this figure. It is expected to argue that other streaming services such asYouTubeshould also be considered in the media landscape.Netflix accounts for 8% of total TV viewing time in the US, according to the research firm Nielsen, putting it behind the likes of YouTube, Disney and Paramount.The Warner Brothers deal would give Netflix control of the studio behind franchises including Harry Potter, Batman and Superman, as well asHBO, home to shows including Game of Thrones, The White Lotus and Succession.At anevent at theJohn F Kennedy Centerin the US capital, Trump said Netflix had a “very big market share” that would “go up by a lot” if the deal went ahead.Many industry voices,including Hollywood unions, have argued the deal should be blocked.The Netflix-Warner merger is not expected to be completed until the third quarter of 2026 or later, and will be subject to regulatory approval in the US and in Europe. It is also expected to be reviewed by the Department of Justice.Trump said Netflix’s co-chief executive Ted Sarandos visited the Oval Office recently, and praised him for his work at the company. “I have a lot of respect for him. He’s a great person,” the president said. “He’s done one of the greatest jobs in the history of movies.”Before the deal, reports suggested that Trump preferredParamount to win the Warner Brothers takeoverbecause it is backed by Larry Ellison, the billionaire co-founder of the tech company Oracle and a Trump supporter.

He wants to resurrect the glitz and glamour of the US film industry, whose star has faded as more productions are made overseas, thanks to tax incentives and cheaper costs.“Netflix will be under pressure to do as much as possible on home soil, so any commitment to do a certain amount of production in the US could help to win Trump over.”Netflix declined to comment.Explore more on these topicsNetflixWarner BrosMergers, acquisitions and fundingMergers and acquisitionsTechnology sectorTV streamingTelevision industrynewsShareReuse this content"

His photograph showed a youngster in the slums of the Gorbals wearing a dirtied dress. Smiling and holding a cane, she stands next to a young woman who is wearing a dress patterned with the faces of the Fab Four.View image in fullscreenAn enduring image … Beatle Girl by Joseph McKenzie.Images like McKenzie’s, and the street photography of Oscar Marzaroli, came to define Glasgow’s distinctive character – its Victorian tenements, grit and hardiness – charting industrial boom and subsequent bust, cycles of dereliction, regeneration and demolition. But what happened next? Featuring 80 photographs by artists of different generations,Still Glasgow, at the city’s Gallery of Modern Art (GoMA), captures its changes and complexities through the eyes of people who have been there since the 1940s.The show tracks music, art, activism and football – and local traditions, such as “Gobstopper”. This was immortalised inRoderick Buchanan’s 2000 video, in which two teens try to hold their breath for as long as possible while passing through the Clyde Tunnel. Here, some of the artists included in Still Glasgow explain what the city means to them.‘The lights blew the minute Franz Ferdinand started playing’Alan DimmickView image in fullscreen‘Down to earth, no airs and graces’ … Franz Ferdinand, The Captain’s Rest, Glasgow by Alan DimmickGlasgow’s music scene has always been lo-fi, DIY, small venues. It’s not fancy. It’s down to earth, no airs and graces. This was a secret Franz Ferdinand gig for an album that wasn’t out yet, in the basement of The Captain’s Rest, a tiny pub that’s been around a long time. Loads of people were outside trying to get in, but the room was full with 30 to 40 people. Within a minute of the gig starting, the electricity fused and you couldn’t see a thing. Eventually it got going again, though it blew several more times.‘I don’t know who they are. Their names were lost in a fire’David EustaceView image in fullscreen‘These strangers played an important part in my life’ … Man on Monocycle, Man with Stilts by David EustaceI wanted to record a time of great change in the city – and in the street musicians and performers I passed daily in the early 1990s. As a recent graduate with few funds, I came across an old, abandoned warehouse near the River Clyde and set about plastering and painting a wall that would serve as a studio backdrop. I would approach street entertainers who not only stopped what they were doing – ie, earning a living – but actually followed me to this dilapidated studio in a quiet part of the city.Unfortunately this was pre-computers, and the sitter’s names were noted on paper documents that were lost in a fire. Thankfully I can still remember some. The series of fibre-based silver prints in the exhibition were printed in my darkroom. These strangers, The Buskers, have played an important part in my life and, beyond simply photography and career, have brought opportunities I could never have imagined when I first sought the help of those strangers.‘I took 330 shots of the flats just before their demolition’Iseult TimmermansView image in fullscreen‘I decided to capture my experience’ … 10 Red Road Flats by Iseult Timmermans.I came to Glasgow in 1990. It was really weird. I felt I had come home. I’ve worked withStreet Level Photoworks, Glasgow’s first photography gallery, for 35 years. In 1990, I ran a project with Kosovan refugees, and on the last day of the six-week project, one of the girls was telling me about her experiences of the war under the safelight in the darkroom. Afterwards I drove her home to the Red Road flats. I had never heard of them. They were famously the tallest residential buildings in the UK when they were built: a vision of Brutalist utopian living, spectacular architecturally but alien, terrifying and disorienting.In those days, one block was a processing centre for asylum seekers coming to Glasgow. It was like a massive shabby hotel. I ended up running a community photography programme there, in a flat at 10 Red Road Court, for 10 years. It had a terrible reputation but I had nothing but great experiences. Coverage of the Red Road flats was always negative, so I decided to capture my experience of being there.I did it very literally: I photographed every floor, every landing, every view out, just before the demolition. Only half a dozen families were left by then. I made 330 images. No one else has captured the flats like that, with an inside view. I first exhibited some in 2014, just before the flats finally came down. The show didn’t just give a unique view of iconic architecture that is no longer there, it also touched on Glasgow’s history of housing developments and its welcoming of asylum seekers.‘I had to wear an alarm in case I got in trouble’Jane Evelyn AtwoodView image in fullscreen‘They were out of it by 10 in the morning’ … Man Standing in Entrance to Great Eastern Hotel by Jane Evelyn AtwoodWhen I took photographs at the Great Eastern Hotel for an assignment in 1994, I had to wear an alarm, in case I got into trouble with the guys living there. But nothing ever happened. The Great Eastern used to be a beautiful, luxurious hotel, then it became a flophouse where people were supposed to spend a couple of nights and move on – but many spent a long time there. I met some who had been there 20 years.It was completely run down. There had been a fire a long time before. They had swept the cinders up – but nothing more. It was a hostel for the homeless when I went, but the upstairs rooms weren’t really rooms: the partitions didn’t go up to the ceiling, so you could hear everything, and the doors had fallen off.I’m American originally and I couldn’t understand what anyone said. Although they were nice to me, the alcoholism was terrible. They drank so much they were out of it by 10 in the morning. They had been abandoned. There was no therapy of any kind. They were just left to their own devices. I went back a long time afterwards, when renovation was beginning, and all that was left was one pillar. It made me sad, wondering where all the people ended up.‘Being part of this scene was very cool’Joanne Tatham and Tom O’SullivanView image in fullscreen‘Each frame is made of found plywood’ … Easels by Joanne Tatham and Tom O’Sullivan.We lived and worked in Glasgow from the 1990s until 2011. At that time, the city was a place of real creativity – and change. We were interested in what was happening, but also the stories that emerged. This work, Easels, shows 15 artists in their studios. Each frame in the grid is made of found plywood.In the 1990s, narratives around gentrification in Glasgow didn’t align with other places. A lot of these grassroots spaces, such as Grey Wolf Studios and Wasps Studios, were set up in the 1970s and were well established. They were seen as part of civic culture. Although they weren’t glitzy, they were funded and were part of the ecology. In 2016, we took a number of trips back to make this work and had a great time. It’s a playful portrait capturing the feeling of a scene, but also the love of that scene and the mythology of it. Being part of it all was very cool.‘We asked people:what’s Glasgow to you?’Madelon HooykaasView image in fullscreenA Jaguar and a horse-and-cart shot by Madelon Hooykaas.Photograph: Stansfield/ HooykaasIn 1975, Third Eye Gallery, now the CCA, acquired a Portapak, the first portable video recording device, and they invited the late Scottish artist Elsa Stansfield and I to make a work with it. We created a studio people could come to, recording their responses to questions along the lines of: “What’s Glasgow to you?” People got involved. They could walk in and feel heard. It was the first time something like that had been done inScotland. The video has now been lost, but the photographs connected to it survive.‘This is Charlie Prodger before she won the Turner’Matthew Arthur WilliamsView image in fullscreen‘I want people to feel comfortable’ … Charlie Prodger by Matthew Arthur Williams.I’ve been in Glasgow for 12 years. It’s become home and I have no intentions of moving. I have been taking portraits of artists for GoMA for six years. I usually do the portrait at their studio or home. I want people to feel comfortable with how they’re represented.My work at GoMA is of the artist Charlie Prodger, before she won the Turner prize in 2018. It’s encouraging when you see friends and peers doing so well. It was a freezing day but sunny and bright, and we were in her flat. Charlie and I have worked together and helped each other. Glasgow has a tight-knit community of artists who are always working together – we survive by sharing resources and making space for each other. The art community is thriving here because of that. The situation in Glasgow is different to other places: funding is difficult, there’s a lack of money in the arts, conditions are fraught, so you have to make something out of nothing.‘My shot is a reminder of fun times with my family’Khansa AslamView image in fullscreenChildren Playing on Roundabout in Maxwell Park by Eric Watt.Photograph: Eric Watt/© Glasgow Life Museums collectionIn May 2023, some of us from the Glendale Women’s Cafe went to see Coming Into View, an exhibition of Eric Watt’s photographs of Glasgow.

I was born and raised around there in the 1980s and 90s.View image in fullscreen‘My Asian roots are an important part of who I am’ … Family on the Roundabout by Khansa Aslam.In my photograph of Maxwell Park, I wanted to capture the place’s changes and similarities.

I value how generations of people from many backgrounds have made Glasgow their home. My children grew up here and they proudly call this city home too.‘Things perked up in the 1980s as pride in the city grew’Keith InghamView image in fullscreen‘1970s weren’t good, there were strikes and unemployment’ … Untitled by Keith Ingham.I moved to Glasgow 50 years ago but I’m still identified as English. It’s that sort of place. I was living in the West End and would go to the public library frequently to change my book – a nice purpose-built Victorian building. One Saturday, I walked in and it was full of amazing photographs – what became known as the social documentary genre – of the local area: Partick, near the River Clyde, a working-class area where the shipbuilding industry used to be. I got in touch with the Partick Camera Club, which had created the exhibition. I was invited to do a project about the demolition and rejuvenation of the East End. My shots were first shown at The People’s Palace and seen by thousands.That’s when I started to get serious about photography. I’ve never made any money from it, but I have enthusiasm and people know about me. The 1970s weren’t good – the shipyards closed, there were strikes and unemployment, a lot of anger and anxiety. It perked up in the 1980s, and there began to be pride in the city and being Glaswegian. There was a huge garden festival and, in 1990, Glasgow was European City of Culture, which was a huge thing and generated an international reputation. It’s changed enormously.Still Glasgowis at GoMA until 13 June 2027Explore more on these topicsPhotographyGlasgowScotlandfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Perhaps it was creator Jacob Tierney’sterse response to questions of his leading actors’ sexualitieswhile on a recent promotional tour. Or that the show is based on a series of concupiscent novels by Canadian writer Rachel Reid that centre hockey (!), and which ride the current trend for “hate-to-love” romance driving the kids crazy. Actually, it’s probably just all the hot gay sex.Because Heated Rivalry does get heated. One minute aloof Russian player Ilya Rozanov (Connor Storrie) is making eyes at meek local champion Shane Hollander (Hudson Williams), the next they’re wanking in the shower together. Then getting blowjobs in classy hotel suites. Pretty soon, the boys are going at it hammer and tongs – broken at regular intervals by months-long ellipses, waiting for the hockey circuit to bring them back into each others’ arms. This is also convenient for sexual tension, which would otherwise have to be developed through character and dialogue.So much heat. If only they had somewhere they could cool down.Actually, for a show ostensibly about ice hockey – a sport that lends itself to rousing storytelling, asInside Out 2beautifully demonstrated – there’s curiously little of it on display here. Tierney seems more interested in the ambivalent thrill of down-low fucking than any exploration of masculinity or homoeroticism in sport. The guys don’t even use their uniforms when having sex – which I find highly improbable.The sex scenes aren’t quite as explicit as the pearl-clutching critics might have you believe, although they seem to provide a valuable cardio workout to augment the boys’ training (they make the sweaty scenes from Challengers look like dry humping). The problem is the actors’ ludicrously sculpted bodies resemble store mannequins dipped in vats of lube, and the rigorous on-set intimacy coordinators seem to have sucked all the spontaneity from the action, so the effect has the strange waxiness you get in a Bret Easton Ellis novel without his concomitant satirical savagery. It brings to mind the puppets fucking in Team America: World Police.When they’re not boning each other senseless, Rozanov and Hollander make for dreary, monosyllabic company – and their stormy sex life hardly constitutes “hate-to-love” romance, given they’re in the sack within the opening 10 minutes and actively encourage each other’s careers.View image in fullscreen‘When they’re not boning each other senseless, Rozanov and Hollander make for dreary, monosyllabic company.’Photograph: HBO MaxPerhaps in acknowledgment of this lack of dramatic material, the third episode ignores the central couple altogether to focus on a teammate, fellow closeted gay Scott Hunter (François Arnaud) and his dalliance with local barista Kip (Robbie GK). Yes, every single professional ice hockey player in the world is secretly, torturously gay (but also totally up for it).The Outsiders: why Francis Ford Coppola’s coming-of-age drama is secretly gayRead moreIf only this love affair were more interesting than the previous one, or at least had some thematic consequence. Alas, Scott and Kip (Skip?) are saddled with a tedious, emotionally remote story arc and dialogue so banal (“I want you more than I’ve ever wanted anything in a long time”), the whole episode starts to feel like an unfortunate detour, skippable.Performances are generally wooden, which might suit the taciturn nature of professional sportspeople but creates a drag on pace and mood. The key exception is Storrie as the mercurial Russian – who steals the third episode with 20 seconds of screen time – bursting with charisma, machismo and brawn, but also something sad and wounded. He’s too good for the material, and could use a stronger sparring partner, who is easily mistaken for his hockey stick.View image in fullscreen‘He’s too good for the material’ …  Connor Storrie as Ilya Rozanov.Photograph: Sabrina Lantos/HBO MaxWe’re only halfway through, but I already get a sinking feeling about Heated Rivalry. It comes out of a wave of gay-themed romcom material – fromHeartstoppertoRed, White and Royal Blue– that seems content to exploit gay culture without understanding it in a meaningful way. There is a weird kind of fetish in these works that desexes gay men just enough to make them palatable, like pets for young women (and it’s largely young women reading these books and driving sales).Heated Rivalry might have raunchier sex than its rivals – not difficult in Heartstopper’s case, where no one has even heard of a blowjob – but it trades in the same bullshit platitudes and cheap stereotypes about gay men as they do. Maybe it matters less that Tierney’s actors could be straight than the cosplay going on in the source material. The show may help you get your rocks off, but will it respect you in the morning?Heated Rivalry is airing weekly onHBOMax in Australia and US now, with a UK release date yet to be announced.Explore more on these topicsDramaTelevisionHBOLGBTQ+ rightsreviewsShareReuse this content"

Finishing Cover-Up, a film about his astonishing life and countless scoops, was never going to be easyXan BrooksMon 8 Dec 2025 00.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 8 Dec 2025 20.04 ESTShareOne morning last month, Seymour Hersh set off to buy a newspaper. The reporter walked for 30 minutes, covered six blocks of his neighbourhood, Georgetown in Washington DC, and didn’t see a single sign of life. No newsstands on street corners selling the glossies and the dailies. No self-service kiosk where you can slide in a dollar and pull out a paper. “Finally, I found a drugstore that had two copies of theNew York Timesin the back,” Hersh recalls. He bought one for himself. He can’t help but wonder whether anybody bought the second.Hersh was born in Chicago in 1937, the year the Hindenburg airship blew up and the aviator Amelia Earhart disappeared over the Pacific. That makes him a man of hot metal, the media’s ancient mariner, with metaphorical newsprint on his fingers and a cuttings file that reads like an index of American misadventure. Hersh has been a staff writer at the New York Times and the New Yorker. He’s broken stories on Vietnam, Watergate, Gaza and Ukraine. But the free press is in crisis, newspapers are in flux and investigative journalism may be facing a deadline of its own. “I don’t think I could do now what I did 30, 40, 50 years ago,” says the now 88-year-old. “The outlets aren’t there. The money’s not there. So I don’t know where we all are right now.”Laura, the director, would ask me, ‘And how did you feel?’ That’s not a guy’s questionCover-Up, a new documentary from Laura Poitras and Mark Obenhaus, at least reminds us where he’s been, rewinding the clock to chart Hersh’s galvanic, obstreperous course through American journalism. It’s a film that gives us the newsman’s greatest hits, with particular focus on his exposés of the 1968 My Lai massacre of unarmed South Vietnamese civilians by US army soldiers, and the 2004 Abu Ghraib prison torture scandal, while also acknowledging his occasional missteps and contentious reliance on unnamed single sources.View image in fullscreen‘His anger was mostly directed at me’ … Oscar-winning documentary-maker Laura Poitras.Photograph: Linda Nylind/The GuardianAlong the way, it whips up a vivid sketch of Hersh himself: a prickly hothead who makes enemies in the editorial office and the Oval Office alike. “This Seymour Hersh is a son of a bitch, probably a communist agent,” President Nixon tells Kissinger on an unearthed White House tape. “But,” he adds grudgingly, “he’s usually right.”Initially, Hersh had no interest in participating in the documentary. He says Poitras chased him for years. He’s still not sure what made him change his mind. Hersh had collaborated with Obenhaus several times in the past. But Poitras was a different kind of director and came at him from disconcerting new angles. “Mark and I, when we interview people, we just ask them what happened. Whereas Laura would ask me, ‘And how did you feel?’” He snorts at the memory. “That’s not a guy’s question. That’s more psychoanalytical.”The shoot was a chore and his patience ran short. Hersh hated letting cameras snoop around his office, which was heaped with legal notepads and Rolodexes. He guarded his list of contacts like a dragon guards its treasure. It was only a matter of time before his mistrust boiled over and he threatened to quit the film altogether.Poitras won an Oscar for Citizenfour, her documentary on the NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden, whose revelations were published in the Guardian. Her previous picture,All the Beauty and the Bloodshed, about the artist and activist Nan Goldin, won the Venice Golden Lion. So she’s used to working with volatile subjects to the point where she relishes the drama they bring. Her main thought, when Hersh briefly bailed on the project, was a sense of relief that he had considerately done so on-camera.View image in fullscreenFrontline … an image from Cover-Up of US troopsin Vietnam.Photograph: Ron Haeberle/Courtesy of Netflix“Sy has a pattern of quitting,” Poitras tells me. “He quit the New York Times, for instance. So we knew it wasn’t inconceivable that he would quit the movie. It could well have happened. But I thought he was invested, I thought we’d get through it. His anger was mostly directed at me. We hit a small bump. He quit the movie. But 24 hours later he was back.”The film is about Hersh but it’s also about journalism. It shows the news media’s in-built contradictions and its flawed business model. Cover-Up suggests that the best investigative reporters are natural outsiders who rarely last long inside risk-averse institutions. Editors and management might claim they want good stories, but in practice they fear them, because scoops tend to cause trouble and involve a big fight. Tellingly, the film includes an archive clip of Hersh speaking on stage in the 1970s. He says: “What we have here in America is not so much censorship as self-censorship by the press.”If that was true then, Poitras says, it’s doubly so today. She’s alarmed not just by Trump’s authoritarian push to stifle a free press but by the alacrity with which several media giants have already rolled over. Two major networks – ABC and CBS – recently agreed to settlements with Trump instead of fighting the case out in court. The Washington Post’s owner, Jeff Bezos, has ordered the paper to focus less on politics and more on promoting “personal liberties and free markets”.The situation is parlous, Poitras says. “What we’re seeing in the US is the preemptive capitulation of institutions to avoid a legal battle they would have won. That’s shameful. I don’t know how they explain that to themselves. It’s the worst precedent you can possibly set.” She shakes her head. “If institutions aren’t willing to back aggressive reporting, it’s dangerous. We all suffer.”View image in fullscreenShocked by the crowd’s response … Poitras and Hersh at the Venice film festival in August.Photograph: Yara Nardi/ReutersTimes are tough, agrees Obenhaus, Cover-Up’s co-director. The first amendment is under daily siege; it’s the closest to McCarthyism, the era of repression and persecution in the 1950s, that he has witnessed in his lifetime. Throw in the wider issue of an increasingly atomised media landscape and it might amount to the perfect storm.“There are no gatekeepers on information any more,” says Obenhaus. “The so-called legacy media is so dispersed. And without that centre – that base – it’s hard for good journalism to break through, which means people are increasingly relying on unreliable sources. It troubles me tremendously that the Sy Hersh of today might be writing on Substack or some other platform – and you’d never even hear of them unless the algorithm connected you to their work.”As it happens,Hersh does write on Substack. The platform suits him because he has a large dedicated readership that will happily pay for his work; also because it allows him to cover the stories he wants, free from editorial interference. “Substack is self-publishing,” Hersh explains. “So it’s a subculture. It works financially. It’s a living, I’m not knocking it. But it’s not like writing for the New York Times.” He doesn’t miss the office politics, the corporate culture and what he sees as the cowardice and compliance of senior editors. What he misses, though, is the thrill of performing on the big stage.If Cover-Up shows us anything, it’s that the journalist’s role has always been sisyphean. It’s a constant uphill struggle in which every triumph risks being immediately rolled back. Hersh’s career-making exposé of the My Lai massacre, for instance, dismantled the US army’s official version of events and helped swing public opinion against the war in Vietnam. But it led to the conviction of only one out of the 26 soldiers involved,Lieutenant William Calley, whose prison sentence was later commuted by Nixon.One bonus of a six-decade career is that it gives Hersh a sense of perspective. Investigative reporting is usually thankless and frequently fruitless, he knows. But it still speaks truth to power and remains a vital engine of social change. “The principle of journalism is incredible,” he says. “Just imagine how the world would have been if we didn’t have the journalism we’ve had, and still have today. I don’t like what’s going on in the US. I don’t like the kowtowing to Trump. But there’s still the Wall Street Journal. The New York Times is still a good newspaper. The LA Times used to be but it’s now owned by a Trumpist.” He is referring to Patrick Soon-Shiong. “But journalism matters,” he adds, collecting himself. “It’s necessary.”Cover-Up review – Laura Poitras’s Seymour Hersh documentary is a thrilling ode to journalismRead moreIn September, Hersh attended the Cover-Up premiere at the Venice film festival. The audience response was so overwhelming, Poitras says, that it moved the newsman to tears. “He’s always been this lone-wolf troublemaker,” she explains. “So maybe he’s not used to being recognised and celebrated. I don’t think he was prepared for it. He was very emotional. He was crying.”Hersh tells a different story. He claims he was shocked by the crowd’s response. The audience didn’t get the film’s humour, he adds, didn’t laugh at the right moments, then applauded for an unseemly amount of time at the end. “I was embarrassed by that,” he says. “I know they like to measure the length of the applause at these festivals, but come on, enough. I was trying to stop it.”I like the image of Hersh standing in the aisle and signalling for people to shut up. It feels neatly on-brand for this most awkward of customers: a thorn in the side of every great institution – an unashamed party-pooper, even at his own party.Cover-Up is in UK and Irish cinemas from 5 December, and on Netflix from 26 December.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsLaura PoitrasNew York TimesNewspapersUS press and publishingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Fresh out of juvenile prison, 18-year-old Wellington (João Pedro Mariano) finds himself at a crossroads; abandoned by his parents, the wide-eyed young man finds solace in the arms of others. On an evening out with his rowdy group of queer and non-binary friends, Wellington crosses paths with Ronaldo (Ricardo Teodoro), a hunky, charismatic hustler more than twice his age. Bathed in the flickering glow of a neon-lit porn cinema, their first meeting is sensuous and erotic, with an edge of danger. Ronaldo quickly introduces Wellington to the shadowy world of sex work and drug dealing.Caetano depicts Wellington’s new life of crime with tender empathy rather than as a sensationalist cautionary tale. Now going by the name of Baby, he approaches his transactional encounters with cocky bravado and touching naivety. To his customers, Wellington lends not only his youth and his body, but also moments of care. In the feverish excitement of São Paulo, filled with bustling alleyways and colourful shopfronts, there’s a gnawing loneliness, as unmoored souls cling on to one another for momentary bliss.Ronaldo is both a lover and a protective father figure to Wellington, but their relationship is derailed by jealousy and economic precarity. Threats from shady figures in the underworld pale in comparison to the fear of state surveillance and incarceration, represented by the hovering figures of police officers on patrol. Baby is most powerful as an astute portrait of the lost people who have fallen through the cracks of the system. The streets might be fraught with peril, yet they are where they can find their own family, too.● Baby is in UK cinemas from 12 December.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsBrazilSex workAmericasreviewsShareReuse this content"

A dozen cheerleaders scream “I’m sexy, I’m cute, I’m popular to boot” in unison – and I have yet to meet anyone (and I have tried) who has the willpower to look away.It’s certainly not an exaggeration to say I wanted to be one of them – that is, one of the Toros, Rancho Carne high school’s premier cheer squad. But, as a six-year-old watching in north London, I was a world away from the cornucopia of herkies, suggestive dance moves and hair flips of competitive cheerleading in San Diego.For the uninitiated (and those who have yet to watch me watch them enjoy this gift of a film), the Toros are the reigning champions of the high school cheer world, with five national championships under their belt, ready to clinch a sixth. Their outgoing captain, the unrelentingly cruel and self-satisfied “Big Red”, passes the baton to Torrance (Kirsten Dunst), the bright-eyed, callow but obsessive new leader whose ambitious plans include recruiting the jaded new girl and disenchanted former gymnast, Missy (Eliza Dushku).But as a city transplant, skeptical of the San Diego suburbs’ burdensome pep, Missy quickly recognizes her new team’s performance for what it is: a ripped-off, whitewashed version of an all-Black squad’s routine: the East Compton Clovers. Their captain, Isis (played by Gabrielle Union), tells Torrance that her predecessor has been flagrantly stealing their moves for years. “I know you didn’t think a white girl made that shit up,” Isis scolds the Toros. The Clovers are done taking it lying down and plan to win big at nationals, while exposing the Toros as hacks.Shell-shocked that their victories are just rewards for plagiarism, Torrance leads her squad through a cheer intervention in an attempt to learn a truly original routine. She finds an ally in Missy, a love interest in new guy Cliff (played by early aughts mainstay Jesse Bradford), and challenges her team to lose their noxious attitudes. But the real balm of this movie is that our protagonists aren’t rewarded in the slightest. In fact, the Toros lose outright. No hero’s journey, no relief for trying to do the right thing, no actual sense that they’re the good guys. In fact, every time we see the Clovers perform they shine brighter than the Toros.The movie was, in many ways, the first of its kind. It was one of the few films during a rush of teen comedies that spanned from the late 90s to the mid-2000s to actually spotlight cheerleading, while also poking fun at its self-seriousness and apparent vapidity. But it also used the sport as a way to talk about cultural appropriation long before it became common parlance in long reads and college seminars.This may be where Dunst shines brightest in the film: she’s the epitome of a young guilty white woman, always “trying to do the right thing”, but often appearing tone-deaf. When she gets wind that the Clovers might not be able to afford to travel to Florida to compete in the final tournament, she insists that her father’s company sponsor them to ensure they have a chance to compete. Isis rejects the offer, tearing up the check in her face, and assuring Torrance that her squad doesn’t need her “guilt money”. Instead, in a perfectly trite moment in Jessica Bendinger’s otherwise slick script, Isis tells the Toros to “bring it” and not to “slack off” because they might feel guilty for the Clovers. “That way, when we beat you, we’ll know it’s because we’re better,” she says. Released in 2000, in the post-Clueless deluge of movies set in high schools that routinely offered a win for their blond leading ladies, the movie still feels transgressive. For Torrance and her team, second place is what they deserve, and it’s what they get.‘Ingrained in my psyche’: why Gremlins 2: The New Batch is my feelgood movieRead moreIn my frequent rewatches, I’m reminded that the supporting characters offer some of the film’s best performances. Dushku’s quick wit and chronic sarcasm remind you she was woefully undercast throughout her career, while Union sheds the sidekick typecast she endured for earlier performances, commanding each scene as the captain who’s ready to make an example of the team that’s been profiting off her routines. It’s all the more powerful considering this is more than a decade before a social media callout would become a tool for holding people accountable for stealing Black creatives’ work.While there have been several absurd direct-to-video sequels that haven’t captured a modicum of the original film’s camp or audacity, mercifully there aren’t any plans for an actual reboot. There doesn’t seem to be any need to imagine what Torrance is up to now, whether she’s coaching a squad herself, or whether the Clovers won another championship. I’m happy for the story to end the way it does in the movie – with the cast lip-syncing to a cover version of Mickey by Toni Basil as the credits roll.Bring It On is available to rent digitally in the US, on Amazon Prime in the UK and on SBS on Demand in AustraliaExplore more on these topicsFilmMy feelgood movieKirsten DunstComedy filmsComedyTeen moviesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But in The Dead of Winter, the historian and folklorist Sarah Clegg reveals a lesser known side to the festive season, unearthing unsettling midwinter traditions and stories that fell out of favour in the Victorian age.Subtitled The Demons, Witches and Ghosts of Christmas, the book opens with Clegg embarking on a pre-dawn walk to a graveyard on Christmas Eve. She is recreating an old Swedish tradition called årsgång, or “year walk”, which is said to offer glimpses into the walker’s future along with “shadowy enactments of the burials of anyone who will die in the village this coming year”.Elsewhere, Clegg tells of horned figures rampaging through the streets in Salzburg on Krampus night; dawn solstice rituals at Stonehenge; and horse’s skulls mounted on sticks in Chepstow, their cloaked carriers engaging in a battle of rhyming insults. There are chilling stories of an Icelandic ogress who kidnaps people and turns them into stew as her Yule cat looks on, and witches who find children who haven’t done their chores, cut open their bellies and stuff them full of straw.The narrator is Antonia Beamish, who delights in the mischief and menace of these outre seasonal happenings. In the 19th century, Christmas became a more sedate, domestic affair as a twinkly figure based on Saint Nicholas caught the public imagination.

One lies in the name of his superyacht, which sank off the coast of Sicily in the early hours of 19 August 2024. He had named the boat Bayesian to honour Bayes’s theorem, a mathematical rule that helps you weigh up the probability of something given the available evidence, which served as Lynch’s guiding light over the course of a tempestuous career. The theorem was “a beautiful key to our minds”, Lynch believed. But it was entirely incapable of predicting the outcome that morning, when the yacht capsized during a storm, killing seven people, including Lynch, his 18-year-old daughter Hannah and his US lawyer, Chris Morvillo.A second irony lies in the fact that Lynch had just come through the trial of his life, one he felt was bound to end in jail, where he thought he could die. Somehow, to everyone’s astonishment, an American jury had acquitted him and his co-defendanton all 15 counts of fraud.As Katie Prescott sets it out in this excellent, meticulously researched biography, Lynch was a monstrous man in many ways, but a gifted one, and it is hard to begrudge him his initial success. Born in 1965 to a firefighter father and a nurse mother, he spent the first eight years of his life in Ilford, east London, a rough suburb in those days, where the family felt like outsiders because of their Irish background. He’d been born with an unusual physical trait, having no fingerprints. It was an obvious metaphor for his future acquittal. As he himself would joke: “I would make an excellent criminal!”Lynch the student could be charming and good company, but the business world brought out an unscrupulous sideHe was also blessed with brains, musical talent and drive. Aged 11, he won a scholarship to Bancroft’s, a private school in London’s Woodford Green, where he proved an excellent student. He was fascinated by mechanics and electronics, saving up to buy a BBC Micro and teaching himself how to program. He started his first company in his bedroom at the age of 16, with a school friend: Lynett Systems, as it was called, would produce a cheap but widely used music sampler called Lynex. Soon he was off to Cambridge, where he earned a PhD by using neural networks to find ways computers could learn to recognise speech, images and text. He continued to pursue his business ideas in parallel with his doctorate.Lynch the student could be charming and good company, but the business world brought out an unscrupulous side. He was a fluent liar, able to make up credible stories on the spot, and would routinely exaggerate his company’s capabilities and experience. Business, he believed, was mostly a show: the trick was to make clients believe you could deliver the goods, then find out how to actually do that later. He was harsh with anyone who held him back, including people he owed money to. One of his first companies, Cambridge Neurodynamics, even had a fictional finance director, “Frank Bridges”, who was always out of the office when creditors came calling.As a boss, Lynch was awful. One of his companies was “an archetype of workplace toxicity”, according to Prescott. An ex-staffer described the working environment as “horrible, horrible, horrible”. He was bullying and intolerant, and when things went wrong employees were assaulted by a barrage of shouting. He seems deliberately to have designed a sinister corporate culture. Visitors to one office found a circular tank of piranhas in reception, occasionally with a half-eaten fish flapping around on one fin. This, he would say, was where failing salespeople would get dunked. Meeting rooms here were named after Bond villains: Dr No, Goldfinger, Scaramanga.Yet this hellish environment somehow produced results. One of Cambridge Neurodynamics’ early successes, ironically enough, was a fingerprint recognition system. Others included technology for reading car number plates, and optical character recognition software. In 1996, he launched Autonomy, the company for which he would become famous. It specialised in business search engines, based on Bayesian principles. Its core product was the data-processing package IDOL, something “like a box of Lego which could be adapted to customer needs”, according to Prescott. When it worked, it could be “awe-inspiring”, but sometimes it didn’t.Autonomy floated on the London Stock Exchange in October 2000, with an astonishing valuation of £4.1bn. Lynch now had the money and recognition he craved. He would be invited on to a BBC board, he had a country pile in Suffolk, sponsored Tottenham Hotspur and counted peers and politicians among his friends. But with Autonomy’s status as a public company came financial scrutiny, and pressure to deliver results. Sales figures were released quarterly, and analysts and traders – “twits in suits”, as Lynch called them – would downgrade his stock or short it if sales didn’t live up to forecasts. The company started to get creative.Prescott describes one technique for inflating sales using resellers. If a major software deal was in the pipeline but hadn’t come through by the quarterly deadline, Autonomy would call a friendly reseller at the last minute and ask them to make the purchase in lieu of the end client. This effectively meant they could register tomorrow’s jam in today’s accounts. But sometimes the deal didn’t land – the client never signed, tomorrow’s jam didn’t arrive – so Autonomy had to recompense the reseller in other, spurious ways.These tactics might not have mattered so much had Hewlett-Packard not paid $11.7bn for Autonomy in 2011 – a terrible deal, in which the slow-moving, monolithic US tech giant ignored all the warning signs and the chatter among London analysts about Autonomy’s numbers. HP’s board quickly regretted the decision and appointed a new CEO, Meg Whitman, who wrote down the acquisition’s value by $8.8bn and launched a $5bn lawsuit against Lynch.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

In 2018, a San Francisco court convicted Autonomy’s chief financial officer Sushovan Hussain of serious fraud and sentenced him to five years in jail and a $10m fine. In 2022, a court in London found that Lynch and Hussain had acted fraudulently and subsequently judged that HP was owed hundreds of millions of dollars. Lynch was extradited in handcuffs to the US, where he was put on trial with Steve Chamberlain, Autonomy’s VP of Finance, in San Francisco. Lynch put their chances of winning at 0.4%. Both defendants were found not guilty on all counts. Lynch and his defence team were ecstatic about the verdict, Chris Morvillo writing on social media: “And they all lived happily ever after”. In fact they lived happily for just 73 more days.To celebrate their win, Mike and his wife, Angela, decided to take the Bayesian on a series of cruises around southern Italy, inviting various supporters and associates. Lynch was no sailor, but he loved the seclusion the boat offered, and was immensely proud of its a 72-metre mast, one of the tallest in the world – a feature that some have speculated made it more vulnerable in strong winds, although the yacht’s manufacturer has defended its design. Through July and into August, it pottered around Capri and the Aeolian Islands. Then, in the middle of the month, the court victors were overtaken by a sequence of near-impossible coincidences, as Prescott sets out in pacily written detail.On 17 August, Steve Chamberlain left his Cambridgeshire home for a long run and was hit by a car. He would die three days later, on 20 August. About 4am on 19 August, when the Bayesian was anchored off the Sicilian fishing village of Porticello, she was caught in a sudden thunderstorm. The skipper prepared to turn her into the wind, but a gust caught her and knocked her on her side. At a heel angle of just 42 degrees, she began to ship vast quantities of water. Moments later, she was gone.The Curious Case of Mike Lynch: The Improbable Life & Death of a Tech Billionaire by Katie Prescott is published by Macmillan Business (£22).

There, in ruins, was the city in which she was born and grew up, reported on, then chronicled in fiction. Tergit had been one of the shining lights of interwar Berlin’s flourishing journalistic scene; she had also married into one of the city’s most prominent Jewish families. In 1931 her debut novel announced her as a literary phenomenon.Then the Nazis came to power. Tergit was on an enemies list. She fled, first to Czechoslovakia, then to Palestine, and finally to London, where she lived from 1938 until her death in 1982. Never again did she call Berlin home. When she visited after the war, she found no real place in the conservative postwar German literary world – and no real audience for The Effingers, her newly completed magnum opus. A version was printed in 1951, but to little acclaim; only recently has a critical rediscovery in Germany established Tergit as one of the country’s major authors. Now, thanks to an excellent translation by Sophie Duvernoy, The Effingers is appearing in English.The novel follows four generations of the extended Effinger family, Jewish industrialists ensconced in Berlin high society, from the Bismarck-loving 1870s to the rise of fascism in the 1930s. Its central figure, Paul Effinger, heads to Berlin to make his fortune in industry. Paul, an ascetic enamoured of mass production, marries into the elite Oppner-Goldschmidt family, as does his brother, Karl. The novel follows numerous members of the extended clan through what is considered a golden age for assimilated Jewish life in Berlin. The city changes profoundly in those decades: rapid population growth, technological advances, massive inequality and inconsistent bursts of progressivism. Ultimately, the interwar era’s political and economic instability brings disaster, as does surging antisemitism.Tergit narrates all this in sober, precise, dialogue-driven scenes, building her novel from short, reporterly chapters that vary subtly in tempo while shifting between perspectives and registers. Her authorial presence comes across not in explication or reflection but rather in what she chooses to show, and when, and how. No one point of view transcends the others. Even the admirably liberal, progress-minded ideals of certain characters are undermined by jump-cuts that show how women and the poor were often excluded from such optimism.The party scenes are filled with meticulous descriptions of fashion, food, interior decor and gossipThe Effingers is a wonderfully vivid social portrait of pre-Nazi Berlin, whose party scenes are filled with meticulous descriptions of fashion, food, interior decor and gossip; but it is also an intellectual portrait, chiefly because its characters all think and read and argue. Tergit uses the multigenerational novel form less to explore family dynamics and more to trace shifts between consecutive epochs that feel – as her characters keep saying – like the dawning of a new age. Protestant morality, industrial utopianism, liberal cosmopolitanism, various versions of Judaism, women’s liberation, nationalism, socialism: all of these inhabit the text, often in surprising combinations.When fascism arrives in the novel, it is sudden and disorienting, but also continuous with older tendencies and ideas. With its social breadth and historical depth, The Effingers casts nazism not as a fairytale triumph of evil over good but rather through the often incoherent mixture of desires, ideas and material conditions that motivated individuals and groups to join the fascist enterprise. Tergit prefers detail to abstraction – and details resist grand explanations.10 of the best novels set in Germany – that will take you thereRead moreIn 1949, she wrote to a publisher that The Effingers was “not the novel of Jewish fate, but rather a Berlin novel in which very many people are Jewish”. Fundamentally, Tergit’s novel lays a claim on the city as a place for Jewish people. It rejects outright the sort of fatalism that insists on the inherent misery, even impossibility, of Jewish life in Germany. It also seems sceptical towards Zionist nationalism as a form of redemption: Uncle Waldemar gives a heartfelt speech in defence of assimilated Jewish identity against all ethnic nationalisms, accusing the nascent Zionist movement of using “every argument of this dreadful new time for its own purposes”.Like Paul’s daughter Lotte, Tergit travelled to Palestine in 1933. There she found herself out of step with Zionist emigrants who she felt bore more intellectual kinship to German blood-and-soil thinkers than to families such as hers: “They saw anyone travelling to Palestine with a sorrowful heart as a traitor,” she later wrote. Tergit refuses to see the destruction of Jewish Berlin as inevitable. Her novel narrates a family’s tragedy – but she will not let that tragedy define them.The Effingers: A Berlin Saga by Gabriele Tergit, translated by Sophie Duvernoy, is published by Pushkin (£20).

Finch was a versatile poet whose talents embraced a variety of forms and genres, including satire. In The Apology, she tackles in a spritely manner what was essential material for a female poet of her period: a defence of her daring to practise the male profession of poetry.The poem, solidly crafted inheroic couplets, begins with the self-mocking admission “’Tis true, I write”, and goes on to argue her claim to be a poet – a fantasy figure seen “to play the fool” and idly pursue the muse in an idyllic pastoral setting. This ironical portrayal is made interesting by the concept of “feigned ideas”. The phrase denies the myth: poets, including women, are capable of imagination and thought, and take pleasure in those challenges. Finch claims the art and its seriousness, while insisting on it as one of her “pleasures” – “pleasures” being a concession to the diminished view of women’s capacities.A duo of female characters is called on to help press home Finch’s point: Myra, who “paints her face” instead of “a thought”, and Lamia, who seems to take her inspiration from a “manly bumper” of strong spirits. Myra is the rejecting lover in Fulke Greville’sCaelica 22; Lamia may have been a Libyan queen.It would be interesting to know if these brightly, briefly evoked figures disguise living women in the countess’s friendship circle.Unlike Myra and Lamia, Flavia, in the poem’s second stanza, has been identified as Finch’s close friendCatherine Fleming. After the self-deprecating first line, Flavia is summoned to aid Finch in her argument for continuing to write despite her lack of success. The subversive joke about a woman, confidently visible at the age of 40 in spite of her earlier youthful dismissal by “all the town”, would no doubt be one that the two close friends enjoyed sharing.While there was a convention for female writers of the period to express their feelings of humility and audacity in attempting verse, Finch’s references in The Apology to a failed career and poor skill can’t be taken entirely seriously. At the same time, they can’t entirely be dismissed. She was not without her supporters, and benefited from the encouragement of her husband, Heneage Finch. Her Pindaric ode The Spleen was published in Gildon’s Miscellany in 1701, and in a collection of her poetry, which also included a tragic drama, that appeared in 1713. But her work deserved far more visibility than it achieved during her lifetime, and its writer must have been stung at times by the reception from the male literary establishment.While The Apology ends with a defiant thrust against masculine achievement, Finch demonstrates a sense of balance. Her final quatrain declares that, because “our first breach with Heaven” (the fall) brought imperfection to the human species, the male wits also produce work in which “there’s less to be applauded than forgiven”. By limiting her criticism to the consciously self-admiring young writers-about-town, the wits, she may not be making too harsh a judgment.The Apology appears to be an early poem, belonging to the Folger Manuscript of 1702. I have based the text on amodernised version of the poem, except for a small change to the eighth line of the second stanza, where, for the sake of the rhythm, I restored the spelling of “even” to “e’vn”. The original may be read in the collection of Finch’s workhere.Explore more on these topicsPoetryCarol Rumens's poem of the weekfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Millions of people have fond memories of playing the original Red and Blue games, or trading cards in the playground for that elusive shiny Charizard (if your school didn’t ban them). The franchise has only grown since then – but, where the trading cards are concerned, things have taken an unexpected and unfortunate turn. It’s now almost impossible to get your hands on newly released cards thanks to an insane rise in reselling and scalping over the past year.Selling on your old cards to collectors has always been part of the hobby, and like baseball cards or Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon cards can sometimes go for thousands of pounds. However, the resale market for Pokémon has climbed so high that even new cards are valued at hundreds, before they’ve even been released. The latest set, Phantasmal Flames, had a rare special illustration Charizard that was beingvalued at more than £600before anyone had even found one. When a pack of cards retails at about £4, there’s a huge potential profit to be had.This has led to a speculative stock market developing around the card game with adults snapping up all of the cards they can get their hands on, making it impossible for kids, who may actually want to collect them or play the game associated with the cards, to get their hands on it.It’s become quite unpleasant at times. I’ve heard of stores where people have been attacked or there have been robberiesOnline, via retailers such as Amazon, you can only request to buy Pokémon cards, after which everyone is entered into an opaque raffle for the chance to buy them. In the real world, meanwhile, resellers will queue for hours outside shops, hover around shelves as they’re being restocked and buy up every item before anyone else can see it – all just to buy boxes that are often kept sealed for later resale.“My staff have had customers threatening to come back and rip their heads off,” says Ben Thyer, owner of BathTCG – an independent shop specialising in trading card games. “It’s become quite unpleasant at times. I’ve heard of other stores where people have been attacked or there have been robberies. We’ve even seen people who buy our products and list them immediately on Facebook, while still in our carrier bags, or sell it right outside the shop. We’re even anxious to put stuff on the shelf for the public because we just don’t want to entice that sort of behaviour. We used to sell whole boxes of booster packs but now we’ve had to stop doing that, and even place limits on the individual packs.”View image in fullscreen‘My staff have had customers threatening to come back and rip their heads off’ … Ben Thyer, owner of BathTCG.Photograph: Daniella LucasFinley Pink, from Keynsham, travelled to BathTCG to arrive almost two hours before opening time to secure some cards at the recent launch of the Phantasmal Flames set. He was first in a line of 40 people. “This is the first set I’ve arrived early for, as I’ve been unable to get cards at other times. It’s a real struggle to find them,” he tells us. “Scalpers are making it impossible to find cards. It’s crazy and YouTubers talking up the money are making things even crazier!”Adding to the issue of scalpers is the popularity of YouTubers and TikTok influencers recording themselves opening packs, flicking through the contents at mesmerising speed, and listing the card values as they go, exaggerating reactions when they find a “hit”. Common cards are discarded, and only high-value cards matter. The joy of collecting or playing for fun is no longer the point – it’s all about maximising “value”.Pete Sessions, a project manager from Bristol, attended a Pokémon play night at the shop with his son Alfie and is concerned about influencers’ impact on the hobby for his child. “He’s been into Pokémon for a few years, but just got into collecting the cards over the past six months – I’ve had to ask shops when their stock drop days are just to try to find some,” he tells us. “Alfie watches YouTubers and he’s become very aware of the ‘value’ of cards. I’m worried about the perception that it’s easy to make loads of money, when that probably isn’t the case.”“People are opening these amazing cards on stream, but you don’t know how many thousands of packs they’ve probably gone through, or how much money they’ve spent,” adds Thyer. “So then they feed you the good stuff – that dopamine hit – and you think: ‘Oh, I can do that!’ And then you spend a silly amount of money hoping to get one hit.”The hype around potentially making hundreds of pounds by just opening a pack of cards has resulted in a volatile market, to the point that people now use apps such asCollectrto track their card portfolio for price rises and falls. It’s also led to devious practices such as selling fake cards, or opening and resealing packs after swapping out any rare cards.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toPushing ButtonsFree weekly newsletterKeza MacDonald's weekly look at the world of gamingEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Cards can be sent to independent organisations, who rate and seal cards to potentially increase their value, depending on the grade they’re given. Card shows have now become a staple up and down the country, where hobbyists looking for their favourite cards are surrounded by those making trade deals worth, sometimes, tens of thousands.Despite the fact that The Pokémon Company printed10.2bn cardsin the year to March 2025, they’re still struggling to keep up with demand. When approached for comment, it shared astatement from seven months ago, saying that the company is “actively working to print more of the impacted Pokémon TCG products as quickly as possible and at maximum capacity”.Fortunately there are signs that the reseller market is starting to correct itself as more supply for older sets has started to trickle back on to shelves. “There are signs of the market cracking – prices of singles are coming down, sealed products are coming down. People aren’t as ferocious as they once were,” Thyer says. “There’s also a lot of people now thinking, ‘Christmas is soon and I need some money because I’ve not made what I was hoping for [from reselling cards]’. So we’ll see it dip, but then early 2026 brings Pokémon’s 30th anniversary, so I think we’ll see another crazy period.”While many shops have now adjusted booster pack pricing to reflect their perceived value and make the most of the Pokémon card boom, BathTCG refuses to give into that temptation. “We won’t do it to our customers,” Thyer says. “It’s hard as a business owner to say, ‘I don’t want to make more money’, but I don’t want to be another one of those shops remembered for scalping. Once the bubble bursts and everything goes back to normal, hopefully people will remember that we protected our community and looked after our players – that we ensured our local customers got cards at reasonable prices.”Explore more on these topicsPokémonGamesCollectingChildrenShoppingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Will the fire be real? Where will we sit? Luckily, it doesn’t take long for Benji’s anxiety to settle.PunchdrunkEnrichment’s new show has, like its predecessors, been created with schools, communities and children in mind. It’s a gentle and generous piece of immersive theatre – one that often, quite literally, takes the children by their hands and invites them to become part of the story.View image in fullscreenSpecial moments … Amari Harris in Punchdrunk Enrichment’s Fireside Tales.Photograph: Nina PhotographyTo start off, we’re invited to browse the “bookstore”, crammed full of intriguing trinkets to touch and play with. Anxiety quelled and curiosity piqued, it’s time to enter the Punchdrunk Enrichment store where the show proper begins. And what a store it is, designed with immaculate attention to detail by Mydd Pharo. The shelves spill over with quirky objects; clusters of feathers, boxes of globes, bundles of photos, twinkling lava lamps and dusty typewriters.Rebecca Clark and Amari Harris play the two storeowners, Cosi and Ali, brimming with enthusiasm and earnestness. Their task, the two explain, is to categorise all the world’s stories: air, water, fire and earth. The children listen carefully and happily join in. One kid shares her story about alien peacocks, wafting a bright blue feather in the air. A little boy holds aloft a torch and when a telephone starts ringing, a girl gingerly picks it up. A new story is coming, the girl proudly tells us. And it’s a fire story!At this point, Benji is so excited he’s running on the spot. Tiny flares of light flicker about the store as the fire story “jumps” from one object to the next, lighting up the room in a dance of flames. We follow the flame out of the store and into a courtyard. It’s another beautiful space with crumbling walls covered in ivy, a huge unlit fire and clusters of logs to perch on. “This is amaaaazing,” exclaims Benji, as he grabs my hand and finds a good spot to sit down and take it all in.The atmosphere is entrancing but Steve McCourt’s script starts to feel strained. The two store members share their stories about home and, oddly, they’re the least memorable part of the show. But there are still some special moments. We’re asked to draw a picture of home and, clutching scraps of paper and sticks of charcoal, the children quietly scribble away. Happy. Focused. Utterly immersed in their imaginations.AtPunchdrunk Enrichment Stores, London, until 4 JanuaryExplore more on these topicsChildren's theatrePlay timeTheatreChristmas showsPunchdrunkImmersive theatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

But like Dru Hill, Braxton and her live band initially seem to be stuck in the era when the music was made, with the same vocal prowess and flirty charm, just a little different in clothing and choreography.Then, nine songs in, she discusses her battles with lupus, and being told she’d never perform live again. Breathe Again is sung through tears in a single spotlight. “As long as I live, I will never forget tonight,” she says earnestly. Power chords catapult us into Long As I Live, and by now Braxton holds our melted hearts in her hands. She encores with Un-break My Heart, sung impeccably but short one verse.In dazzlingly matching all-white outfits, Boyz II Men open with Motownphilly and then move through Water Runs Dry and On Bended Knee. Their three-part harmonies are awe-inspiring: totally tight and unblemished, but also responsive to their live band.View image in fullscreenDazzling … Boyz II Men.Photograph: Laura Rose/The GuardianThey cover the music that influenced them – Shawn Stockman’s solo on a purple guitar during their cover of Prince’s Purple Rain is a standout – and music influenced by them, with Wanyá Morris heading up Bruno Mars’s Locked Out of Heaven.We finally get into the Christmas spirit with Silent Night and their beloved Let It Snow, both good enough for year-round listening, before a closing run of One Sweet Day, I’ll Make Love To You and End of the Road. The production across the evening isn’t as slick as these musicians deserved, with technical glitches during early sets, and in spite of rich sonics, it feels as though the stars are performing a tribute act to themselves. But, transported temporarily to the golden age of R&B and some of its architects, the audience go home dusted with glitter rather than snow.Explore more on these topicsMusicR&Blive music reviewsShareReuse this content"

He mutters constantly. In one scene he falls suddenly out of a kitchen cupboard. In another, he pulls his lurid green coat closed over his head, childlike in his efforts to disappear.Blake is the deeply troubled protagonist of Oliver Leith and Matt Copson’s 2022 opera Last Days, based onGus Van Sant’s film of the same name. With his 90s grunge-icon blond hair and baggy jeans, Blake is unmistakably the alter ego ofNirvanafrontman Kurt Cobain: these imagined last days are his. But it is what we hear in Leith’s operatic version, revived for the first time at the Royal Opera’s Linbury theatre, that transforms this depiction of a person undone into something truly disturbing.View image in fullscreenDeeply troubled … Last Days at Linbury theatre.Photograph: Lola MansellSome of the score is purely narrative. Blake – a non-singing role taken here by actor Jake Dunn – is hounded by a stream of fans, friends, Mormons, deliveries (“D”, “H”, “Lllllll”, trilled soprano Mimi Doulton at the door, eliciting one of the evening’s rare laughs) and even a private investigator. Each gets their moment in the musical spotlight, often accompanied by the auto-melancholia of artfully raw sustained strings. The Jehovah’s Witnesses barged their way in with a kind of hymn – this is noBook of Mormon– amid vigorous banjo-style strumming from the strings of 12 Ensemble, conducted by Jack Sheen, who joined in lustily with the singing.Elsewhere, passages of spare, olde worlde polyphony seem to emanate as a distant musical memory. Leith even orchestrates the household of interlopers gradually falling asleep, conjuring a chorus of snores, whistles and groans that accompanies Blake as he stalks around with a shotgun. The singing was largely excellent – Patricia Auchterlonie’s crystalline superfan a highlight – and the movement in Copson and Anna Morrissey’s production slick.The most chilling scenes are those that foreground Leith’s remarkable way with timbre, blurring the boundaries of what we hear. When the slow, gentle bending of pitches in the strings suddenly coalesce into the sound of a distant siren. When the clanking of empty bottles turns out to be a tuned melodic riff echoed by voices and instruments, rubbish made musical. When delicate, stratospheric slides in the strings merge seamlessly into the sound of fireworks as light plays across the Disney-ish forest backdrop (by Matt Copson).When the phone rings and Blake answers, the voice at the other end beatboxes so frantically that words are incomprehensible. Only the surtitles track the caller’s business proposition, its mundanity duetting with the virtuoso nonsense that we and Blake hear. Blake, we understand, is not OK – but in this piece our own grip on reality is also repeatedly and powerfully challenged.Last Days is at Linbury theatre, London, until 3 JanuaryExplore more on these topicsOperaClassical musicRoyal Opera HousereviewsShareReuse this content"

You would expect one to cancel out the other, but here the narrative cracks forward with such certainty, you can afford the odd moment to laugh.It is funny that Baron Aaron (Tyler Collins) is deep in denial about his failed shipping business; that Beauty (Israela Efomi) carries with her a copy of an etiquette manual called How to Be a Lovely Young Lady; that her sister, Bright (Holly Howden Gilchrist), cares more for inventions than everyday expressions of affection; that the cat and dog (Michael Guest and Martin Donaghy) are falling ever so sweetly in love; and that the housekeeper Mrs Flobberlyboo (Elicia Daly) has a taste for modernist singing that makes the rest of Nikola Kodjabashia’s angular score seem conventional.View image in fullscreenUrgency and wit … Tyler Collins, Holly Howden Gilchrist and Israela Efomi in Beauty and the Beast.Photograph: Tommy Ga-KenFunny too that the Beast (Nicholas Marshall) gets a build-up of shadow-puppet ferocity and off-stage growling before turning up in feathery turquoise, sticky-out ears and, later, a pink bow tie. It does not take much for Beauty to fall for such a forlorn creature in a play less interested in the story’s undercurrent of adolescent awakening – the decorous feminine taming the dangerous masculine – than in the way love can be variously thwarted, unrequited and misunderstood.If, consequently, you miss some of the tension in the Beauty/Beast relationship, you are richly compensated in the staging by Dominic Hill and Joanna Bowman which, behind the fun and musicality, is serious and scary.The set by Rachael Canning, with its broken slats and deep perspective, is dreamlike and provisional, the Beast’s palace a warren of shifting staircases and passageways where doors – and the secrets behind them – pull in and out of focus. Lizzie Powell’s lighting adds to the gothic intensity as Mrs Flobberlyboo reveals her dark intent (“I’m not upset, I’m evil”), while the sisters and their pets go on an interspecies quest for the true meaning of love. Acted with urgency and wit, it is a nourishing tale of acceptance.At Citizens theatre, Glasgow, until 31 DecemberExplore more on these topicsTheatreChildren's theatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

Then the offers disappeared. Now, as her renaissance continues, she is taking on Mrs Malaprop in The RivalsMon 8 Dec 2025 00.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 8 Dec 2025 07.11 ESTShareAfter six decades as an actor, Patricia Hodge says she still gets nervous before a play opens. “I think nerves are always the fear of the unknown,” she says. “Particularly with comedy, where there is no knowing how the audience will react: you’ve got to surf that.”We meet on a sunny winter morning at theOrange Tree theatrein Richmond, south-west London, where Hodge is about to appear in The Rivals, to celebrate the 250th anniversary of the Richard B Sheridan play, in which she plays the ironic – sorry, iconic – Mrs Malaprop. “You’re sort of in a tunnel, your entire being is focused on this,” she says. She was here in rehearsals until 11pm the night before. Today, she is sitting at a table with a large coffee. Does she enjoy this bit, the putting together of a play? “I think it’s love-hate actually. The process is really why I do theatre.” She says she finds it energising, “but it’s also very trying, and you just don’t want to be left with your own limitations”.View image in fullscreenAs Mrs Pumphrey in All Creatures Great and Small.Photograph: Helen Williams/©Playground Television UK Ltd/5 Broadcasting LimitedHodge’s first work was in the theatre, although it was TV that brought her to a far wider audience: she is most likely to be recognised on the street as Penny, the overbearing mother in the joyous sitcom Miranda, though her career seems to have spanned everything from Shakespeare to Pinter, Orton to Frayn. She has even been in a Bruce Willis movie (Sunset, 1988). Hodge wanted to do The Rivals, she says with a smile, because she lives up the road in west London. “So this is a very local theatre for me. But, much more importantly, [the smaller theatres] is where the work that we all joined for is being done.” Like the Almeida, she says, for David Hare’s 1997 revival of Heartbreak House, and, most recently, the Donmar, in Watch on the Rhine in 2023.Back to The Rivals, the vain and deluded Mrs Malaprop must be fun to play. It is, says Hodge. “I’ve always seen her as one of those people who has absolutely no real self-awareness. They don’t quite realise a disconnect between the way they present themselves and the way they’re seen. I think that’s interesting, and I suppose we’re all like that a bit.”Many of her roles, at least in recent years, share an upper-class eccentricity – there’s Miranda’s mother (“such fun”), and currently, Mrs Pumphrey in Channel 5’s star-packed All Creatures Great and Small, who, in the latest series, called out the emergency vet to talk about the sex life of Tricki Woo, her pekingese. “I suppose that’s the level you get to when you get to a certain age.” She points to the “gallery of grotesques” that Maggie Smith once wryly noted. “That’s what they give you to do, but no, I’ve always liked eccentric people. I found them rather interesting.” Later, she mentions one of her greatest friends is Miriam Margolyes, with whom she made the 1975 TV adaptation of Muriel Spark’s The Girls of Slender Means. Hodge does a brilliant impression of Margolyes visiting her son’s school once, and shocking the children. “I’m drawn to people who make me laugh. I love a slightly outrageous thing in people, but not exclusively – I’ve got friends of every different stripe.”Eccentricity is a liberation, perhaps, for women who reach an age when they stop caring about being judged. “Yes, what’s that Jenny Joseph poem?” she says, referring to Warning, which begins: “When I am an old woman, I shall wear purple.” I look pointedly at the purplish velvet suit that Hodge – fine-boned beautiful, 79, and far from seeming “old” – is wearing today, and she laughs. “She was speaking as somebody who had a more ordinary life,” Hodge points out. “Our life is about dressing up, isn’t it, escaping the real world.”It’s a thread she can trace back to childhood, growing up in Grimsby, in the town’s poshest (though this is all relative) hotel. She has been thinking about it a lot recently, she says. “I’m quite sure that it’s contributed to what I ended up doing.” The family lived in a flat at the top of the hotel, overlooking the docks. “There was nothing otherworldly about it. But I’d go downstairs and there was this whole other thing.” There was something stage-like about the parts of the hotel that were on show, and the people who passed through them. “Then you go through the doors into the kitchen, and you’ve got something entirely different going on.” The hotel had a ballroom, where Hodge would invent shows, “so it allowed for all kinds of fantasy escape”.View image in fullscreenHodge with Miranda Hart in the hit sitcom Miranda.Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/AlamyA revolving parade of hotel guests would trail their glamorous lives with them, along with their luggage. There would be TV presenters, radio personalities and – more excitingly – rock stars, including the 60s band Manfred Mann. A film crew stayed and put Hodge’s younger sister in the film, much to the future actor’s annoyance (she wasn’t allowed the time off school). When Violet Carson, Coronation Street’s Ena Sharples, stayed, Hodge asked for her autograph. “She spoke beautifully, because that [original] cast of Coronation Street were actors doing the most wonderful work in rep.” It was a glimpse of another life. “I thought, that’s the world I want to be in.”There was no professional theatre company near Grimsby, she says. “So nobody became a professional actor, because it wasn’t in the language. But there was a lot of amateur [theatre], and amateur things are what kept it all afloat.” What made her think she could be a professional actor, then? “I don’t know that I necessarily did think I could do it. I knew that I just wanted to.” The nearest thing to the performing arts was dance, so Hodge did that instead (her mother also insisted on piano and elocution lessons). Never chosen for the school play, Hodge and a few friends wrote their own revue to perform; the following year, they were invited to audition. She loved, she says, “just getting up and becoming somebody else on a stage. I think there’s always a mixture of shyness, well, introversion and extroversion, and you need to step over that threshold.”Hodge trained to be a teacher first, and taught for a year, but she couldn’t shake the feeling she should be acting. She applied to the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art (Lamda) and got in. After that, she went into repertory theatre, a world that has all but disappeared now. “It’s an apprenticeship. You can learn so much. Art can’t be learned as much as it has to be practised, and that was the training ground. I think we’ve lost a huge amount, quite apart from the fact that it is so wonderful for a community [to have a theatre]. You know, every major city in Germany has state-supported theatre. That’s why they’re so good.” For the UK, she says, “it’s tragic”. At the time, Hodge had to earn her Equity card with so many weeks in rep, a system she also thinks worked. “It stopped people from too big a sprint before they were ready.”View image in fullscreenPerforming in A Night Under The Stars in 2005.Photograph: David Lodge/FilmMagicHodge was ready by the time she landed in the West End – a small role in the Ben Travers farce Rookery Nook, and as understudy for the lead – and her next job was in the musical Pippin, directed by the legendary choreographer Bob Fosse. It was thrilling, she says, although Fosse – whose film Lenny, with Dustin Hoffman, was still in production – wasn’t around enough: “We didn’t get him until about the last 10 days.” Last year, Hodge appeared in the two-night West End performance of thePippin 50th anniversary concert, which was “one of the best experiences of my life. If you stay in the ring long enough …” she says, laughing.At the time of the 1973 production, did she think she had made it? “I wasn’t very good in it, because I didn’t get much direction,” she says, breezily. “I didn’t really know what I was doing.” Still, it must have been thrilling to have been a young, beautiful actor working in the West End in the 70s. “Oh, wonderful,” she says. “All the different casts, the shows. It was the big time of the rock musical.” She had parts in The Two Gentlemen of Verona and Hair. “There was such a community. It was absolutely fantastic.”Parties? Drugs? “There were drugs,” she says, leaning forward slightly. “But I was really an innocent with all that.” Her only time, she says with a laugh, was an incident at drama school involving some curious cakes that were being passed around. “I didn’t know what I was doing. I was so ill.” It put her off for life. “So I was never part of that.” She was similarly naive when it came to sexual harassment, which must have been a hazard of the job for any young actor. “It didn’t really cross my path,” she says. “I think there was one producer that grabbed me one day, and you just thought: Oh, for God’s sake. You just sort of thought it was part of male behaviour.”View image in fullscreen‘Screen [work] can eat you up and spit you out’ …Hodge with Leo McKern in Rumpole of the Bailey.Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/AlamyFrom the beginning of her career, Hodge never wanted to be constrained to one area, although when she first tried to move into TV, people considered her only a theatre actor. She has always done a wide range, including radio and cabaret (she put on shows for several years with the colourful critic Sheridan Morley). “All these things are different disciplines, and I think they keep you at the sharp end, and they make life interesting.” She was wary of only focusing on film and TV. “I think screen can eat you up and spit you out.”She had a terrific early run – her 1978 TV breakthrough as the formidable barrister Phyllida Trant in Rumpole of the Bailey, as the lead in the mystery series Jemima Shore Investigates (from 1983), and in the 1986 adaptation of Fay Weldon’s The Life and Loves of a She-Devil. She played the lead in Betrayal, the 1983 film version of Harold Pinter’s play (a few years later, she would play it on radio, with Pinter himself). But, although she worked steadily, Hodge was part of that generation of actors who struggled to find roles good enough for them as they got older. For Hodge, “I think where it gets really bad is once you get to your 50s, because that’s when you notice that the men continue on, but the women that are cast with them are in their 30s. And that’s when you start to be sidelined. It probably hit me more from about 55 upwards.”As someone who loves to work, and who had amassed so much experience by then, that must have been difficult. “Well, yes and no,” she says. “The thing that was different for me was I was a very late mother. When they were very young, I was working quite a lot, but by the time it started to slow down, the children needed my attention. I think having another life is really important. If this business is all you have, it’s going to kick you. Family life was always so important.” Hodge had her sons in her 40s, after years of infertility. “Every day of my life, I’m thankful for it and for what it’s brought to me.” For her, she says: “It’s the real meaning of life.”View image in fullscreenIn the 1983 film version of Harold Pinter’s Betrayal.Photograph: 20thC.Fox/Everett/ShutterstockHodge was with her husband, Peter Owen, a music publisher, for more than 40 years, and has spoken movingly before about caring for him when he was diagnosed with dementia (he died in 2016). After a long and happy marriage, how do you rebuild a life? “I think what I’ve learned is that it’s because I had something else, I didn’t have to find something else, and that was work. I sort of lost myself in that, not totally – family life goes on – but it keeps me engaged and busy.” Selling the family home was difficult, but necessary. “The life in it wasn’t there any more, and much as I loved it, I was never going to get back that life.”She remembers her mother, a week after her father died, saying – she repeats it with a perfect comic pause – “well, at least now I can have a curry”. “I thought, actually, that’s a wonderful line, because you look at the breadth of that – you’ve shared your life and you compromise yourself. So you have a kind of autocracy that comes in, you can do what you want, when you feel like it. But of course, there’s an aloneness. I won’t say loneliness, because I have a lot of wonderful friends, not just people in the business, people I’ve held on to for many years.”She has mentioned friendships a few times – not least when I mention last year’s Arthur’s Whisky, the film about three friends which also starred Lulu and the magnificent Diane Keaton (“She was extraordinary, a wonderful woman. She was totally true to herself, she didn’t try to make herself other than what she was”). Does Hodge collect friendships? “Actually, my mother said that once – ‘Patricia collects people’ – and I don’t think I’ve thought of it, but yes, I just enjoy people a lot. I think you have to [in order to] step inside characters – you can play a monster, but that is a person underneath. So yes, I probably do.”View image in fullscreenDiane Keaton, Lulu and Patricia Hodge in Arthur’s Whisky.Photograph: SkyIt’s one reason she loves theatre (and also why she brought such energy to the Miranda ensemble). “I love company work, and [this play] is the essence of it. Something is only ever as good as the sum of its parts, and you have to fit into the mechanism.” It requires toughness and discipline, though I don’t suppose Hodge minds this. “I think we just challenge ourselves, just keep, every day, doing something that makes you uncomfortable.” Then a smile and a perfect comic pause. “And I say that because I’d like to crawl under a duvet at times.”The Rivals is at theOrange Treetheatre, Richmond, until 24 January; theTheatre Royal, Bath, from 27–31 January; and theArts Theatre Cambridgefrom 3–7 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsTheatreThe big interviewTelevisionOrange Tree theatreComedyinterviewsShareReuse this content"

But instead he reached into his car and took out the sawn-off shotgun you see in the movie’Interviews byDave SimpsonMon 8 Dec 2025 10.02 ESTLast modified on Mon 8 Dec 2025 13.26 ESTShareFrederick Brathwaite AKA Fab 5 Freddy, concept, actor, musical directorI was part of the New York graffiti artists the Fabulous 5, who were primarily known for painting whole subway cars on the Lexington Avenue line. Lee Quiñones was the group’s Michelangelo. I’d been running withJean-Michel Basquiatand wanted totake graffiti art into art spaces. I thought that an underground independent film could tell our story in the way we wanted.At an art show in Times Square I met Charlie Ahearn, who’d made an underground kung fu film, The Deadly Art of Survival, on Super 8. Charlie loved the movie idea and I explained that we could tell the story of an emerging new culture: graffiti art, breakdancing and rap. We wanted a movie with a narrative but a documentary feel, so alongside real rappers from the Bronx we had graffiti artists playing themselves, but as characters. Lee became Zoro, a kind of masked superhero. We wantedPhase 2– a giant of a graffiti writer who was making flyers for hip-hop parties – to represent the connection between graffiti art and hip-hop. However, he preferred to stay in the shadows. Charlie said: “Fred, you can do it!” So I became an actor, basing Phade, the club promoter, on Phase 2.Charlie insisted we make our own music. I knewBlondie’s Chris Stein and Debbie Harrybecause they’d bought art from me as well as Jean-Michel, so Charlie, Chris and I hooked up to do the score. Everybody said that Patti Astor, who plays Virginia the reporter, looked like Debbie Harry, and Blondie let us usetheir song Pretty Babyfor Virginia’s big entrance. Blondie were very supportive. When I heard Debbie sing “Fab 5 Freddy told me everybody’s fly” inRaptureI thought: “That’s me!”Although the Sugarhill Gang’s Rapper’s Delight was a big hit, most rappers weren’t making records yet. They’d just get on the mic for ages, so we edited the music scenes but kept their meaning. The film captures what was a very underground culture in a few ghetto neighbourhoods: the Bronx, Queens andBrooklyn. I could never have imagined it would become this huge global thing.Charlie Ahearn, writer, director, producerOne of Lee’s murals had appeared in The DeadlyArtof Survival, which I made for $1,000. I’d been trying to contact him but he was elusive. I think he thought I was a cop, or would lead him into situations where he’d be arrested. So when I was approached by Fab 5 Freddy, who’d seen my kung fu film and knew Lee, it was perfect.I went to a hip-hop jam in the Bronx with 10,000 kids and a gun went off. I thought we should have that in the movieI wanted to make a movie that would play in theatres to teenagers: a romance about a subway graffiti outlaw character being chased by the police.Lady Pink[artist Sandra Fabara] was hanging out with all these young wannabe graffiti artists. I took one look at her and thought: that’s the character who we named Rose “Lady Bug”. I approached Channel 4 in London and ZDF in Germany, sending each an envelope with a Xerox of a subway train, a cassette of a hip-hop club and a sheet outlining the idea. Each sent me $25,000, my only source of funding.View image in fullscreenCharlie Ahearn directing Wild Style.Photograph: TCD/Prod.DB/AlamyWhen I went to a hip-hop jam in the Bronx with 10,000 kids, a gun went off and I thought we should do something like that in the movie. I saw some guys leaning against a wall and asked them to be in a stick-up scene. I handed one a starting pistol but he said, “That’s a pussy gun,” reached into his car and took out the sawn-off shotgun you see in the film.When I approached [rapper] Busy Bee Starski at a jam he was smoking a joint, led me on stage and said without taking a breath: “Here’s Charlie Ahearn. He’s my movie producer.”Eventually I metGrandmaster Flash, who was already a star. I shot an amphitheatre scene with him performing with his group, the Furious Five, but I couldn’t use it because the sound was distorted. I had to restage the entire concert without Flash, who was away touring so couldn’t appear again – so his live show never made the film. Shit happens.When Wild Style opened in Times Square I paid some kids $25 each to distribute flyers in their schools, so at the first screenings they queued around the block. When it was shown in Japan, they thought it was a science fiction movie and that I’d invented this new culture. It’s been called the greatest hip-hop film ever made. It was certainly the first.Wild Style is available to stream on the Arrow Video Channel and to own on 4K UHD and Blu-rayExplore more on these topicsFilmHip-hopStreet artArtNew YorkSocial historyBrooklynfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It seems to notice me as well: when I stop, it stops too. It’s both awe-inspiring and unnerving.In the mirrors around the glowing orb, I spot Icelandic-Danish artistOlafur Eliasson– globally renowned for large-scale installations that challenge your sense of perception – posing for selfies with the crowd.It’s the opening night of Presence, a major exhibition spanning Eliasson’s 30-year practice that occupies the entire ground floor ofthe Gallery of Modern Art (Goma) in Meanjin/Brisbane. His 2014 work Riverbed – a room filled with 100 tonnes of sand, river pebbles and rock – makes its return, alongside immersive works that play with light, colour and movement, and photographs spotlighting the climate crisis.View image in fullscreenPresence (2025) by Olafur Eliasson.Photograph: Ágoston Horányi/Studio Olafur EliassonThe sun – also titled Presence – brings to mind The Weather Project, Eliasson’s acclaimed 2003 installation for Tate Modern’s Turbine Hall. Thatbecame a kind of public lounge room, where strangers found what Eliasson calls “we-ness”: a sense of shared humanity, which seems to be forming here, too.I’d first heard about this sun a few days earlier, when I sat down with Eliasson and the exhibition’s curator Geraldine Kirrihi Barlow. “When you move, it moves. So the sun is asking you to notice that your presence makes a difference,” Eliasson told me. “It holds up in front of you the fact that your actions have consequences.”Eliasson views the audience as “active co-producers” of his work. What you see depends on where you’re looking from; a reminder that we don’t all see the world the same way. One of two new works in the show that uses the polarisation of light, titled Your Negotiable Vulnerability Seen From Two Perspectives (2025), also shifts as you do. Black becomes white; vibrant colours flare.View image in fullscreenDetail of Your Negotiable Vulnerability Seen From Two Perspectives (2025).Photograph: Ágoston Horanyi/Studio Olafur EliassonView image in fullscreenBeauty (1993).Photograph: Ela Bialkowska, OKNOstudioIn Beauty (1993), something as ordinary as dripping water becomes a transcendent experience. It’s not magic – just a curtain of tiny droplets and a light set at the right angle – but it feels like it. The water almost floats, like a thin veil between this world and another. Stand in the right place and a rainbow appears.Presence turns the gallery into a kind of Tardis, each turn opening into something unexpected. Many rooms are dimly lit; one is so dark an attendant reminds me to give my eyes time to adjust. Others are so bright they feel antiseptic.View image in fullscreenFirefly City (2025).Photograph: Jens Ziehe/PhotographieEliasson grew up between Denmark andIceland, attending school in Copenhagen and spending holidays with his grandparents in the Icelandic countryside. The primordial landscapes captivated him in ways many locals, who saw them every day, struggled to understand.His photographs of Iceland anchor the exhibition in a reality that is both beautiful and confronting. Like Australia, Iceland is experiencing huge climatic changes. TheGlacier Melt series – 30 pairs of photographs taken two decades apart, in 1999 and 2019 – shows a disturbing difference.View image in fullscreenGeraldine Kirrihi Barlow and Olafur Eliasson stand in Riverbed (2014) at Goma.Photograph: Jason O’Brien/AAPRiverbed, acquired by Goma following2019’s Water exhibition, takes on a new meaning in this context. Deliberately designed to confuse the eye, it features a trickle of water snaking through the rocky landscape; it is what will remain when the glaciers are gone.Eliasson hopes we can find the courage to “become un-numb” to this reality. “The collapse is now. The collapse is our inability to deal with the way it is collapsing,” he says.He rejects the idea that nature created inside a gallery – like Riverbed – is fundamentally different to nature outside: “There is no outside and inside. There is only the world. The gallery is inside of what is outside. You don’t step into a gallery to disappear into the void. You go in to see more clearly; to see things which outside are contaminated and politicised and weaponised.”He despairs for the world, but Eliasson ultimately calls himself a “prisoner of hope”. He speaks about Indigenous philosophies that view nature as kin, and themovement to grant legal “personhood” rights to natural featuressuch as mountains, rivers and forests. He is heartened by these shifts away from the anthropocentric worldview: “It’s comforting to know people have the capacity to change how they see things.”View image in fullscreenEliasson’s The Cubic Structural Evolution Project.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianPresence attempts to offer both awareness and agency – not by providing answers, but by fostering a sense of connectedness and possibility. Visitors can sit side by side to create a collective dream city using 500,000 pieces of white Lego, Eliasson’s 2004 work The Cubic Structural Evolution Project. “We’re thinking, how do we spark off each other, and dream, and make a city where energy, materials and creativity cycle in different ways?” explains Barlow, Qagoma’s head of international art.From man babies to giant pregnant women: star sculptor Ron Mueck’s larger than life Sydney exhibitionRead moreAs part of the planning process for Presence, Barlow spent two months with Studio Olafur Eliasson – a unique undertaking for both artist and curator. She admires the ecosystem of experimentation among the 90-odd team, which includes architects, craftsmen, historians and specialised technicians. Eliasson would ask Barlow: “Where am I blind? What can you see that I can’t?”“It’s been a lot of fun,” Eliasson tells Barlow. “You take a perspective, then I can go behind you and take your perspective, and mine, and I can hold them up against each other and see the discrepancies.”The generosity underpinning Eliasson’s creative philosophy is also evident in our conversation. We speak for more than an hour – double our allocated time – which is no small feat just two days out from opening. As we wrap, Eliasson smiles and exhales. It’s a physical expression of how he hopes people feel long after they leave Goma.“This gallery, like Iceland, is a place where I can exhale. I don’t have to always be on my heels. I can soften,” he says. “That softening is the currency of tomorrow. That type of tenderness is actually fierce. And that is presence.”Olafur Eliasson: Presenceis at the Gallery of Modern Art (Goma) in Meanjin/Brisbane until 12 July 2026.Explore more on these topicsOlafur EliassonQagoma BrisbaneIcelandClimate crisisArtArt and design booksBrisbanefeaturesShareReuse this content"

We are particularly proud of our commitment to donating them to charity if they don’t need to be returned, so as Christmas approaches, we asked three of our writers where their unwanted items ended up – and who they helped.“The best part of reviewing mattresses isn’t the naps or the lie-ins – it’s the part where someone comes to take them away,” writesJane Hoskyn. “Donating them to my local hardship charityScratchis a win-win: families get to sleep in comfort, and my house gets its floor space back.“Meanwhile, myheated airersare now being used by theYellow Doordomestic abuse refuge in Southampton, and the weighted blankets I tested recently went toSouthampton Hospitals Charity, specifically the Bassett ward for dementia patients.“I also took the chance to comfort myself – afterlosing one beloved pet in 2025and adopting another – by donating toFarplaceanimal rescue, which sold my squishy mountain ofmattress toppersto help fund veterinary care and rehoming. ‘[They] didn’t hang around long,’ says Farplace’s Southampton shop manager, Lucy Wildsmith.“The story that gladdened my heart the most, though, came from Scratch. ‘Our loyal volunteer, J, took one of theartificial Christmas treeshome,’ said volunteer manager Lizzie Osborne. ‘He’s an asylum seeker and has six children, so the whole family will be able to enjoy it.’”Furnishing hopeView image in fullscreenA living room after a Furnishing Futures renovation.Photograph: Kristy Noble“I’ve chosen to donate theair coolers,fansanddehumidifiersI tested this year toFurnishing Futures, a charity based in east London that fully furnishes the empty social housing in which women and children are placed after surviving domestic abuse,” saysCaramel Quin.“It was founded by Emily Wheeler, who has more than 20 years’ experience in frontline social work. She has worked closely with women and children experiencing multiple disadvantages alongside the combined challenges of severe domestic abuse, poor housing and inequality.“She is also a trained interior designer, writer and stylist. She’s combined her two careers in this charity, cutting industry waste by repurposing items that have been used once, briefly, in photoshoots. Meanwhile, the families Furnishing Futures works with feel safe and cared for, with new homes that are beautiful, not just bearable.“‘Good-quality fans and coolers can literally be a life saver, especially for young children and babies,’ says Wheeler. ‘Damp and mould are also huge issues in poor-quality housing, so dehumidifiers help reduce the likelihood of dangerous black mould. It can be devastating when precious belongings get ruined by damp and mould, compounding families’ distress at an already difficult time, so products like these are really welcome.’”Hooked on a felineView image in fullscreenFive of Pete’s Cat Action Trust 1977 foster cats: Wilbur, Elsie, Sidney, Winnie and Rufus.

Acting on tipoffs from the public, they track down stray cats (formerly pets) and feral cats (born wild), then trap, vaccinate and spay them. Some are then fostered and put up for adoption, while others are released safely.“I’m glad we’ve been able to contribute to the Leeds branch. Local vets provide their services at a discount, but thecost of caring for cats (often found in poor health) is staggering.“One easy way to help is bydonating. But if you have a little time and love going spare, perhaps you could go one better and adopt a cat from your local rescue. It will be the making of you both.”If this inspires you, do consider donating any unwanted Christmas gifts, too.

The result was a national award for his pizza and a surprising surge in confidencePaula CocozzaMon 8 Dec 2025 01.55 ESTShareWhen his kimchi fiorentina pizza won a national award, Rich Baker knew he was turning a corner. It was 2023. Baker was 60. He and his wife, Sarah, had made the kimchi themselves and their win put Flat Earth Pizzas, the east London restaurant they had launched the previous year, on the map.“My life has changed so much,” Baker says. “A lightbulb has lit up inside and given me energy, and that energy has given me something that is quite amazing: a sense of confidence and a sense of fulfilment.”Three years ago, when they opened, times were hard. “The first year was absolute hell,” says Baker, and he contemplated putting the business into receivership. But this year, it became profitable. “I work in the kitchen every day and create recipes, and it’s a real inspiration to me.“For 30 years, I thought: ‘I wish I could do my own thing.’ But I never had the strength of character,” he says. “I was too scared. And then we did it.”Baker left school at 16. He was into heavy metal and had long hair, and his abiding memory of sixth form, in Essex, was of the deputy head saying to him: “What an unpleasant surprise to see you back here.” The next day, Baker left. “And, as you do when you leave with no qualifications, I got a job in a restaurant.”He liked cooking and enrolled on a national diploma in hospitality operations. Kitchen work, bar work and housekeeping in restaurants and hotels took him through his late teens and early 20s.“I felt put down at school,” he says. “Not good enough.” But in hospitality: “I found something I really enjoyed. People saw a big change in my personality.”He had always been shy, but when he worked in a hotel in Bournemouth, his friends visited. They played pool, ate fillet steaks, and were impressed. “Subconsciously, it meant something to me that I had value,” Baker says.Now, he thinks: “The real value of hospitality is giving people a lovely time and working with lovely people and suppliers. Hospitality is the backbone of our country in a lot of respects.”View image in fullscreen‘Age shouldn’t hold you back’ … Baker outside his east London restaurant.Photograph: Courtesy of Rich BakerBaker worked his way up from kitchen porter to management. For 30 years, he “went from chain to chain” – Grand Metropolitan hotels, Taylor Walker pubs, Frankie & Benny’s, Costa, Garfunkel’s – and for 10 of those years, he was running airport concessions.“It was draining. Loads of driving, wearing a suit. It took a toll on everything. I just couldn’t cope.” One day, he knocked on his twin brother’s door and said: “I’m going to live with you.” He left the hospitality sector, got divorced and bought a narrowboat. He was in his early 50s.“The boat was so small, it stripped me of all the things I didn’t need. It was invigorating. You’re in the underbelly of London – you’re in London, but you’re below the surface. People ignore you.”He moored all over the city, as well as farther afield, in Bishop’s Stortford, not far from where he grew up. “The River Stort is beautiful. You’re in tune with nature.”He began to think about “putting English ingredients on to pizza”, foraging for nettles, chestnuts, chickweed, elderflowers and berries, initially as toppings for flatbreads. He and Sarah became a couple a year after he moved on to the boat, and they started making their own balsamic vinegar and pickled cherry tomatoes. The boat filled up with Kilner jars. They bought a tiny pizza oven, small-farm English cheeses and heritage grains for the dough, and started a pop-up pizza place in a pub in Hackney, east London, making their way back to the boat each night to light the fire and go to bed at one in the morning.In 2022, they opened Flat Earth, which has a seasonal menu and uses locally sourced produce. “I thought: ‘Let’s do things, and throw caution to the wind.’“We wanted to do something great and meaningful and wholesome, and put it on a plate – and for people to understand it, to enjoy it.“I’m standing up all day, lifting 25kg bags of flour. I’ve got a strong left arm where I’m rolling all these dough balls,” Baker says. “But age shouldn’t hold you back. People in their 60s have so much life experience. I’m learning stuff every day. I’ve got so much more I can do.”Tell us: has your life taken a new direction after the age of 60?Explore more on these topicsLife and styleA new start after 60RestaurantsFoodPizzaHospitality industryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Behind it, the mountains rise gently, their outlines caressed by the sun. The colours of autumn frame the 15th-century frescoes that embellish the structure’s interior, painted by Italian artist Aimone Duce, of the Lombard school. The chapel is the municipality’s oldest religious building, serving about 4,000 inhabitants, and stands on the site of a pre-existing building dating back to 1037.Inside the small chapel, my footsteps echo softly against the walls, breaking the stillness of the surrounding countryside. The sharp scent of plaster mingles with the earthy smell of the fields outside, carried in on the wind along with the sweetness of wheat. Light filters through the narrow windows, catching the vivid hues of a fresco that depicts the seven deadly sins – a theme often revisited in medieval iconography.View image in fullscreenMy eye is drawn to the back wall, where the Deposition (Christ being taken down from the cross) unfolds above the altar and, higher up, the Annunciation appears in delicate contrast. Together, the frescoes meditate on human nature, its vices, frailty and moral struggle. For this reason, the chapel is regarded as one of the finest examples of the Italian international gothic style.Santa Maria di Missione is part of an open culture circuit, theCultura a Porte Aperte, a system created by the Council for Ecclesiastical Cultural Heritage of Piedmont and Valle d’Aosta, and the Fondazione CRT. The goal is to make sacred art accessible through a free app. Once it is downloaded, visitors can book and visit the various churches registered in the system via smartphone, opening the door with a simple QR code near the main entrance.The churches were almost always closed. Sometimes I would set off to visit them, and the challenge was to find the keyMore than 70 churches and chapels have been made accessible through the project, and on entering them visitors can activate a multimedia narrative system: a story available in three languages, that provides historical and artistic information about the structure, accompanied by music and directional lighting.“I am particularly struck by the more isolated chapels, located in fields or on the edge of a forest,” says Monsignor Derio Olivero, the bishop of Pinerolo, a small town 25 miles (40km) south-west of Turin. “Many are in meadows or among vineyards – a paradise of silence and beauty. For the faithful in the area, the project offers the chance to find a ‘private chapel’ where they can occasionally take refuge. The same is true for non-believers, who can experience it as a place to nurture their spirituality,” he adds.View image in fullscreenThe historic centre of Pinerolo, a municipality in Turin.Photograph: Framarzo/AlamyCultura a Porte Aperte allows visitors to explore the churches independently and freely throughout the year. The organisers have arranged the sites into six itineraries in different regions: Langhe and Roero; Monregalese; Colline Torinesi and Monferrato; Pinerolese and Saluzzese; Canavese and Valle d’Aosta-Via Francigena; Val di Susa-Via Francigena. Olivero says that the intention is to extend the project across Italy, with Lombardy already on board. “We are in contact with Lazio. I think about the impact the project could have when there are 700, or even 1,000 churches.”He explains that the initiative drives regional tourism, attracting local and international visitors. “As a young priest, I was fascinated by small churches; they are rich in 15th-century frescoes, but sometimes abandoned and were almost always closed. Sometimes I would set off to visit them, and the challenge was to find the key, spending hours searching for it.”These are spaces that promote slow tourism, enabling visitors to discover the area, often through word of mouthWhen I reach the small Piedmontese town of Lusernetta, I find the chapel ofSan Bernardino da Siena. Built between 1450 and 1520, it is dedicated to Saint Bernardino, who in 1425 travelled to the Lucerne valleys to convert the Waldensians – a proto-Protestantism community known for its strict adherence to the Bible. The simple interior features a series of frescoes by an anonymous painter known as the “maestro di Lusernetta”. But the Madonna of Mercy and Child by Jacopino Longo on the left wall of the nave stands out: the Madonna, sitting on her throne, shelters the family of the Counts of Luserna di Rorà – who commissioned the work – under her blue mantle.View image in fullscreenFrescoes by Bartolomeo Serra in the chapel of the Santa Lucia delle Vigne, Pinerolo.Photograph: Lavinia NocelliThese small churches are maintained by parish volunteers. “These are spaces that promote slow tourism, enabling visitors to discover the area, often through word of mouth,” says Luigi Capello, the head of the local parish youth group and coordinator of pastoral activities. “This project allows us to accompany schools, communities and care homes on visits. But we must not forget the importance of human contact. People can visit the churches independently, yet most of those who return ask to meet one of the volunteers – to hear the story in person.”The streets of the historic centre of Pinerolo, a municipality in Turin, are enriched by the aromas of bakeries and florists. Inside the cafes, people quickly exchange a greeting, grab an espresso, and leave. Just off the main street is the chapel ofSanta Lucia delle Vigne, surrounded by vineyards. Inside are frescoes painted in the 15th century by Bartolomeo Serra and his workshop, depicting four episodes from the saint’s life. Six small wooden cubes serve as benches inside: dim light enters through the window, illuminating Saint Lucia’s face, which looks at the viewer from every side of the nave. The silence is broken only by the narrator’s voice describing the painted scenes. “It’s almost like talking directly to the painter,” says Roberto Billia, a volunteer. “When the door opens, like a miracle, the lights come on and the recording starts. It’s magnificent.”Explore more on these topicsItaly holidaysCultural tripsTurin holidaysEurope holidaysArtRoad tripsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Anything from a hard candy to a candied fruit can qualify as a “sugar plum” and, in the case of these cookies, the sugar plum is represented by theamarena cherry. Coffee’s bitterness balances the sweetness of the fruit and the rich butteriness of the dough, while the oat flour adds a dash of shortbread-like delicateness.Sugar plum and coffee cookiesPrep10 minChill30 min+Cook35 min,plus coolingMakes36185g room-temperature butter75g sugar2 tsp instant coffee/espresso powder1 tsp unsweetened cocoa powderFinely grated zest of½ lemon½ tsp vanilla extract⅛ tsp fine salt180g plain flour85g oat flour36 amarena cherries in syrupTurbinado sugar, or pearl sugar or icing sugar, for dippingIn the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the butter, sugar, coffee powder, cocoa, lemon zest, vanilla and salt, at first on low and then medium speed, until creamy and fluffy.Add both flours and beat just until combined with no dry flour remaining; don’t overbeat because this can toughen the texture. (Alternatively, this can be done with a hand mixer or wooden spoon.) Compress the dough into a mass, cover the bowl tightly (or transfer it to an airtight container) and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes and up to 48 hours.Heat the oven to 190C (175C fan)/375F/gas 5 and line two 33cm x 46cm baking trays with greaseproof paper. Line a large plate with two layers of kitchen towel and, using a slotted spoon or fork, put the cherries on it – the paper towels will absorb most of their excess liquid. Put some cold water in a small bowl and your preferred decorating sugar(s) in another small bowl (or bowls, if using multiple sugars).Divide the chilled dough into 36 equal pieces of about 15g each, then roll each one between your palms to make 2½cm balls. Arrange these evenly in three rows of six on each of the lined trays.To form the craters that will welcome the cherries, press an index finger into the centre of each ball close to the bottom to create a dimple. A little cracking is OK, but if any large cracks form, smooth them much as you would clay. If your crater-forming finger is sticking to the dough, lightly dip it into the bowl of cold water (shake off any excess) before pressing it into the dough.Press the top of each cookie into the decorating sugar(s) to coat evenly and plentifully, then return them to the baking tray. Gently nestle a cherry into each cookie crater, then bake for 13-14 minutes; the cookies will expand slightly and have tiny cracks, and the cherries may be lightly bubbling.Let the cookies cool on the trays on cooling racks. Once cooled completely, store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to two weeks.Brian Levy is the author ofthe Formal Assignment newsletterand Good & Sweet, published by Avery at £35.99.

The Kenya-based WorldPath House of Travel, with more than 20,000 followers on the social media platform, promised hassle-free work visas for jobs across Europe.“They were showing work permits they’d received, envelopes, like: ‘We have Europe visas already,’” Lilian recalls.After transferring a deposit of 150,000 Kenyan shillings (£870) – one year’s savings – Lilian received a document with the letterhead of a Netherlands-based recruitment agency, Undutchables, offering her the role of “fruits and vegetable sorter” in Amsterdam.But WorldPath House of Travel is not registered with Kenya’sNational Employment Authority. And its supposed partnership with Undutchables is nonexistent, the agency’s general manager, Nick van der Dussen, confirmed, calling WorldPath’s recruitment effort a “scam”.View image in fullscreenAn advert for WorldPath House Of Travel.Photograph: FacebookAs the months dragged on, Lilian realised she had been duped. WorldPath ignored her repeated requests for a refund and claimed its phone number was out of service, according to messages seen by the Guardian.WorldPath is far from the only unregistered recruiter on TikTok. The Guardian identified more than a dozen agencies that are not accredited with the Kenyan government, as they are legally required to be, but which are using the platform to promote warehouse, factory, hospitality and security work around the world. Several accounts linked to alleged scams have since been deleted and apparently restarted under new usernames.Six Kenyans who lost money to such agencies have shared their stories with the Guardian. They paid between 100,000 and 545,000 Kenyan shillings to recruiters, selling their cattle, taking out bank loans and borrowing from family and friends to cover commission fees for jobs that never materialised.The recruiters on TikTok wentto great lengths to convince job seekers of their legitimacy, in one case proffering falsified documents from a Toronto hospital and Canadian immigration authorities, and setting up fake interviews with purported employers in others.“When you’re desperate, you tend to fall for things easily,” says one jobless Kenyan who has not yet told their family they lost more than 350,000 Kenyan shillings to an agency advertising on TikTok. “The office was good, in a good building, nice location, well arranged, several staff – I got the idea that this is something that is good.”View image in fullscreenA young man walks through Nairobi’s Kibera slum, the largest in Africa. Youth unemployment across Kenya is at nearly 17%.Photograph: Donwilson Odhiambo/Getty ImagesKenya’s economy is stagnant, with the World Bank estimating youth unemployment ofnearly 17%and a cost of living crisis thatfuelled mass protestslast year. The Kenyan government is facilitating labour export to address unemployment and strengthen its economy through remittances. It plans to placeone million of its nationals annuallyin jobs abroad.In the meantime, many Kenyans are taking their job search to TikTok. About62%of the population now uses the platform, according to the Reuters Institute, up from54%two years ago.At least one TikToker has faced criminal charges. In March, Maria Kamunge, popularly known as Rish Kamunge,appeared in courtaccused of soliciting money from dozens of Kenyans for bogus foreign jobs. She denied the charges.Local media reportedthat she closed her offices in Kenya.In May, Kenya’s Ministry of Labour and Social Protectionreleaseda list of more than 30 blacklisted agencies and said it was investigating more than 150 more amid accusations of illegal recruitment practices.But agencies that are not on Kenya’s public list of registered recruiters have continued to proliferate on TikTok.Halisi Affiliates, which Kenyan business records show was founded in December 2023, used the platform to advertise jobs across Europe and North America as an unregistered recruiter.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toGlobal DispatchFree newsletterGet a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features, opinion and photography, curated by our global development teamEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But the sisters grew suspicious during Zoom calls with Halisi and more than 50 other Kenyans who received the same offer, according to screenshots of a meeting. Some had been waiting for months with no update.The sisters demanded their money back, but discovered Halisi had closed down its office and social media.Another jobseeker, Sylvia Wairimu Maina, 31, says she paid Halisi a deposit of 100,000 Kenyan shillings in September 2024 for an assistant nursing role in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, arranged through Halisi’s British partner, Global Employment Consultant, according to documents and messages shared with the Guardian.Halisi and Global Employment Consultant blamed one another for months-long delays, Maina says, and she never received a refund. Because she quit her caregiving job for the promised move, the experience left her with “no money, no savings”.“It was devastating,” says Maina. “And very draining.”Global Employment Consultant is not registered under UK business records, nor do any registrations containing “GEC” match its activities or address, which its website lists as a residential London building with an incorrect postcode.‘I broke completely’: how jobseekers from Africa are being tricked into slavery in Asia’s cyberscam compoundsRead moreIn November 2024, as Maina and Nimo’s families began questioning the delays of their placements, four of Halisi’s five founding officers registered a new company called Fly With Halisi, records show.By September this year, a Fly With Halisi account on TikTok came online, using a tweaked version of the Halisi Affiliates logo. A Facebook account appeared a month later.In a statement, Halisi told the Guardian it was “a victim of fraud by an overseas third-party partner” in Romania and that it left TikTok “to allow for internal review and cooperation with Kenyan authorities”, including filing a police report, refunding several clients and facilitating jobs for two people. It said its office closure was “not an attempt to evade clients”.The company denied any connection to the new TikTok account, but did not answer follow-up questions about its offices’ new business with the same name, or Maina’s case.TikTok did not respond to multiple requests for comment, including a list of the accounts tracked by the Guardian.

It is a strong antioxidant, helping protect cells from harmful unstable compounds that arise from toxins and pollution. It helps the body absorb iron, and is also used in the production of collagen. “But the idea that taking high doses of vitamin C – or drinking lots of orange juice – will stop you catching a cold, or help you recover faster, is a myth.”Davis, the author ofSelf Defence: A Myth-Busting Guide to Immune Health,explains that the popular belief in vitamin C’s cold-fighting powers has persisted for more than 50 years, “pretty much solely because of the evangelical view of one man: Linus Pauling”.While supplementation may slightly reduce symptom duration, the effect is modestA double Nobel prize winner and one of the most influential chemists of the 20th century, Pauling made a major contribution to our understanding of vitamins. However, he exaggerated vitamin C’s benefits. Pauling’s 1970 book Vitamin C and the Common Cold became a bestseller, explains Davis, sparking such high demand that factories were built to keep up with supplement production.In truth,research showsthat people who take vitamin C supplements are just as likely to catch a cold as those who don’t. And while supplementation may slightly reduce symptom duration (by about 8% in adults) the effect is modest.“It’s also difficult to interpret that data,” says Davis, “because people who regularly take high doses of vitamin C are often more health-conscious in general.”Instead, he recommends focusing on vitamin D if you want to fight off sickness. “It is much more clearly established as important for immune health,” he says. Vitamin D is available from exposure to sunlightbetween March and October, but the NHS suggests that during winter people may want to take it as a supplement.Explore more on these topicsAlternative medicineIs it true that …HealthHealth & wellbeingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I value my meals and the work that has gone into them, so I am now always prepared and ready to take home delicious leftoversDhruti ShahMon 8 Dec 2025 05.00 ESTShareI’ve always loved catching up with friends and family over a meal out. Not only is it a chance to find out the latest gossip and what everyone’s up to, but it’s also an opportunity to try out new foods and share that experience together.But looking back, I’ve realised that I’ve been guilty of contributing to food waste by leaving meals unfinished. Sometimes, I didn’t realise how big portions would be or I’d get so focused on chatting to everyone that I would forget to eat everything until it was time to go.Just before the pandemic, I decided things had to change and started taking my own takeaway box with me. It debuted at my yearly birthday afternoon tea with friends. I wanted to get my money’s worth and bring my dessert home, as I had always struggled to finish off my puddings. I’d also read how1.05bn tonnes of food was wasted in a yearand this was my chance to do something small.Growing up in a vegetarian Gujarati Jain Kenyan-Indian family, leaving food on your plate – whether you were out for dinner or at home – was unthinkable. Waste simply wasn’t an option. Anything left over would be taken home for the next day’s lunch or repurposed into a new dish. It didn’t matter what it was. My parents worked multiple jobs for us to be able to afford this food, so we understood and appreciated it had to be eaten.View image in fullscreenDhruti Shah, at a Beauty and the Beast-themed afternoon tea.Photograph: Courtesy of Dhruti ShahFor some weird reason, if I was out with friends, it was a different story. Maybe I didn’t want to draw attention to myself. I don’t drink alcohol or eat meat – I didn’t want to break even more conventions in these social settings, so I suppose I was trying to fit in.Now, my little box goes everywhere with me, whether it’s a meal out, a work function or even an overseas event. I’ve had to overcome the embarrassment of saying I’d like to take the food home and that I’ve got my own box. The staff are usually very accommodating and it’s a bit of a conversation starter; sometimes diners at the neighbouring tables become intrigued and we start chatting. It makes me happy that I’m helping the planet in my own way and I want to show my appreciation for those who create the food by not leaving it behind. As a freelancer, I’ve also got to be careful with how I spend my money.My friend Lorna always laughs when I reach into my bag at the end of one of our lunches or dinners out together as she knows exactly what’s about to happen. Other friends are also starting to bring their own box to restaurants, inspired by mine. We’re even sharing our pictures and tips about what to do with the food the next day in our group chat.For me, this change isn’t just about reducing food waste but also understanding it’s OK to be different in social environments. I can ask to take my food home with me and nobody minds. And it makes me proud that I’m following in the footsteps of my ever resourceful parents. My friends and I are creating our own mini movement, reducing food waste one box at a time.Explore more on these topicsFood wasteThe one change that workedRestaurantsFoodfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The forgotten Dutch invention that created the modern worldThe answer to today’s engineering challengeAlex BellosMon 8 Dec 2025 12.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 8 Dec 2025 15.26 ESTShareEarlier today I asked you to reinvent a component of the sixteenth century Dutch sawmill, which – according to anew book– was the world’s first industrial machine.You can read that post here,along with some great BTL discussion about the world’s greatest inventions. (Spoon or spear? Plough or spectacles? Transistor or trousers?)Round and upDesign a machine that turns rotary motion to up-and-down motion. You have these items only: A rotating disc. Two pins. Two rods. A “guide”, which is a cylinder or sleeve into which one of the rods will fit perfectly. (Assume you can put things on a stand, so the components don’t fall down.)SolutionThere are many ways to convert rotary to linear motion, but the example here is perhaps the most simple. Pin one end of a rod to the discanywhereapart from the centre of the disc, and pin the other end of the rod to a second rod in a guide that is pointing in any direction. (UPDATE: The direction must be away from the disc.)View image in fullscreenIllustration: Jaime DávilaThe illustration shows the wheel turning anticlockwise. As it moves around, it pulls the rod down and then pushes it up.In the Dutch sawmill, inventor Cornelis Corneliszoon converted rotary motion from a windmill into linear motion in two ways: to push a log horizontally along a carriage, and to push a blade vertically down onto the log. As a result the Dutch built many boats, became a great trading nation, and established the settlement that eventually became New York.I hope you enjoyed the puzzle.

Vodafone’s narrative around its benevolent gesture towards the Howe family was also interrogated, with the family beginning to suspect that there might have been serious problems with Howe’s plan to run a pair of the telecoms group’s franchise stores.These feelings were exacerbated as it emerged last year that the £18bn company was fighting ahigh court claim brought by 62 of its former franchisees who allege Vodafone “unjustly enriched” itself by slashing commissions– a caseMPs have comparedto the Post Office Horizon IT scandal.Vodafone says the legal claim is a “commercial dispute” but has apologised to claimants who blamedpressure from the telecoms group for triggering suicidal thoughts. A survey of franchisees during September 2020 resulted in 78 out of 119 respondents leavingoverwhelmingly critical comments about the effects Vodafone’s actions had had on their mental health.“At the time [of Howe’s death] it looked like [Vodafone was] being generous and helpful, but then you get to thinking the complete opposite,” Holmes says now. “To me, that has guilty conscience written all over it.”Franchise fearsIn July 2018, Howe had seemed excited. A year earlier Vodafone had begun to free itself from running its own retail network by transferring shops to franchisees – many of whom were former staff members.The policy resulted inalmost all of Vodafone’s 400-plus UK retail estatebeing converted into franchises – where individuals set up small businesses, with their own profit and loss accounts, to sell Vodafone products and services in return for commission payments.View image in fullscreenAdrian Howe felt he had no option other than to become a franchisee.Photograph: SuppliedBut the thrills for Howe of starting a new company were also tinged with anxiety, his relatives recall. The shopkeeper fretted he lacked the savings to fund his new venture, leaving his pension savings as the only buffer for costs such as salaries and rent. He also felt he had no option other than to become a franchisee, as the alternative was taking a less secure role working for whatever other startup franchise took on the store where he worked.As he prepared for his new career in the summer of 2018, these fears were raised in family conversations and with Vodafone – but furtively, as Howe opened up only to a single relative at a time.His sister Gillian knew her brother’s house would be on the line as part of a personal guarantee he was giving to Vodafone to seal the franchise deal. But she was unaware that Howe had failed to mention this detail to his wife, Tracey.Meanwhile, family members were becoming aware that Howe felt cornered. His eldest son, Dan, says he was told by his father in August 2018 that “Vodafone has me by the balls”. Youngest son, Nathan, recalls days later marking his 18th birthday at a local pub with his father, and being told: “This pint might have saved me”.Odd as Howe’s siloed comments seemed, they did not appear overly concerning at the time. Then, the day after Nathan’s birthday celebrations, Howe took a bicycle ride and veered into oncoming traffic.“To me, that was his first attempt,” Dan says.Store strugglesHaving been discharged from hospital after the cycling incident, Howe began opening up about the pressures he was feeling. He only wanted to operate a single shop in Irvine, but he had been told by Vodafone that he needed to take on a second in Kilmarnock, his family recall being told.But Howe had worked in that Kilmarnock store and knew it struggled. If he couldn’t turn the performance around, his personal guarantee risked proving ruinous. Vodafone denies it ever put pressure on anybody into taking challenging shops, although others have different memories of that time. “Vodafone [was] making it impossible to have only one store,” Holmes suggests.The stores were to open on 2 September 2018 and the clock was running down. In the early hours of 27 August, with wife Tracey working a night shift, Howe left the house on foot, despite having severe bruising and seven stitches in his left calf caused by his cycling incident.The father of five’s body was found at about 8am by a local dog walker in a lake, a 24-minute walk from his home.There was no suicide note, but Howe’s family is certain that the pressure he felt from becoming a franchisee drove him to take his own life. They point to the gentle incline leading down to the water where his body was discovered, plus Howe’s jacket and keys found nearby, all of which seems to rule out a fall. An impromptu swim appears far-fetched, given the hour, an outside temperature of no more than 15C (59F) and the fact Howe was wearing most of his clothes.Vodafone “wholly rejects” any suggestion that it “knowingly or recklessly or negligently” put anybody involved with its franchise stores under unreasonable pressure, while mental health experts emphasise that suicide is usually complex and can often involve many triggers.View image in fullscreenVodafone ‘wholly rejects’ any suggestion that it ‘knowingly or recklessly or negligently’ put anybody involved with its franchise stores under unreasonable pressure.Photograph: Maureen McLean/ShutterstockThe postmortem report hinted at other potential factors such as heart disease and stated that Howe had a “history of anxiety and depression (1995)”. But his relatives say that specific mental health episode was short-lived and never recurred. The forensic pathologist went on to state Howe had “been ‘a bit stressed’ due to setting up a new business” as she concluded his death was “consistent with drowning”.Whatever drove Howe to enter the water that morning, the official documents seem to make clear that Howe’s mind was preoccupied with much more than the normal strains of opening a new business. That looming deadline appeared to be weighing heavily enough to prompt a foreboding entry in a notepad discovered at his home: “1st September nice to have death,” the postmortem report stated Howe wrote, in an apparent reference to the stores’ scheduled opening the following day.“Only now do I realise what he’s done and the enormity of what he’s done,” said Tracey, who has come to the view that her husband took his own life as he became convinced he risked financial devastation as a franchisee. “It’s atrocious to see what happened to all the 62 [high court claimants]. They can hopefully rebuild. We’ll never be able to rebuild. He’s gone forever”.‘Untenable’ lossesThe 62 high court claimants allege Vodafone “unjustly enriched itself” at their expense when the company suddenly slashed their sales commissions in 2020. Depending on which side’s figures you believe, the legal battle is being fought over the franchisees’ claim of between £78m and £85m in compensation, down from an initial filing seeking £120m.Among them is Rachael Beddow-Davison, a 44-year-old single mother of three who ran a trio of the brand’s franchise stores in the east of England.One of those, Lincoln, was profitable. But her portfolio was swamped by the losses of two other struggling outlets, Beddow-Davison says from the home she built just a 30-minute stroll from Skegness’ seafront, where her second shop was only ever financially viable during the summer season. And, then, there was her third store.“Gainsborough, it never made a penny. It was in a loss every single month. So whatever profit you’re making in [Lincoln] it’s actually been reduced, so it’s untenable.”In echoes of the Howe case, Beddow-Davison says she only agreed to take the struggling Gainsborough store because Vodafone pledged to underwrite its losses, but soon felt those promises had been forgotten and that Vodafone relied on inaccurate data used to measure franchisees’ performance.The cuts to sales commissions in the summer of 2020 – which the high court claimants allege slashed their key revenue streams “by over 40%” while leaving them with fixed costs such as rent and salaries – compounded Beddow-Davison’s financial woes. She also feared the company was plotting to strip her of her financial crutch: the profitable store in Lincoln. It was all getting too much.“Who I was in 2018 to who I was in ‘22 [was] two totally different people. I was paranoid.”“They used to slag all the partners off to me [saying]: ‘We’re going to take their stores,’” she recalls. “I didn’t know who I could trust. My worst fear was losing the children’s home. It’s [on] my family land. At that point, I thought, well, it’d be easier if I was gone.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Writing with an eerie calm, her email outlined how Vodafone’s promises relating to the Gainsborough store had “never been upheld”, that her franchise business had lost more than £80,000 in the previous 10 months and that she had to “exit Vodafone immediately”.“This is causing me severe stress and anxiety to the point where I attempted to take my own life last night,” she wrote matter-of-factly. She signed off: “I am a true advocate for Vodafone.”Beddow-Davison then waited for a response. And then she waited some more. Almost three hours later, Vodafone had still not replied. “Can you confirm that the below email was received please?” she asked, almost apologetically.When Vodafone did reply, it was not to let her go. Beddow-Davison says the company persuaded her to stay as a franchisee – only to then threaten to terminate their agreement a year later citing “poor performance”. She is adamant that she has had no previous mental health issues – while Vodafone insists it put no undue pressure on anybody running its stores.“I used to tell [a succession of Vodafone area managers] that somebody is going to kill themselves. I was really lucky, but somebody will die. And I said, ‘I want you to know that [a colleague] Dan is in hospital because of the stress, but you’re choosing to do nothing about it’.”‘I could feel something was changing’Dan Attwal was a Vodafone star.He had joined the company in 2014 running the brand’s Birmingham city centre stores before being transferred to take a similar role in Sheffield’s Meadowhall shopping centre and then becoming a franchisee.“In 2019 I was stood in the middle of the NEC at the Franchise Roadshow encouraging people to join [Vodafone’s programme],” he says. “I’ve championed the brand significantly, I’ve been part of the franchise magazine. I met my wife at Vodafone [but] I could feel something was changing.”Attwal ran Vodafone’s franchise stores in Cannock and Burton but – just like with Howe and Beddow-Davison – he soon felt pressure to take on some more.He describes the circumstances whereby he felt encouraged to take on a third store in his home town of Derby in December 2020. “At that time I was in hospital, having a pacemaker fitted. There was not a chance I’d have taken Derby without promises that I’d have been looked after.”View image in fullscreenDan Attwal says he lost about £250,000 due to his experience as a Vodafone franchise holder.Photograph: Andrew Fox/The GuardianLike Beddow-Davison, Attwal says that Vodafone’s data on the Derby store was incorrect and that these were not the only numbers coming out of the company that looked questionable. He claims that minor transgressions or deviations from operating procedures were harshly penalised.“We appeared on a report and the cost of [our administrative mistake] to Vodafone was £7.08. I [then] sent an email to my [manager] … just to clarify that I was being fined £10,000. And I got an email back to say: ‘Yes, as per policies and procedures, this is the fine that you’ll get.’”Vodafone has said it was not its intention to profit from fines and that it has regulatory obligations in relation to the finances of franchisees, including imposing penalties.For Attwal, it only intensified feelings his business was falling apart. He talks of the moments he imagined taking his own life. But it seems he went further than considering a possible method: peeling back his clothing, he reveals the scar of what appears to have been an actual attempt. “I still can’t believe I’ve done it and what happened,” he says. “Mind-blowing.”“I lost about £250,000, bounceback loans and everything. I was thinking it’s just me [struggling] … they made me believe that.”‘Goodwill’ paymentsHowever, it was not only Attwal or, even just the 62 high court claimants. In September, Vodafone commencedoffering financial settlementsto a selection of former franchisees who are outside the group of claimants currently suing the business – as it launched its fourth investigation into the historical conduct within its franchising division.The €37bn (£33bn) turnover FTSE 100 company did not say how many former franchisees had accepted payments, nor if they had signed non-disclosure agreements as part of those deals, although some cost details have been disclosed. In December 2024, the company admitted to paying £4m of “goodwill” payments, while it also wrote to MPs in October this year and told them a separate £17m of payments had been made to its former partners since the commission rate changes in 2020, covering fixed costs such as high rent and increased energy costs.A Vodafone UK spokesperson said: “While we are sorry if any partners have had a difficult experience, we reject any suggestion that our franchisees were put under undue pressure.“We continue to run a successful franchise operation, and many of our existing franchisees have expanded their business with us by taking on additional stores. We encourage everyone to raise issues, and we will always seek to resolve them, and we remain open to further discussions with claimants to resolve the commercial dispute.”The company added that the payment to the Howe family was “simply trying to do the right thing”.Holmes, whose father died before becoming a franchisee and so is not part of the high court claim, sees things differently. “In the end, when [my dad, Adrian Howe] really needed their help, he was merely a number to them,” she says. “It’s us, as a family, that have had to pay the price.”In the UK and Ireland,Samaritanscan be contacted on freephone 116 123, or emailjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.

Vodafone contacted the Guardian to say that the company had incorrectly described these payments in its letter to MPs as “goodwill” payments - but, in fact they were part of contractual agreements.Explore more on these topicsVodafoneTelecommunications industryCorporate governancefeaturesShareReuse this content"

So removing it and being left with a drink that still tastes good has been a huge challenge for the industry.“No-alcohol beer used to taste terrible because the technology was quite primitive,” Perkins said. “Beer is very delicate; you need to treat it with care, and that ended up affecting the taste. You got beer with no alcohol but it tasted lousy.”But the world has moved on. The de-alcoholisation unit uses state-of-the-art technology that represents a “significant step forward in preserving the full flavour and aroma of the beer”, according to the company.The brew undergoes its metamorphosis inside hulking stainless steel columns, with the alcohol extracted using a process called vacuum distillation. This involves reducing the atmospheric pressure, lowering alcohol’s boiling point and allowing the beer to be heated to a warm temperature to retain taste while evaporating the alcohol.View image in fullscreenChris Bryant, left, formally opens the Magor ‘de-alcoholisation’ facility at Magor in south Wales.Photograph: Budweiser Brewing GroupBy avoiding prolonged exposure to high temperatures, the original character of the tipple (if you are partial to Stella or Corona) is maintained while ensuring it is alcohol-free. Perkins’ view is that the machine “treats the beer very sensitively and delivers a fantastic taste”.From the outside, the news thatAB InBev, the world’s biggest brewer with annual sales of $59.8bn (£44.9bn), is investing in no-alcohol beer might seem like a turkey voting for Christmas, but Perkins calls it a “massive opportunity”.The demand is coming from several places, including drinkers opting for a headache-free Monday-night beer and “zebra stripers” – those alternating between alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks on a night out.View image in fullscreenAB InBev’s Brian Perkins raises a pint with Chris Bryant, the minister for trade policy.Photograph: Budweiser Brewing Group“We don’t see it as a disruptor – we see it as something that’s making the category more inclusive,” he said.With 29 no-alcohol beer brands under its belt, including Corona Cero and Budweiser Zero, in its last quarterly update the brewer said its 0% beers powered a 27% increase in global revenue.The availability of alcohol-free beers on tap in pubs is expected to further normalise the choice. In the summer, Stella Artois 0.0 made its draught debut at Wimbledon and the range is now being trialled at a small number of UK pubs in readiness for a bigger rollout next year.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionThe prize could be big. In 2024, the UK beer market was worth more than £13.5bn, according to the drinks industry data company IWSR. Since 2019, the average annual growth in demand for no-alcohol beer has topped 20% to account for 2% of the market by volume. IWSR predicts this figure will double to 4% in 2029.Susie Goldspink, IWSR’s head of nolo alcohol, said 0% beer was the most dynamic area of the new market. “Innovation levels are high, consumer engagement continues to grow, and there is plenty of headroom for growth,” she said.One gripe from consumers is that alcohol-free beer oftencosts the sameas the heavily taxed real thing. Perkins says it charges a fair price and points to the additional expense involved. “We brew the beer according to the same process, and then add a step and that step has required new capital equipment and millions of dollars,” he said.View image in fullscreenAB InBev’s new de-alcoholisation facility at Magor, south Wales.Photograph: Budweiser Brewing GroupThe $3.9m that the company has poured into the de-alcoholisation facility is small beer in the context of the vast global brewing industry, but Perkins calls it a “significant step” at a time when he senses rivals “pulling back” from investing in the UK. “Magor has long been a centre of innovation … and this facility helps secure its role for the future,” he said.It is not hard to see why competitors might sit on their hands. The hospitality industry is in turmoil as consumers rein in spending at a time when business costs are rising. The government’s decision to raiseemployer national insurance contributionswas unpopular, butthe overhaul of business ratesannounced in the budget has proved the final straw for some.Attending the opening,Chris Bryant, the minister for trade policy, pointed to the business rates help package, which includes £3.2bn in transitional relief (which caps the increase in rates for each year).Bryant said the investment in Magor was “protecting jobs and making sure that we’ve got them into the future. People’s [drinking] habits are changing and that’s why it’s good we’re going to have alcohol-free beer brewed in south Wales, rather than relying on it coming from the Netherlands or Belgium.”Explore more on these topicsAB InBevFood & drink industryBeerAlcoholWalesChris BryantfeaturesShareReuse this content"

You didn’t have to explain why this mattered,” said the 60-year-old Pruszko, as he refreshed those skills at an army base outside Warsaw on a recent frosty Saturday morning. With dozens of other Polish civilians, he toured a bomb shelter, fitted gas masks and practised striking sparks from a flint to start a fire.The training, designed to boost civilian resilience, was part of a new programme that aims to train 400,000 Polish citizens by 2027. The voluntary scheme is open to anyone from schoolchildren to pensioners.“We are living in the most dangerous times since the end of the second world war,” said Poland’s defence minister, Władysław Kosiniak-Kamysz, at the programme’s launch last month. “Each of us must have the skills, knowledge and practical knowhow to cope in a crisis.”There is an acute awareness in Poland of how the country’s geographical location at the centre of Europe has left it historically vulnerable to attack. The full-scale invasion of neighbouring Ukraine in 2022 focused minds, and this yeardrone incursions into Polish airspaceand a wave of sabotage attacks linked to Russian intelligence have added to the alarm. Most recently,a railway line was blown up last month,with authorities claiming Russia organised the attack and had intended to cause casualties.It has all led to an overhaul of national security thinking. The government has approved a draft budget for next year that will raise defence spending to 4.8% of GDP, comfortably higher than almost all other Nato countries. New buildings must be fitted with bomb shelters, and a programme has begun to re-equip older shelters in a state of disrepair. Construction has begun on an “eastern shield” that will run the length of the country’s borders withBelarusand the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad.View image in fullscreenCivilians taking part in training organised by the Polish military.Photograph: Jędrzej Nowicki/The GuardianRevising the war gamesAt a forward operating base a few kilometres from Poland’s border with Belarus, Brig Gen Roman Brudło, the commander of Poland’s 9th armoured cavalry brigade, said Russia’s invasion of Ukraine completely changed the security picture for Poland.“The quiet times have unfortunately passed, and we are living in a difficult time, in very dynamic times,” he said, in an interview at his field office, located inside a container at the base. “I read the papers, I hear the news, I see the analysis made by different intelligence communities, which are saying that in one, two, five years we will have the possibility to face a full-scale invasion from Russia. I don’t know. I hope not.”View image in fullscreenBrig Gen Roman Brudło: ‘I think [Russia] will put pressure on us in a hybrid way.’Photograph: Jędrzej Nowicki/The GuardianBrudło joined the army back in 1996, he said, because he was a trained mechanic and “loved tanks”. After nearly three decades serving, which has included rotations with allied forces in Iraq and Afghanistan, he admitted that in a war against drones or sabotage threats, his training in traditional warfare would need to be revised.“I’m not tied to the tank, I am not glued to it, and everybody here also went through training preparing us for new kinds of tasks,” he said. “I think [Russia] will put pressure on us in a hybrid way, below the threshold of the war, to make us tired, but not to cross the level when we unite.”Capt Karol Frankowski, who works in communications for the brigade, recounted how, over the summer, he spent a month at Nato’s annual Saber Junction exercises in Germany, wargaming along with soldiers from more than a dozen countries. The scenario involved a hybrid attack from an unspecified attacker, which caused law and order to break down and martial law to be implemented.“My job was to make contact with the locals during the crisis – they had actors playing the chief of police, local journalists, other citizens – and we had to act like it was martial law,” he said.One of Russia’s hybrid tactics, according to Brudło and Frankowski, is the encouragement of “illegal migration” on Europe’s borders. The brigade’s current role is to help border guards detect people attempting to cross into Poland, and thus the Schengen zone, from Belarus. Sensors along the border wall alert the soldiers to any attempts to cross. The day before the Guardian visited, the soldiers said they had apprehended a man from Afghanistan, who would most likely be returned to Belarus.“For the protection of our country, this is a necessity. We don’t know who this Afghan guy is. Maybe a spy or maybe some kind of person who wants to destroy our country from the inside. Maybe he’s even a Russian spy,” said Frankowski.The idea that Moscow and Minsk are weaponising migration was used by the previous, nationalist government as the basis for a violent crackdown on migrants who crossed the border ever since the crisis began in 2020. Strikingly, since Donald Tusk’s progressive coalition took over two years ago, little has changed.The focus on the threat from Russia has even led many liberals, who were previously outraged by the brutal treatment of asylum seekers at the border, to get on board with the government’s tough policies, said Aleksandra Chrzanowska, part of the Grupa Granica alliance of activists and rights workers. “The drama and the tragedy of those who are coming here to seek protection is not interesting to people any more,” she said.Chrzanowska said national security was important, but called the focus on migrants as a threat a “far-right, racist narrative” that was not based in fact. She and other activists are now lonely voices speaking out for the human rights of those attempting to cross. The debate on migration in Poland, as in so many European countries, has shifted far to the right, and here the supposed link between migration and Russia makes the rhetoric all the more powerful.View image in fullscreenSoldiers on patrol at the border with Belarus.Photograph: Jędrzej Nowicki/The GuardianReady to fightIn addition to the border wall, constructed by the previous government along much of the border with Belarus, the new “eastern shield” will involve trenches and fortifications along the length of the Belarus and Kaliningrad borders, to create a barrier against potential invasion.But if war does come, it is most likely not to be the traditional kind that sees tanks rolling across the border. The shield will also include GPS towers and other technological installations, to protect against drone incursions.In Gołdap, a town of about 15,000 people just a few kilometres from the border with Kaliningrad, locals were sanguine about having Russia on their doorstep. “The threat does influence the way you think, but to be honest I’d be more worried if I were living in Warsaw. Strategically, they’re not going to be targeting us here,” said Piotr Bartoszuk, 45, head of Gołdap’s vocational college.In the early 2000s, local people would cross the border regularly, he said. Poles filled up with cheaper Russian petrol; the Russians took shopping or sightseeing trips. Now, the border is closed; buildings that once housed a bar and exchange booth lie abandoned and overgrown with long grass.“Russia is definitely a threat, but not a huge one, because we’re in Nato, we’re protected, and I don’t think they’d just come at us out of the blue, the way they did with Ukraine,” said 15-year-old Kornelia Brzezińska, who hopes to join the army and is studying in the military track at the college.View image in fullscreenKornelia Brzezińska: ‘I wouldn’t abandon our nation – I’d defend it.’Photograph: Jędrzej Nowicki/The GuardianIf the country were to be attacked, however, she would not hesitate to fight. “I’d go to the front. I really do love Poland. It’s not something I say lightly. I wouldn’t abandon our nation – I’d defend it,” she said.Outside, on the walls of the college building, streaks gouged into the red brick by shrapnel were visible, left deliberately as a reminder of the devastation wrought on Poland by the second world war. There are few survivors of that war who remain alive today, but generational memories inform fears about the next potential war, particularly among older Poles.As the training day at the military base outside Warsaw came to an end, Pruszko said he had also arranged for employees of his company to receive the same survival course.“Many younger employees have grown up in the EU, in a time of peace, with little sense of the dangers us older generations remember. I hope we never need these skills, but I want them to know what to do if the moment ever comes,” he said.This article was amended on 8 December 2025 to amend two references to new training that said it happened “this month” instead of last month."

The propaganda of these false claims has real implications for our sovereignty, international relations and national security.”Trump’s evidence of South Africa  ‘white genocide’ contains images from Democratic Republic of CongoRead moreTrump and the South African-born billionaire Elon Musk have promoted the false claim that there is a “white genocide” in SouthAfrica, bringing what was previously a niche, far-right conspiracy theory to a far wider audience.Without naming either man, Ramaphosa said in his speech: “It is essential that we counter this narrative and defeat this agenda … This is a campaign that needs to be launched not only in our country, but globally as well, particularly to address the notions that some globally are perpetrating about what is happening in South Africa.”The USboycotted last month’s G20leaders summit in Johannesburg and argued that a consensus could not be reached in its absence. The meeting, led by South Africa, produced a final communique that cited the importance of tackling issues such as gender inequality and climate breakdown, positions that have become anathema to Trump’s agenda.The 2026 summit will take place at the Trump National Doral Miami golf resort in Florida, which is owned by the Trump Organization.The US has invited Poland instead of South Africa to the first meetings of its G20 presidency later this month. The US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, justified the decision,claiming: “The South African government’s appetite for racism and tolerance for violence against its Afrikaner citizens have become embedded as core domestic policies.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe Long WaveFree weekly newsletterNesrine Malik and Jason Okundaye deliver your weekly dose of Black life and culture from around the worldEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The pleasure boat, which dates from the first half of the first century AD, was 35 metres long and constructed to hold a central pavilion with a luxuriously decorated cabin.It was discovered off the submerged island of Antirhodos, which was part of ancient Alexandria’s Portus Magnus (great port).Strabo had visited the Egyptian city around 29-25BC and wrote of such boats: “These vessels are luxuriously fitted out and used by the royal court for excursions; and the crowd of revellers who go down from Alexandria by the canal to the public festivals; for every day and every night is crowded with people on the boats who play the flute and dance without restraint and with extreme licentiousness.”The excavations were conducted by the European Institute for Underwater Archaeology (IEASM) under the direction ofFranck Goddio, a visiting professor in maritime archaeology at the University of Oxford.He told the Guardian: “It’s extremely exciting because it’s the first time ever that such a boat has been discovered in Egypt … Those boats were mentioned by different ancient authors, like Strabo, and they were also represented in some iconography – for example in the Palestrina mosaic, where you see such a boat of a much smaller size with noblemen hunting hippopotamuses. But [an actual boat] has never been discovered before.”A map showing the location of the boat in Alexandria’s Eastern HarbourWhile that mosaic depicts perhaps a 15-metre boat, this one is far larger, judging by its well-preserved timbers, which also span a breadth of about 7 metres. It may have required more than 20 rowers.It had been lying only 7 metres under the water and 1.5 metres under the sediment. Goddio’s initial assumption was that there were two ships on top of one another “because the construction type was so strange”. He added: “The bow is flat … and the stern is round … to be able to navigate in very shallow water.”Goddio’s most ambitious projects have been conducted off the coast of Egypt, in Alexandria’s eastern harbour and in the Bay of Abu Qir. In partnership with Egypt’s Ministry for Antiquities, he has explored a vast area since 1992.In 2000, the ancient city of Thonis-Heracleion and parts of the city of Canopus were discovered in the Bay of Abu Qir – one of the greatest archaeological finds of recent times. Two colossal statues of a Ptolemaic queen and king are among spectacular treasures that have been retrieved so far.In 2019, Goddio and his team found a wreck in the waters aroundThonis-Heracleion, whose unusual details matched the description of another ancient Greek historian, Herodotus.The latest discovery lies less than 50 metres from the site of the Temple of Isis, which Goddio has been excavating. He believes the boat could have sunk during the catastrophic destruction of this temple around AD50.View image in fullscreenThe boat’s well-preserved timbers had been lying only 7 metres underwater and 1.5 metres under the sediment.Photograph: Christoph Gerigk ©Franck Goddio/Hilti FoundationAfter a series of earthquakes and tidal waves, the Portus Magnus and parts of the ancient coastline sank beneath the sea, engulfing palaces and other buildings.Another theory is that the boat could have been a sacred barge attached to the temple. Goddio said: “It could have … [been] part of the naval ceremony of thenavigium Isidis,when a procession celebrating [the goddess] Isis encountered a richly decorated vessel – the Navigium – which embodied the solar barque of Isis, mistress of the sea.”Graffiti in Greek was found on the central carling and is yet to be deciphered.Although research into the wreck is still at an early stage, it promises to reveal new insights into “life, religion, luxury and pleasure on the waterways of early Roman Egypt”, Goddio said.The latest scientific results of excavations on the temple of Isis have recently been published by the Oxford Centre for MaritimeArchaeology.Prof Damian Robinson, the centre’s director, said of the new discovery: “It’s a type of ship that’s never been found before. While we can read about cabin-boats in ancient texts and see them in the artistic record, it’s phenomenal to have the archaeological correlate.”The wreck will remain on the seabed. Goddio said: “We are following the regulation of Unesco, which considers that it is better to [leave] the remains underwater.”Only a tiny percentage of the area has been explored. Excavations are due to resume.Explore more on these topicsEgyptArchaeologyGreeceAfricaHeritagenewsShareReuse this content"

Within 48 hours she wasdeportedto Honduras, a country she left at agesevenwhen her family came to the US.Student describes ‘horror show’ ICE deportation to Honduras at ThanksgivingRead moreHer father and the family’s lawyer told theNew York Timesthat on Sunday immigration agents appeared at their family home in Austin. Her father, Francis López, said immigration agents arrived in three unmarked vehicles. One agent, wearing a green vest marked “ERO” (Enforcement and Removal Operations), reportedly rushed toward him as he washed his car.López said he ran into his back yard and closed a gate, but the agent forced it open and entered the yard. López said he then went inside his house and locked the back door. After about two hours, the agents left, without ever knocking on the door or attempting to communicate with the family, he said.The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Kristin Etter, a lawyer for the family, told the New York Times the agents “did not have any papers or any warrant out”, and said that the family’s home appeared to the be only one where the unmarked vehicles stopped.According to the Times, the family’s petition for asylum was denied about a decade ago. The family say that were never notified of any deportation order. Immigration authorities haveclaimed that in 2015 an immigration judge ordered López Belloza’s removal, and thatshe had“illegally stayed in the country since”. Her lawyer, Todd Pomerleau,has saidhe has has not been able to find any record of such an order, and that her deportation violated an emergency court order issued the day after her detention, barring her removal from the US for at least 72 hours while her case was reviewed.“To be clear, theTrump administrationis targeting a college student’s family because that college student spoke out about the unjust way that she was treated by the federal government” after her detention, the Democratic congressman Greg Casar, who represents the family’s district, told the New York Times.Speaking to theGuardianlast week, López Belloza, who has been staying at her grandparents’ home in northern Honduras, said: “I never thought I would go through this tragedy” and that she has been trying to keep her mind occupied.“I try to be as positive and as strong as I can,” she said. “I want to be able to move forward and maybe continue my studies, whether here [in Honduras] or by finishing my semester at the university. And one day, to be able to see my parents and my family again.“What happened to me isn’t fair,” she said. “Because we went there to study and work hard, to move forward in pursuit of that American dream so many of us had.”Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)Trump administrationHondurasAmericasUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Dark Horse, directed by Cyrus Nowrasteh and written by Mário Frias, who served as secretary of culture under Bolsonaro,started shootingthree months ago in Brazil, where Bolsonaro served as president from 2019 until 2023. He wassentencedto 27 years and three months in prison in September 2025 for leading a criminal conspiracy to stop his leftwing rival,Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, taking power, though his supporters deny the allegations and have compared the prosecution to the “lawfare” allegedly faced by Donald Trump before he was re-elected.The plot, whichinvolved a plan to assassinate Lulaand his running mate, foundered after military chiefs refused to take part. The court found that Bolsonaro and six accomplices tried to “annihilate” Brazilian democracy and return Latin America’s largest democracy to dictatorship.Frias began posting clips from the project showing Caviezel in costume as Bolsonaro on Monday. The film also stars Lynn Collins and Esai Morales, and will conclude production in Mexico and the US in 2026.Bolsonaro’s son Carlosconfirmedthe film’s existence on X, posting a photo of himself with Caviezel in costume as his father. “I know your legacy will continue to be admired by good people and envied by those who seek destruction – yet the message you imprint with every step leaves its mark on the world,” he wrote of Caviezel, ending the post with “God, Jesus and Freedom!”Based on leaks and anunofficial first look, the film appears to focus on Bolsonaro’s 2018 campaign for the presidency, emphasizing his military background. At the time, the disgraced and controversial ex-president drewinternational outragefor saying that Brazil’s Indigenous people “are increasingly becoming human beings just like us” and that he wouldrather his son die in a car accidentthan be gay, among many otherracist, homophobic and misogynistic remarks.Following his breakout in 90s and early aughts films such as The Thin Red Line and Frequency as well as The Passion of the Christ, Caviezel repositioned himself as a representative of Christian Hollywood and the conservative right. To promote his 2023 film Sound of Freedom, which some criticized asQ-Anon adjacentin its paranoia about child sex trafficking, he appeared at various Q-Anon-affiliated events and on a podcast with the Trump ally Steve Bannon. He also appeared on the Maga figure Mike Lindell’s TV channel, among otherrightwing media appearances.The actor is also a public supporter of Donald Trump, endorsing him in 2024 andreferringto him as “The new Moses”.Caviezel was most recently set to star in Resurrection of the Christ, Gibson’s follow-up to his 2004 film. He was recast after the director failed to find an adequate way to digitally de-age him.Bolsonarobeganserving his 27-year sentence, in a parking space-sized room in the capital of Brasília, last month.Explore more on these topicsBiopicsJair BolsonaroBrazilAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

But first he praised God, saying in Spanish, “You saw the injustice and suffering, and in your infinite mercy you helped us.“Thanks to you, Lord, today I’m a free man,” Hernández said while delivering his first remarks since his 1 Decemberpardon. “I never lost the faith.”Hernández then expressed “profound gratitude” to Trump for, as he put it, having the “courage to defend justice and to fulfill his promise that never again would the immense power of the state be used to pursue political opponents”.Within a day of Hernández’s Friday publication of the video, a judgeblockedTrump justice department prosecutors from accessing materials belonging to a key ally of former FBI director James Comey – a political enemy of the US president whom the White House has been trying to criminally prosecute, saying he previously lied to Congress.Hernández subsequently echoed some of Trump’s oft-invoked rhetoric to explain his own legal troubles, saying he was subjected to a corrupt prosecution stemming from a conspiracy engineered by Joe Biden’s presidential administration as well as operators of the so-called deep state. He maintained that the purported conspirators were upset with him for trying to crack down on organized crime inHonduraswhile he was president there.Trump move to pardon Honduras’s ex-president shows counter-drug effort is ‘based on lies and hypocrisy’Read more“They wanted to assassinate my morale, erase my name, and sully my legacy,” said Hernández, Honduras’s president from 2014 to 2022. “Their objective was clear: get me out of the way [and] eliminate the leader who defended law and order.“If I’ve learned something, the truth can be silenced for a time – but it can’t be erased. Today I embark on the task of ensuring that the truth is heard.”Hernández restricted replies to his video on X, allowing only accounts whom he tagged to comment on it. Among the accounts tagged were those of a handful of Trump allies, including the White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, presidential pardon attorney, Ed Martin, conservative political strategist Roger Stone, and former congressman Matt Gaetz.There were no replies visible underneath Hernández’s video. But there had been a community note appended accurately saying in Spanish: “Hernández is not innocent. He was found guilty and sentenced [in connection with] … drug trafficking charges, according to the US justice department.”The community note linked to a justice departmentnews releaseannouncing a 45-year prison sentence that Hernández was given in June 2024.In that case, prosecutors maintained that Hernández accepted $1m from former Mexican cartel kingpin Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán in 2013 while successfully running for his first Honduran presidential term. They also said that Hernández’s government set up Honduras to serve as a pivotal waypoint – or “superhighway” – of cocaine coming from South American nations including Colombia and Venezuela.Hernández was extradited to the US to face the drug and related weapons charges in April 2022, roughly three months after finishing his second presidential term. A jury convicted him on 8 March 2024 after a three-week trial.He was being held at a federal prison in West Virginia when Trump pardoned him, leading to his release from custody by Tuesday.Trump’s pardon caused a political uproar for a couple of reasons. For one, it came as the US president waged a “war on drugs” with airstrikes on accused traffickers in the Pacific as well as the Caribbean – and the positioning of an American naval force off the coast of Venezuela.“If President Trump actually wants to send a strong signal to … heads of states involved in narco-trafficking, pardoning one of the most recent grotesque offenders … is exactly the wrong message,” Senator Chris Coons, a Delaware Democrat, told CNN in what was a typical reaction to the clemency afforded to Hernández.Hernández, furthermore, is just one of more than 100 people accused of drug-related crimes whom Trump has pardoned despite the US president’s fashioning himself as an anti-narcotics crusader, as a Washington Post analysisnotedon Monday.Additionally, Hernández was pardoned amid an unusual level of US interference in the Honduras presidential election. In that race, which as of Monday morning was considered too close to call with votes still being counted, Trump endorsed Hernández’s ally Nasry “Tito” Asfura, saying victory by Asfura was required for US aid to Honduras.Asfura’s main electoral rival, Salvador Nasralla,toldReuters that Trump’s involvement in the election had substantially “hurt” his chances of winning.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpHondurasUS politicsAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

It would end up having global involvement and this would be really unfortunate,” said Amorim, a veteran diplomat and former minister in the first two of Lula’s three terms.“If there was an invasion, a real invasion … I think undoubtedly you would see something similar to Vietnam – on what scale it’s impossible to say,” added Amorim, who thought even some enemies of Venezuela’s authoritarian leader, Nicolás Maduro, would be inclined to join the resistance against such a foreign intervention.1:08'No slave's peace': Maduro assures Venezuela of loyalty after phone call with Trump - video“I know South America … our whole continent exists because of resistance against foreign invaders,” said Amorim, who predicted that any US attack would rekindle anti-American sentiment in Latin America similar to that generated by US meddling during the cold war.The Brazilian diplomat was speaking as Trump’s four-month pressure campaign against Maduro’s regime continued to escalate.Since August,the US has put a $50m bountyon Maduro’s head, launched thebiggest naval deploymentin the Caribbean Sea since the 1962Cuban missile crisis, and carried out a series ofdeadly airstrikeson alleged drug boats that have killed more than 80 people.Most international airlines have halted flights to Venezuela after Trump declared the country’s airspace “closed in its entirety” late last month – a move Amorim called “totally illegal”.According to some reports,Trump gave Maduro a one-week deadline to resignduring a phone call on 21 November – a deadline that has passed.Many observers suspect Trump’s next move could be to order strikes inside Venezuela in what is widely seen as an attempt to topple Maduro by provoking a military rebellion against him. Asked earlier this month if the Venezuelan dictator had offered to relinquish power, Trump replied: “He will.”View image in fullscreenCelso Amorim: ‘The last thing we want is for South America to become a war zone.’Photograph: Felipe Fittipaldi/The GuardianYet Maduro, who was democratically elected in 2013 but iswidely believed to have stolen last year’s election, has shown no sign of buckling.Amorim – whose government has not accepted Maduro’s claim to have won the 2024 poll despite longstanding ties to his political movement – said Brazil opposed forced regime change despite recognising there were “problems” with the vote count.“If every questionable election triggered an invasion, the world would be on fire,” said the diplomat, who emphasised he was speaking in a personal capacity, and not for Lula.“If Maduro reaches the conclusion that leaving [power] is the best thing for him and the best thing for Venezuela, it will be his conclusion … Brazil will never impose this; it will never say that this is a requirement … We are not going to push for Maduro to step down or abdicate,” added Amorim, who admitted Venezuela-Brazil relations were no longer as “warm or intense” as before.There has been growing speculation over Maduro’s likely destination if he relinquishes power and enters exile. Potential sanctuaries are thought to include Cuba, Turkey, Qatar and Russia.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe Long WaveFree weekly newsletterNesrine Malik and Jason Okundaye deliver your weekly dose of Black life and culture from around the worldEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Assessing Trump's actions in Venezuela – video explainer“There are claims that decisive action could create instability or spark migration. But the instability has already happened and the migration has already occurred,” she wrote, noting the 8 million Venezuelans who have fled amid the economic and democratic collapse of the Maduro era.Lula’s foreign policy adviser hoped Trump may be inclined to reach a “negotiated solution” with Maduro and that a peaceful transition could still be achieved, despite the increasingly belligerent mood.Any orderly political transition was likely to take time, Amorim suggested, recalling the “slow, gradual and safe” opening up of Brazil’s 21-year military dictatorship, which began in 1974 and ended with the return of democracy in 1985.Amorim floated the idea of a recall referendum – similar to oneheld in Venezuela in 2004– as a way of defusing its political crisis. “[Then president Hugo] Chávez accepted the idea, somewhat reluctantly, but he accepted it. There was a referendum and he won,” Amorim said, adding: “I don’t know who would win now.”Voting data released by the apparent election winnerand verified by independent expertsshowed Maduro had suffered a stinging defeat to his opponent, Edmundo González. Maduro refused to publish the full voting tallies to support his claim to have won a third six-year term.Explore more on these topicsVenezuelaTrump administrationUS foreign policyDonald TrumpLuiz Inácio Lula da SilvaAmericasBrazilnewsShareReuse this content"

Most of the victims were hit by falling objects, public broadcaster NHK reported, adding that several people were injured in a hotel in Hachinohe and a man in Tohoku was injured when his car fell into a hole.Satoshi Kato, a vice-principal of a high school in Hachinohe, told NHK that he was at home when the quake struck, and that glasses and bowls fell and smashed into shards on the floor.Kato said he drove to the school because it was designated as an evacuation centre, and on the way he encountered traffic jams and car accidents as panicked people tried to flee. Nobody had yet come to the school to take shelter, he said.About 480 residents were taking shelter at the Hachinohe airbase, and 18 defence helicopters were mobilised for a damage assessment, said the defense minister, Shinjirō Koizumi.About 200 passengers were stranded for the night at New Chitose airport in Hokkaido, NHK reported.The epicentre of the quake was 50 miles (80km) off the coast of Aomori prefecture, the agency added.On Japan’s one-to-seven scale of seismic intensity, the tremor registered as an “upper six” in Aomori prefecture – a quake strong enough to make it impossible to keep standing or move without crawling. In such tremors, most heavy furniture can collapse and wall tiles and windowpanes are damaged in many buildings.East Japan Railway suspended some services in the area, which was also hit by the massive 9.0-magnitude quake in March 2011.No irregularities were reported at nuclear power plants in the region run by Tohoku Electric Power and Hokkaido Electric Power, the utility companies said. Tohoku Electric did say, however, that thousands were without power.Japan is one of the world’s most earthquake-prone countries, with a tremor occurring at least every five minutes. Located in the “ring of fire” arc of volcanoes and oceanic trenches partly encircling the Pacific Basin, Japan accounts for about 20% of the world’s earthquakes of magnitude 6.0 or greater.Explore more on these topicsJapanEarthquakesTsunamisAsia PacificNatural disastersExtreme weathernewsShareReuse this content"

It said Thai forces had launched attacks on its troops on Monday and Cambodia had not retaliated, despite “provocative actions for many days”.View image in fullscreenA family fleeing their home after clashes on the Cambodia-Thailand border in Preah Vihear province.Photograph: Agence Kampuchea Presse (akp)/AFP/Getty ImagesFour Cambodian civilians were killed in Oddar Meanchey and Preah Vihear provinces, according to Cambodia’s information minister, Neth Pheaktra.Six weeks ago,Trump oversaw the signing of a ceasefire agreementhe brokered to end a five-day war that erupted in July. At least 48 people were killed in the conflict and 300,000 forced to flee their homes.Tensions have remained high despite the ceasefire agreement, with both sides accusing each other other of violations, and Thailand announcing in November that it wassuspending the deal.Gen Chaiyapruek Duangprapat, the Thai army’s chief of staff, said it was seeking to cripple Cambodia’s military capability, with the aim of neutralising it as a threat in the long term.Cambodia’s former prime minister Hun Sen, who remains hugely influential and is the father of the current leader, Hun Manet, urged his country’s forces to exercise restraint althoughThailandwas trying to “pull us into retaliation”.View image in fullscreenAn injured Thai soldier is taken away for treatment after clashes along the border.Photograph: Royal Thai Army/AFP/Getty Images“The red line for responding has already been set. I urge commanders at all levels to educate all officers and soldiers accordingly,” Hun Sen said in a Facebook post.Thailand’s prime minister, Anutin Charnvirakul, said in a televised address the country did not want violence and denied initiating conflict. “However, Thailand will not tolerate violations of its sovereignty and will proceed rationally and with due regard for the principles of peace, security and humanity,” he said.More than 385,000 civilians have been ordered to evacuate from border areas across four provinces, according to Thai authorities, who said about 50,000 people had left for shelters.mapPeople also fled villages on the Cambodian side of the border, according to the country’s ministry of information, which said 1,157 families had been evacuated to safe areas.The Malaysian prime minister, Anwar Ibrahim, who helped broker the original ceasefire, urged Thailand and Cambodia to avoid escalation, warning that the fighting risked “unravelling the careful work that has gone into stabilising relations between the two neighbours”.“We urge both sides to exercise maximum restraint, maintain open channels of communication and make full use of the mechanisms in place,” Anwar, the chair of the regional bloc Asean, said in a post online.Tensions increased in May, when troops exchanged fire briefly at a contested area, killing a Cambodian soldier. This led to aseries of tit-for-tat actionsby both governments and escalated into conflict in July. A ceasefire was agreed after an intervention by Trump, who warned trade talks would be suspended until there was a peace deal, as well as efforts by Malaysia and China.View image in fullscreenPeople rest at a shelter after the latest military clashes between Thailand and Cambodia.Photograph: Prajoub Sukprom/ReutersHowever, the arrangement has remained fragile, and last monthThailand said it was suspending the ceasefire deal,accusing Cambodia of laying fresh landmines along the border, including one it said had wounded a Thai soldier, who lost a foot in the explosion.A Cambodian civilian was later killed, and three wounded, according to the Cambodian prime minister, after both sides accused the other of opening fire.At the time, Trump, who has used trade negotiations to put pressure on both sides,played down the incidents, saying he had “stopped a war” through the use of tariffs, adding: “I think they’re gonna be fine.”Chart of clashes along the Thailand-Cambodia borderThe dispute between Thailand and Cambodia dates back more than a century, to when France, which occupied Cambodia until 1953, first mapped the land border.Conflict over the border, which stretches across more than 508 miles (817km), has erupted repeatedly over the years, fanned by nationalist sentiment.Asked about Trump’s intervention and Anwar’s call for restraint, the Thai prime minister, Anutin Charnvirakul, told reporters that no one should tell his country to “exercise restraint or to stop – we’re long past that point”.“If you want things to stop, tell the aggressor to stop,” he added.Explore more on these topicsThailandCambodiaAsia PacificTrump administrationUS foreign policyUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

But fewer people overall voted this year: 1.3 million compared to 1.4 million in 2021. Hong Kong’s population is about 7.5 million.Only candidates vetted as “patriots” by a government committee were allowed to stand for election in the city’s 90-seat legislature. Only 20 of those seats are directly elected.‘Don’t say we didn’t warn you’: Hong Kong foreign media told not to cause trouble after fireRead moreThe government mounted a huge campaign to encourage people to vote, extending the opening hours of polling stations by two hours compared with 2021 and plastering the city with posters urging people to turn out.Voters also received a “thank you card” that could be redeemed in local businesses for rewards and authorities released an election anthem called “Let’s Vote, Together We Create the Future”, inspired by Cantopop star Aaron Kwok’s 2001 hit song Strong.After anelectoral overhaul in 2021, only pro-Beijing “patriots” have been allowed to run for government in Hong Kong, and the proportion of seats that are elected – rather than appointed – has been reduced. It means that boycotting the vote is one of the only ways that Hongkongers can safely express their dissatisfaction.Inciting others to boycott the vote was criminalised in 2021. On Sunday, Hong Kong’s Independent Commission Against Corruption (Icac) said that four men, aged between 31 and 44, had been arrested for allegedly inciting others not to vote, or to cast invalid votes, in social media comments. The Icac said all up it had arrested 11 people for allegedly contravening laws in relation to the offence during the current election, and three had so far been prosecuted.View image in fullscreenFlowers laid for the victims of a deadly fire at the Wang Fuk Court residential estate in Hong Kong.Photograph: Peter Parks/AFP/Getty ImagesThe election took place in the shadow of Hong Kong’s worst tragedy in decades, theTai Po firethat killed at least 159 people in a blaze that spread across seven apartment blocks at a residential compound in northern Hong Kong.As more revelations come to light about alleged building safety violations and questions over lax or negligent enforcement, residents in Hong Kong have demanded transparency from the government about the investigation, and any official culpability.But mourning activities and calls for accountability over the fire have sparked suspicion among authorities in Hong Kong. Instead they have launched a sweeping crackdown in the biggest test of Beijing’s national security regime in the city since thepro-democracy protests in 2019 and 2020.At least three people are thought to have been arrested for alleged national security offences:Miles Kwan, a Hong Kong student who started an online petition calling for government accountability, former district councillor Kenneth Cheung and Wong On-yin, a 71-year-old political commentator.On Saturday the government cleared an impromptu memorial site near the burned buildings, where people had been laying flowers in tribute for days. The pre-announced clearing began late at night.“I wish it could go for longer as I believe there are still people who did not have enough time or the chance to express their feelings,” one resident told Reuters.Earlier that day, the chief superintendent of the police’s national security department, Steve Li, told media he had seen “familiar” scenes at Tai Po which reminded him of the 2019 protests, claiming the presence of pamphlets and signs “basically unrelated to the disaster”, reported the Hong Kong Free Press.“I’ve been there to observe, and I think the situation was becoming more and more like that of ‘black-clad violence’,” Li said.Authorities also targeted foreign press over their reporting of the fire, with representatives of outlets including the New York Timescalled in by authorities on Saturday.Some Hongkongers who had been posting about the fires online, or contributing to civilian digital information resources, have stopped, citing “force majeure” or concerns about their activity being “misconstrued” by authorities. Last week at the Hong Kong Baptist University a student-made “democracy wall” calling for justice for victims was covered up, and the next day the student union was shut down.Explore more on these topicsHong KongHong Kong apartment firesAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

Less than 24 hours later, two houses on his street would be lost and the surrounding forest reduced to blackened skeletal remains.Morgan’s township of Bulahdelah, about 200km north of Sydney, was where aveteran firefighter diedon Sunday evening when he was struck by a falling tree, marking what the NSW premier called a “foreboding start” to thebushfire season.Four properties were lost in the broader Bulahdelah area, including two on Emu Creek Road, where Morgan lives, one on the Pacific Highway and one south of the township.View image in fullscreenSmoke from a bushfire disrupts traffic on the Pacific Highway near the town of Nerong south of Bulahdelah.Photograph: Blake Sharp-Wiggins/The GuardianBulahdelah is a popular stopover on the Pacific Highway for holidaymakers on their way up the mid-north coast to beach areas such as Seal Rocks, Forster and Port Macquarie.On Monday afternoon, the highway south of town was blanketed in thick, orange smoke. Water-bombing helicopters hovered overhead, assisting firefighters on the ground who were attempting to quash a blaze that had burnt 4,000 hectares since Friday.Passing trucks slowed to observe traffic cones and reduce-speed signs, the blackened gum trees and charred grass on each side of the highway evidence of how far the fire had burnt through the adjacent Myall Lakes national park. It remained at a watch and act level on Monday evening, with the alert level reducing further as conditions eased by midnight.View image in fullscreenWater-bombing helicopters over Bulahdelah.Photograph: Blake Sharp-Wiggins/The GuardianIn Bulahdelah, it would have seemed like another ordinary day if not for the helicopters circling overhead and the smell of smoke lingering in the air.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailA refuelling station for aircraft was set up at the town’s showground, transforming it into a hub for about 300 firefighters and volunteers who travelled from across the state to help.On Monday afternoon, cartons of water were being unloaded from trucks and lollies were being packaged into zip-lock bags. One firefighter estimated that they needed a bottle of water every 20 minutes when they were on the frontline.mapBillows of smoke were continuing to emit from spots of embers on Emu Creek Road, a winding rural street that hugs a creek bed south of the township where two houses were lost.On a fence post outside a burnt property, a charred teddy bear remained pinned to the log, complete with a Christmas hat.Down the road, Morgan sat on his porch with his two dogs, a little patch of grass surrounding his house the only remaining sign of how the landscape used to look. Miraculously, his property was saved, despite his neighbour’s burning to the ground.View image in fullscreenBurnt Christmas decorations hang from a telegraph pole south of Bulahdelah.Photograph: Blake Sharp-Wiggins/The GuardianHe recalled receiving a call from a friend at lunchtime on Saturday, telling him “you’ve got about half an hour and then a fire’s going to hit”. The estimate was spot on.“We sprayed the house and shed down, sprayed the fence line,” he said, and then his reaction turned to “panic”. “I thought, ‘What the hell have I got myself into’,” he said. “But I wasn’t leaving.”Fortunately, firefighters surrounded the house and managed to save it. The bushfire passed over in about half an hour, sounding like “a roaring flame”.View image in fullscreenGarry Morgan with a photograph of him during the fire.Photograph: Blake Sharp-Wiggins/The Guardian“No words can express it,” he said. “The dogs didn’t leave my side, it was frightening.”Morgan, who has lived in the same house for about 30 years, has never seen the land so dry.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But you’ve got to take the good with the bad.”On the same street, Jeff Curley was looking after his friend’s property which had also largely survived Saturday’s blaze, other than a broken headlight on a car and a barrel of firewood stored for winter that had burnt to ash.“I’ve been here many, many times,” he said. “A few years ago a fire almost approached a nearby ridge and that was pretty scary then, but the wind changed.“It’s just so much drier this time. It came from everywhere, and the firies pretty much saved it [the property].”This experience wasn’t new for Curley, who nearly lost his home in Wattle Grove when fires came through in 2019.View image in fullscreenJeff Curley at his friend’s home south of Bulahdelah.Photograph: Blake Sharp-Wiggins/The Guardian“You see people on the news say, ‘I can’t believe how fast it came’,” he said. “You think it’s over there, and all of a sudden it’s on top of you. I know what it’s like. I told my friend to just get out of there, and he did.”Kirsty Channon, public information officer for the NSW Rural Fire Service, said crews from multiple agencies had come from “right up and down the coast” to assist in the containment effort and had done an “amazing job” protecting houses from being destroyed.She said all agencies had “pulled together” after the death of one of their own.“The firefighting community is one big family,” she said. “But we’re definitely not out of the woods yet.“We’ve seen the Pacific Highway open and close a few times, the fire jump backwards and forwards. It’s still not contained, it will continue to grow.”View image in fullscreenA bushfire burns south of Bulahdelah.Photograph: Blake Sharp-Wiggins/The GuardianChannon said efforts in the coming hours and days would focus on the tiny township of Nerong, which was expected to be hit by the Pacific Highway blaze on Monday evening.

This follows a dry spring for large parts of south-eastern Australia thanks to theinfluence of a rare warming phenomenon– called sudden stratospheric warming – over Antarctica.View image in fullscreenExperts say people should prepare with bushfire survival and evacuation plans now.Photograph: Dan Himbrechts/AAPDavid Bowman, a professor of pyrogeography and fire science at the University of Tasmania, said “the No 1 message is: expect the unexpected”.In a world of increasing climate instability, he said people should “stop assuming a seasonal forecast or the authorities can have some crystal ball to tell you what February is going to be like”.Instead, he said the “smartest thing” people could do was prepare: have a bushfire survival plan and build situational awareness, at home or when travelling.The seasonal outlookThis year, long-term rainfall deficiencies in parts of Victoria and increased fuel loads in parts of NSW and Western Australia are creating increased fire risk in southern Victoria, central western NSW and the Yalgoo and Geraldton Sandplains regions of WA, according to the seasonal fire outlook from the national council for fire and emergency services in Australia and New Zealand.Soil moisture deficits are also driving increased bushfire risk in northern parts of the Swan coastal plain, Jarrah forest, Esperance plains and Mallee regions of WA.Andrew Gissing, the chief executive of National Hazards Research Australia, said the outlook was designed to show areas considered at increased risk. He said this did not mean areas outside the red zones were not at risk.View image in fullscreenBen Millington, the deputy commissioner of the NSW RFS, says fuel loads over the past few years had grown before a rapid drying across much of the state.Photograph: WM Through The Lens Photography“Moving into summer is certainly a call for all Australians living in bushfire-prone areas in southern Australia to be prepared,” he said.Gissing said while fire seasons in southern Australia had been more “subdued” after rain and flooding in recent years, the indicators were starting to shift.“Particularly with how dry the soils are starting to get. We’re starting to see landscapes dry out, so we’ll see drier fuels ready to burn.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toClear Air AustraliaFree newsletterAdam Morton brings you incisive analysis about the politics and impact of the climate crisisEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That’s extreme dryness.”Neither the NSW Central Coast nor the areas of Tasmania’s east coast that have burned over the past week were identified as having higher risk in the seasonal outlook, which Mullins said demonstrated that risk could occur anywhere with the right conditions.“I’d say to people, after five wet years, put your fire hat back on,” he said.“If you live in a bushfire-prone area, now is the time to really think about what you’re going to do to protect your family and home.”Explore more on these topicsBushfiresAustralia weathernewsShareReuse this content"

The fourth victim, a woman, died on Monday, a day after being revived at the scene and airlifted to a hospital.Two of the victims were Romanian and two were Slovaks, their respective governments said. No further information about the identities of the victims was provided.Three dead and 15 hurt after rough seas pull people into the ocean in TenerifeRead moreThe pool at Isla Cangrejo, on Tenerife’s Los Gigantes coast, is very popular with foreign tourists, according to local media. Bordered by volcanic rock on one side and walled off from the sea on the other, the pool sits at nearly sea level and can be very dangerous during rough seas when large waves can easily overcome the cement barrier.Local media reported that a weather advisory for rough seas was in effect at the time when the swimmers were swept out to sea. One media outlet reported that the pool had been closed to swimmers since 3 December.Residents said swimmers had ignored signs and fencing put up to prevent anyone from going into the pool because of the weather conditions. They said it’s very difficult for anyone dragged out to sea to get a foothold on slippery rocks just below the pool.“People ... don’t know how the sea is here, and the danger of the pool, because there are rocks below on which people fall and can’t get back up. It’s very dangerous,” said one resident who didn’t give his name.Emilio Navarro, the mayor of Santiago Del Tiede, offered his condolences to the families of the dead and said rescue crews continued on Monday to search for the missing swimmer.He said authorities take steps to warn bathers of the dangers and to dissuade them from using the pool during rough seas. “We ... ask people to pay attention to the signage put up by the authorities,” he said. “It’s to take care of and protect everyone.”In November,strong waves killed three peopleand injured 15 in Tenerife by pulling them into the Atlantic Ocean during a tidal surge.Explore more on these topicsSpainEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Cooper spent Monday in Washington, where she met the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio.In remarks apparently aimed in Moscow’s direction, Cooper will say: “A hundred years ago, such malign actors or state-sponsored disrupters may have relied on expertly forged documents or carefully planted stories to manipulate public opinion, but today’s technology is lowering the barrier to entry – meaning more actors, with less skill, can work on behalf of regimes abroad.“They can interfere with free and fair elections, so that western interests are weakened and lose allies on the global stage. By flooding social media with generative AI and manipulated videos, they can gradually undermine support for our major allies like Ukraine with lies – hitting our collective resolve to support Ukraine’s resistance to Russia’s illegal invasion.”She will say disinformation is being used not only to undermine Ukraine directly but also to exacerbate social divisions on issues such as gender and migration.“This isn’t about legitimate debate on contentious issues. Plenty of people in the UK have strong views on migration, gender and climate. But they are our debates to have – not those for foreign states to use as their playground, trying to sow division to advance their own interests.”Officials point to disinformation campaigns around the world, which they say were carried out by hostile states.They include the creation of fake websitesduring the Moldovan electionsin September that looked as if they belonged to the PAS party and contained fabricated policies such as raising the retirement age and increasing the length of military service.Explore more on these topicsForeign policyForeign, Commonwealth and Development OfficeYvette CooperUkraineRussiaArtificial intelligence (AI)EuropenewsShareReuse this content"

During the meeting, leaders “underscored the need for a just and lasting peace in Ukraine” including “robust security guarantees” against further Russian aggression, Downing Street said.The leaders agreed that “now is a critical moment” for Ukraine and vowed to ramp up support for Kyiv and increase economic pressure on Moscow “to bring an end to this barbaric war”.The European show of support came after sharp criticism from President Trump, who said he was “a little disappointed” in Zelenskyy, claiming he had not read the US proposal for a peace deal. He insisted without evidence that “his [Ukrainian] people love it” and that Russia’s president,Vladimir Putin, was “fine with it”.The discussions follow US efforts to push through a peace deal that has triggered widespread concerns because it is seen by many critics as favouring positions held byRussia.Downing Street is hoping for a breakthrough on a deal to seize billions in Russian state assets held by European banks and funnel it to Ukraine.No 10 said the talks on Monday had yielded “positive progress” in the lengthy effort to use “immobilised Russian sovereign assets to support Ukraine’s reconstruction”. More than £180bn of Russian assets has been frozen in European banks and financial institutions since Putin launched his full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.EU leaders will meet on 18 and 19 December in an attempt to sign off on a long-awaited European Commission proposal to funnel £78bn of the frozen assets into a “reparations loan” that would go to Kyiv next year.The unprecedented proposal hinges on the idea that Moscow would eventually pay Kyiv reparations for the colossal damage caused by the fighting. Kyiv would use the reparations from Moscow to repay the loan to the EU, ensuring that the financial institutions holding the assets would get the money back.Though a majority of EU countries support the plan, it has met strong resistance from Belgium. About £160bn of Russian assets are immobilised at Euroclear, a central securities depository in Brussels, and the Belgian government is concerned that it will bear liability for any seizure and face retaliation from Moscow.The UK is prepared to hand over £8bn of assets frozen in Britain to support Ukraine but wants to do so in conjunction with other European countries.Starmer is set to discuss the issue on Friday with his Belgian counterpart Bart De Wever, who has come under pressure from other EU leaders. A spokesperson for the Belgian prime minister said he would be meeting Starmer in Downing Street to discuss “priorities like migration, supporting Ukraine, European security and mutual economic growth”.The meeting will come a week after Merz flew to Brussels in an effort to persuade De Wever to drop his opposition to the reparations loan plan.British, French, German and Ukrainian national security advisers have been instructed to continue discussions on the US-proposed peace plan this week.Zelenskyy, who has warned that his country “can’t manage” without European and American support, said the talks had been productive and had made a “small progress towards peace”. He said that Ukraine-Europe plans for a peace deal should be ready by tomorrow to share with the US.US officials claim they are in the final stage of reaching an agreement but there is little sign that either Ukraine or Russia is willing to sign the existing framework deal drawn up by Trump’s negotiating team.Among the sticking points is a Russian demand that Ukraine give up large swathes of territory in exchange for peace but Zelenskyy said last night that Kyiv had no legal or moral right to do this.“Russia is insisting that we give up territories, but we don’t want to cede anything,” Zelenskyy said at a press conference.“There are difficult problems concerning the territories and so far there has been no compromise.”The foreign secretary, Yvette Cooper, was due to meet her US counterpart, Marco Rubio, for further discussions on Monday, with the Foreign Office saying the two sides would “reaffirm their commitment to reaching a peace deal in Ukraine”.The talks follow the publication of aUS national security strategy, which spells out the Trump administration’s core foreign policy interests.The document released on Friday by the White House said the US wanted to improve its relationship with Russia after years of Moscow being treated as a global pariah and that ending the war was a core US interest to “re-establish strategic stability with Russia”.Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin’s spokesperson, said the document was largely in line with Moscow’s vision. The strategy paper also said Nato must not be “a perpetually expanding alliance” and suggested European states faced the “prospect of civilisational erasure” because of migration.Explore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaVolodymyr ZelenskyyVladimir PutinFriedrich MerzEmmanuel MacronDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

        "Content": "7h ago14.08 ESTClosing SummaryAnd that brings our coverage of Ukraine peace talks between Keir Starmer,Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Emmanuel Macron and Friedrich Merz to a close.Here’s a breakdown of the most important developments from the day:After the meeting with the Ukrainian president at Downing Street this afternoon, Keir Starmer said he and European leaders have agreed on the need for Europe to “stand with Ukraine” and “ramp up” economic pressure on Vladimir Putin.They noted progress had been made by the US-led peace talks and have instructed their national security advisers to continue discussions over the coming days. (18:39)Volodymyr Zelenskyy described today’s talks as “productive”, and said they had made a “small progress towards peace”. He said that a 20-point proposal from Ukraine and Europe for a peace deal would be ready by tomorrow evening to share with the US.(18:13)Before the private talks with Zelenskyy, Macron and Starmer, German chancellor Friedrich Merz said he was “sceptical” about some of the US proposals for a peace dealand added that “these could be decisive” days “for all of us” on Ukraine. (13:35)The issue of territory is still the “most problematic” in talks on ending the war, an official familiar with the negotiations said.“Putin does not want to enter into an agreement without territory. So they are looking for any options to ensure that Ukraine cedes territory,” the official said. (10:28)European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen has insisted that the bloc “has the means and the will to increase pressure on Russia to come to the negotiations table.”She particularly defended the EU’s proposal for a reparations loan – backed by frozen Russian assets – a plan that however continues to be opposed by Belgium. (17:08)The leaders of seven EU countries have said a reparations loan for Ukraine based on Russian frozen assets is the most “politically realistic solution” to meet Kyiv’s urgent funding needs.The declaration of support was made in a letter to the European Council president, António Costa, and commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, ahead of an EU summit next week, when Ukraine’s financing needs will be top of the agenda.

He found it “particularly shocking” that Le Pen had been barred from running for office, including the 2027 presidency, after she was found guilty ofembezzlement of European parliament funds on a vast scaleearlier this year.Le Pen will face an appeal trial next month, which will determine whether or not she can run for president in 2027 or whether her party president, Jordan Bardella, will replace her.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He received a presidential pardon from Trump in 2020.Reuters reported that, although Kushner was granted permission to see Sarkozy behind bars, the two men did not meet until after his release.A state department spokesperson told Reuters that Kushner had “wanted to visit former president Sarkozy out of personal compassion and respect to Sarkozy as a former French head of state and someone who has been a good friend to the United States”.Explore more on these topicsFranceNicolas SarkozyMarine Le PenNational RallyEmmanuel MacronEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

These give Israel control of more than half ofGaza, including most agricultural land and the border crossing with Egypt.“The ‘yellow line’ is a new border line, serving as a forward defensive line for our communities and a line of operational activity,” Zamir said during a visit to meet Israeli reservists in northern Gaza, where he also visited the ruins of the Palestinian towns of Beit Hanoun and Jabaliya.“We have operational control over extensive parts of the Gaza Strip and we will remain on those defence lines,” Zamir said, according to an English-language transcript of his remarks provided by a military spokesperson.Palestinians were forced out of this eastern portion of Gaza by Israeli attacks and evacuation orders. Almost all the surviving population, over 2 million people, are now crowded into a narrow zone of coastal sand dunes that is smaller than Washington DC.Map of Gaza showing yellow lineZamir’s commitment to keep troops in Gaza appears to contradict the ceasefire agreement signed in October, which specifies that “Israel will not occupy or annex Gaza”.Trump’s20-point plancommits the Israeli military to “progressively hand over” Palestinian territory to an international security force until they have “withdrawn completely from Gaza”, barring a small security perimeter by the border.The Israeli government declined to comment on whether Zamir’s statement reflected official policy. An official said Israeli forces were “deployed in Gaza in accordance with the ceasefire outline” and accused Hamas of violating the ceasefire.The ceasefire agreement links the departure of Israeli forces to the demilitarisation of Hamas, without laying out a mechanism or a timeframe for that to happen.A UN resolution passed last month authorised the creation of an international security force but no countries have committed troops to stand it up. Some have expressed interest in joining a peacekeeping force, but none want to risk their soldiers being ordered to fight Hamas, despite pressure from the Trump administration.The Israeli army has built new concrete outposts along the “yellow line” to fortify its positions and declared it a lethal boundary, even though it is not always clearly marked and a ceasefire is in place. Soldiers have repeatedly killed Palestinians they accuse of crossing it, includingyoung children.Concrete bollards laid out to mark some stretches of the line have also been used to expand Israel’s military occupation of Gaza. Satellite images show that some markers have been placedhundreds of metres beyond the boundary agreedon ceasefire maps.The US military has also beenplanning for the long-term partition of Gazaalong the “yellow line”, and one US official has desccribed reunification as “aspirational”.Documents seen by the Guardian envisage the territory split into a “green zone” under Israeli and international military control, where reconstruction would start, and a “red zone” to be left indefinitely in ruins.Explore more on these topicsGazaIsraelPalestineMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

These include a visit to the UN general assembly, the climate change conference in Brazil, and numerous Arab summits.In the latest sign of the goodwill directed towards Syria’s rebirth, envoys from all 15 members of the UN security council were in Damascus last week tomark the anniversary of the fall of Bashar al-Assad. The display of unity was a remarkable moment: since 2011 no issue has divided the security council more bitterly than Syria.The visit was also an acknowledgment of the role Syria and its diaspora can play in bringing stability to the Middle East.But ultimately the test will be whether Sharaa is able to translate this curiosity and goodwill into something tangible for the Syrian people in terms of lifted sanctions, internal stability and freedom from external meddling, whether by Israel, Iran or Sharaa’s potential ideological partnerTurkey.On the investment front, overseas pledges are rolling in. Saudi Arabia has promised investments worth more than $6bn (£4.5bn). Qatar is helping to revive the oil and gas industry and the final set of US sanctions is likely to be lifted in a vote before Christmas. But such is the chaos, Syria’s central bank admits it does not know the country’s true GDP.The influx of Gulf investment is dependent on Sharaa continuing on a path of internal reconciliation and trust-building, far removed from the extremist threat. At the same time he has to show his still-reeling country is not being used as a base from which either Islamists in the south can threatenIsraelor from which Kurds in the north will threaten Turkey.In this task he has gained the unlikely support of Donald Trump, who has promised to visit Damascus soon. Sharaa has already met Trump three times, including a critical meeting in November in the White House, becoming the first Syrian president to visit the Oval Office since 1948.View image in fullscreenDonald Trump shaking hands with Sharaa at the White House in Washington on 10 November.Photograph: HOGP/AP“He comes from a very tough place, and he’s a tough guy. I like him,” Trump gushed when they met.With his usual stream of consciousness, Trump continued: “We’ll do everything we can to make Syria successful, because that’s part of the Middle East. We have peace now in the Middle East – the first time that anyone can remember that ever happening.”Trump also obligingly brushed aside Sharaa’s controversial history. “We’ve all had rough pasts,” he said, as if property contract disputes in New York were on a par with Sharaa’s military turf war in Raqqa with the leader of Islamic State (Isis), Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, in which Sharaa lost 1,200 fighters.Perhaps the most striking of Sharaa’s many meetings was on stage in New York in September when he was interviewed by Gen David Petraeus, the former CIA director and retired army generalwho commanded US forces in Iraq while Sharaa was imprisoned there with other members of al-Qaida. Petraeus showed concern for the Syrian leader’s personal wellbeing, asking whether he was getting enough sleep. He added his former prisoner had “many fans” and that he was one of them. Sharaa said with a smile when asked about their shared past: “At a time, we were in combat and now we move to discourse.”“We cannot judge the past based on the rules of today and cannot judge today based on the rules of the past,” the Syrian president said.View image in fullscreenDavid Petraeus, a former director of the CIA and ex-US military general, with Sharaa during the Concordia Annual Summit in New York, in September.Photograph: HOGP/APThat willingness to reject the rules of the past is reflected in the remarkable joint intelligence operations Syria’s interior ministry conducted alongside the US last month, locating 15 Isis weapons caches in southern Syria.The concern is that external pressures are hampering Sharaa in his daunting task of keeping the country unified. In the south, Israel remains convinced Islamists are preparing terrorist attacks, while in the north, Turkey is impatient to see the strong Kurdish Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) either disarmed or fully integrated into the Syrian army.In both instances the White House is urging the external actors to be patient. In the case of Israel the fear in Damascus is it is intent on weakening Syria to the point it fragments, with a Druze-dominated rump state in the south.In total Syria has been hit by nearly 1,000 Israeli airstrikes, including on the capital, and faced more than 600 ground incursions.View image in fullscreenSmoke billows after Israeli strikes near the Syrian army and defence ministry headquarters in Damascus.Photograph: AFP/Getty ImagesSyria has been in no military position to do anything other than protest. There are now signs that Trump is losing patience with what he regards as a counterproductive land grab that prevents Syria from restoring its sovereignty.The US president warned Israel not to overstep the mark, saying on Truth Social: “It is very important that Israel maintain a strong and true dialogue with Syria, and that nothing takes place that will interfere with Syria’s evolution into a prosperous state.”Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, sensing Trump’s displeasure, said a security agreement with Syria was possible so long as Sharaa established a demilitarised buffer zone stretching from Damascus to Mount Hermon. But Trump may argue that by weakening Sharaa, Israel is only fuelling the instability in which extremism thrives.In Syria’s north, Sharaa’s efforts to integrate the Syrian Kurd fighters mainly in the SDF into a Syrian national army, once due to be completed by December, have stalled. For years Turkish policy has been driven by animosity toward the mainly Kurdish SDF, which it equates with the Kurdistan Workers’ party (PKK), a group that it sees as a terrorist group operating inside Turkey.The SDF claims to have about 70,000 men and women in its ranks and has received years of US training as part of the American-led coalition’s ongoing efforts to stamp out all remnants of Isis. It controls 25% of Syria’s territory. The SDF fears that disarmament could leave its fighters vulnerable to attacks from Islamist groups aligned with Sharaa.The SDF agreed in March to integrate with the Syrian military but only so long as its forces enjoyed a degree of autonomy.But since then Turkey has intensified talks about a possible peace deal with the PKK’s leader, Abdullah Öcalan, imprisoned on İmralı IslandIn a recent interview with Al-Monitor, the Syrian Kurdish leader Aldar Khalil argued the solution to the issue of SDF integration lay inside Turkey. Khalil said: “With every step that Turkey takes to resolve the Kurdish issue inside Turkey, our potential to become allies can only grow. Moreover, if there is a solution to the Kurdish problem in Turkey, then Turkey’s efforts to prevent Sharaa from granting the Kurds their rights will cease as well. I believe what happens in Turkey will determine what happens here.”What is clear is that after being a playground for external actors ranging from Russia and the US to Iran and Turkey, Syria still faces a perilous path back to sovereignty.Explore more on these topicsSyriaFall of Assad: one year onMiddle East and north AfricaUS foreign policyIsraelTurkeyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

His right eye, lost in an attack on a rebel observation post he was manning in 2012, is covered by yellow medical tape. Propped against the wall is a cane he uses to walk, after a rocket attack in 2014 left him with a limp.For 14 years, Ali dreamed of freedom and of justice. A year after the ousting ofBashar al-Assad, he has his freedom but not his justice. The man he was dreaming of holding accountable – a member of his extended family who was a part of an Assad militia – had already fled the country by the time Ali returned to his home in Damascus.View image in fullscreenPeople carry Mazen Hamada to be buried after his body was found in 2024 in the Sednaya prison in Damascus after the fall of the Assad regime.Photograph: David LombeidaA year ago on Monday, the 53-year-long rule of the Assad family was ended after a stunning 11-day rebel offensive that took Syria and the world by surprise.The toppling of Assad ended a ruinous 14-year-long civil war that had left 620,000 people dead and banished the fearsome security apparatus that gave the country its reputation as the “kingdom of silence”.Assad and his family were granted asylum in Moscow in December 2024 and recent reports suggest they are living in quiet exile under Russian protection.Syrians from across the country gathered and raised their voices to celebrate the end of the regime, raising the revolutionary three-starred-Syrian flag and chanting for freedom. In a speech at the Umayyad mosque in Damascus, the man who was to become the country’s president, Ahmad al-Sharaa, promised to rebuild a “strong and just Syria” for all of its components, promising reconstruction for the ruined country.Syrians filled the capital’s squares in their tens of thousands on Monday to celebrate the anniversary, but lurking behind the celebrations are painful questions about the country’s future.View image in fullscreenA man holds up a baby as people gather to celebrate the first anniversary of Bashar al-Assad’s fall, at Umayyad Square in Damascus.Photograph: Yamam Al Shaar/Reuters“We know who committed massacres against us – they’re still present in our homes. But to file a complaint you need evidence, and who has that?” says Ali, who works in digital media.Lack of evidence did not spare Riham Hamouyeh. Late last October, attackers vaulted the garden wall of her home in Homs, central Syria, and hurled a grenade inside, killing her in front of her two young children. The 32-year-old Alawite schoolteacher had faced frequent harassment since her husband, a former mechanic in Assad’s army, was arrested two months earlier.View image in fullscreenA member of the Syrian security forces stands guard as people shop at a market in central Homs before Eid al-Adha in June.Photograph: Omar Haj Kadour/AFP/Getty Images“None of us are comfortable, we’re all exhausted. My wife has collapsed, she won’t open the door any more,” said Hamouyeh’s father-in-law, Mohammed Issa Hameidoosh, 63, as he swept broken glass from her home, chunks of the floor still missing where the grenade exploded.Hamouyeh’s death was one in a series of targeted killings of former regime officers and members of the Alawite sect, to which Assad belonged. The killings occur on a near-daily basis in the multi-sectarian city of Homs, despite a general amnesty issued by the new authorities for former regime figures not accused of having blood on their hands.Rubble in the Karm al-Zaytun neighbourhood in HomsThe Karm al-Zaytun neighbourhood in Homs, central Syria, was the scene of several massacres during the civil war. The neighbourhood’s original inhabitants were largely displaced by the fighting and returned to find their homes in ruins.A year after the fall of Assad, Syria’s new rulers have successfully reintegrated the country into the global community, far exceeding the expectations of even the country’s most enthusiastic advocates.But inside Syria, tensions continue to simmer. With a transitional justice process moving too slowly for its victims, old grievances are surfacing in new cycles of violence, threatening fragile efforts to rebuild the state.The deftness of Syria’s new president Sharaa’s diplomatic charm offensive has been stunning, especially coming from a former jihadi leader: forging a relationship with Donald Trump, easing US sanctions on Syria and becoming a fixture at international conferences.View image in fullscreenDonald Trump received Ahmed al-Sharaa at the White House on 10 November.Photograph: Balkis Press/Abaca/ShutterstockScenes of Sharaa meeting Trump and Syria’s return to the global stage have filled many Syrians with pride. “Even if I don’t like him, it feels good to see Syria in the White House,” one Alawite activist said while watching footage of Trump spraying Sharaa with perfume in the Oval Office in November.For the global community, a pro-western strongman in Damascus is a breath of fresh air. After 14 years of civil war that flooded the Middle East and Europe with drugs, created the world’s largest displacement crisis since the second world war and allowed Islamic State to establish a caliphate, the world has been eager to unite behind the new Syrian president.Sharaa gained power in part by capitalising on a weakened Iranian axis after Israel’s assault on Hezbollah in Lebanon prevented Tehran from saving its Syrian client, Assad. Sharaa has since managed to keep Iranian elements from re-establishing themselves in Syria, much to the delight of western capitals.But at home, stalled transitional justice is fuelling renewed violence and deepening the country’s divides.View image in fullscreenPeople in the city of Qamishli gather for a protest against a wave of sectarian violence targeting Syria’s Alawite minority, in March.Photograph: Delil Souleiman/AFP/Getty ImagesFour days of massacres perpetrated by government forces and other armed factions against mostly Alawite civilians on Syria’s coast in March and continued killings have left the religious minority feeling besieged.Another massacre in July in which members of government security forces and tribal elements killed Druze civilians in the southern province of Sweida further put the country’s religious and ethnic minorities on edge.Since the massacres, Sweida has been virtually sealed off from the rest of the country. The province’s people have hardened their positions against Damascus and rallied around the hardline Druze leader Hikmat al-Hijri, who demands autonomy.One Druze resident of Sweida, 33-year-old Bahaa, was suspicious initially but open to the country’s new leadership. But since the July massacres, the former government employee carries a gun and refuses to leave Sweida.View image in fullscreenBlack smoke billows near Sweida, where military units were deployed after sectarian clashes, in July 2025.Photograph: Getty ImagesThe Syrian government has launched a council for civil peace and a body to oversee transitional justice in the country. The tasks ahead of them are momentous: untangling ownership of appropriated property and establishing justice for crimes committed during the civil war while maintaining social cohesion.In mid-November, Syrian authorities carried out a public trial of Assad loyalists and members of the new security forces accused of violence during the March coastal massacres. Hooded and shackled figures were trotted out in front of cameras as justice officials boasted of the first trial of security officials in modern Syria’s history.View image in fullscreenPeople follow the proceedings of the first trial of more than a dozen suspects linked to massacres that left hundreds dead in Syria’s Alawite coastal heartland.Photograph: Bakr Alkasem/AFP/Getty Images“The court is sovereign and independent,” said the presiding judge, Zakaria Baccour, though its decision was postponed for a second session in December.Authorities have also carried out small, local initiatives aimed at giving victims a measure of peace of mind.

The area was picked clean by Assad-linked militias during the civil war.In July, security forces arrested one of the men responsible for the massacre, Hassan Dawa, and brought him back to the site of the crime. There they had him re-enact the killings and confess why he had committed the crime while Abdallah and others watched.“We felt like we wanted to kill him but the security didn’t let us. I felt much better after that, I felt some relief,” Abdallah said.View image in fullscreenFormer personnel from the Assad regime or militias get temporary IDs in a reconciliation centre where a portrait of Bashar al-Assad is used as a doormat.Photograph: David Lombeida/The GuardianHe sat with 11 members of his extended family in front of a barrel fire – they were crammed into a single room while they worked to repair their homes. The entire neighbourhood had been levelled by Assad militias who stripped buildings of copper, pipes and masonry to sell for scrap.“Theshabiha[pro-Assad militia men],the ones that did this, were from that neighbourhood over there,” Abdallah said, pointing to an intact housing block 100 metres away. “Theshabihaare still there, but there are good people living there too.”Activists say the government has failed to outline a national strategy for transitional justice. The bodies dedicated to pursuing accountability remain underfunded. If the slow pace of transitional justice is maintained, the activists warn, the brief window to deliver justice will close.“After all these months, the state is strengthening, external relations are improving, things are calming,” said Alaa Ibrahim, a civilian activist in Homs who works on social cohesion. “But now we’re a year into the liberation, if assassinations keep happening every day, where will that leave us?”View image in fullscreenSoldiers conduct checks during a temporary curfew in Homs after a double killing last month.Photograph: Abobaker Alsaka/Anadolu/Getty ImagesThe question of justice is now inseparable, many Syrians say, from a broader debate over the shape of the new, post-Assad Syrian state.Syria’s new social contract is still being written and the actions of Syria’s new authorities are beginning to define the values that will govern the relationship between a population and a state that for the last half-century has ruled through fear.There is no question that Syrians are enjoying a newfound freedom that would have been impossible to imagine a year earlier. “A year ago, people wouldn’t dare complain about the price of a kilo of onions. Now they are calling for ministers to resign,” Ayman Ali quipped.But civil society activists warn there is little mention of democracy in the new Syria, a key demand of revolutionaries over the last 14 years. Syria’s new constitution vests vast powers in the presidency while an “election” for the country’s parliament was held without a popular vote. Instead, committees appointed candidates for two-thirds of the legislative body and the president appointed the remaining third.View image in fullscreenSyria’s interim president, Ahmed al-Sharaa, centre, prepares to sign a temporary constitution in Damascus in March.Photograph: Omar Albam/APActivists complain of the new political affairs bureau, an opaque institution that has taken over the old Ba’ath party buildings throughout the country and appears to function as a new political security apparatus.One lawyer who runs social cohesion workshops said officials sat in on meetings and asked to approve their curriculum before a permit was given for their organisation to operate.Radwan Ziadeh, a Syrian writer who is close to Syria’s president, said: “There are some institutions which give you an indication that they are trying to build a more authoritarian system.“They don’t allow political parties to operate. No one can organise any political meetings without taking permission from the bureau [of political affairs].”View image in fullscreenSyrians celebrate the first anniversary of the ousting of the Assad regime in Damascus in the early hours of Saturday.Photograph: Ghaith Alsayed/APBack in Damascus, Ali lies back in his recovery bed, taking stock of the new Syria that he fought to build. The fact that Syria is stable a year after the cessation of 14 years of civil war feels like “a miracle”, he says, even if he has not got the justice he once dreamed of.But the shadow of Assad’s crimes still looms large over Ali and over Syria, as the lure of revenge threatens the country’s suddenly bright future.“If every person took justice into their own hands, the country would collapse,” he said, his remaining eye fixed steadily ahead. “We’ve spent 14 years exhausted, displaced. Either we throw that away or we build a state.”Explore more on these topicsFall of Assad: one year onSyriaMiddle East and north AfricaBashar al-AssadnewsShareReuse this content"

Some have been told to avoid sharing sensitive information because of the risk it could be collected and exploited.The US military declined to comment when asked about Israeli surveillance activities. The Israeli military declined to comment on Frank’s demand to halt recording and noted that conversations inside the CMCC are unclassified.“The IDF documents and summarises meetings in which it is present through protocols, as any professional organisation of this nature does in a transparent and agreed upon manner,” the Israeli military said in a statement.“The claim that the IDF is gathering intelligence on its partners in meetings which the IDF is an active participant is absurd.”View image in fullscreenScreens displaying maps and imagery of the Gaza Strip at the CMCC.Photograph: Amir Levy/Getty ImagesThe CMCC was set up in October to monitor the ceasefire, coordinate aid and draw up plans for Gaza’s future under Donald Trump’s 20-point plan to halt the war. Giant copies of that document are on display around the building.Soldiers stationed there were tasked with supporting an increase in essential supplies into Gaza, which formed part of the agreement.Israel has regularly restricted or prevented shipments of food, medicine and other humanitarian goods into Gaza. A complete siege this summer tipped parts of the territory into famine.When the CMCC began operations, US and Israeli mediareportedthat Israel was ceding authority over what entered the territory to the US military.Two months into the ceasefire, Washington has considerable leverage but Israel retains control of Gaza’s perimeter and what enters the territory, according to one US official.“We didn’t take over [aid],” he said, speaking on condition of anonymity. “It is an integration. It is hand in glove. They ([The Israelis] remain the hand, and the CMMC have become the glove over that hand,” the official said.View image in fullscreenTrucks carrying aid wait at the Israeli side of the Kerem Shalom border crossing to southern Gaza.Photograph: Hannah McKay/ReutersAmong the US forces deployed to the CMCC were logistics experts experienced in navigating natural disasters or trained to find supply routes through hostile terrain.They arrived keen to boost flows of aid but soon discovered that Israeli controls on goods entering Gaza were a bigger obstacle than engineering challenges. Within weeks, several dozen had left.Diplomats say discussions at the CMCC have been essential in persuading Israel to modify lists of supplies barred or restricted from entering Gaza on the grounds they are “dual use”, or could be repurposed for military as well as humanitarian purposes. They include basics such as tent poles and chemicals needed for water purification.The Dutch foreign minister, David van Weel, said he was briefed at the CMCC about “one of the dual-use barriers that was being lifted as a result of the conversations [there]”.Other items, such as pencils and paper needed to restart schools, have been banned from shipment into Gaza without explanationPalestinians excludedThe CMCC brings together military planners from the US, Israel and other allied countries including the UK and the United Arab Emirates.Diplomats posted to Israel and occupiedPalestineand humanitarian organisations operating in Gaza have also been invited to join discussions on aid supplies and the territory’s future.Trump’s plan recognises Palestinian aspirations to a state and commits to giving Palestinians seats in a temporary administration, but they are comprehensively excluded from the CMCC.There are no representatives of Palestinian civilian or humanitarian organisations, or the Palestinian Authority, stationed there invited to join discussions.Even efforts to bring Palestinians into talks through video calls were repeatedly cut off by Israeli officials, sources involved in or briefed on discussions said.US military planning documents seen by the Guardian avoid any use of the words Palestine or Palestinian, instead referring to the residents of the territory as “Gazans”.Israel’s prime minister,Benjamin Netanyahu, has presented the CMCC as a purely bilateral project. In a statement issued after visiting the base last month he described the centre as a “joint Israeli-American effort”, and did not mention other partners, and official photos of the visit showed only Israelis and Americans.An Israeli military source said the visit was organised outside working hours for security reasons and the US military decided which counterparts should attend.Dystopian startupThe CMCC is based in a multistorey building in the industrial zone of Kiryat Gat, a nondescript town about 12 miles (20km) from the border with Gaza.It was previously used by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, whosefood distribution sites became death traps for hundreds of Palestinians. Some branded products from the now-disbanded GHF are still piled up in the basement.Israelis and Americans have a floor each, and there are offices for key allies.The inside has the feel of a dystopian startup. A cavernous, windowless main hall has been carpeted with astroturf, and clusters of whiteboards divide the floor space into informal meeting areas where soldiers mix with diplomats and aid workers.The language of corporate America has arrived with the country’s troops. Palestinians in Gaza are sometimes referred to as “end users”, and blithely insensitive mnemonics are used to help some teams direct their efforts.“Wellness Wednesdays” focused on restoring Gaza’s hospitals, which have come underrelentlessattack, and schools that have not operated for two years.“Thirsty Thursdays” are for public services, in a place where children have been killed trying to collect water and the lack of sanitation is spreading disease.Many diplomats and aid workers are deeply wary of being at the CMCC.They are concerned the centre may break international law, excludes Palestinians from planning their own future, operates without a clear international mandate and mixes military and humanitarian work.But they also fear staying away would leave discussions about Gaza’s future solely in the hands of Israel and the newly arrived US military planners, who have very little knowledge about Gaza or the broader political context they are trying to influence.“We are really unsure how much time and energy to invest,” said one. “But this is the only chance we have of [the Americans] listening to us”.View image in fullscreenUS central command chief Adm Brad Cooper (left) and IDF chief Lt Gen Eyal Zamir (centre) talk to Benjamin Netanyahu.Photograph: Maayan Toaf/GPOThe CMCC’s role may already be waning, as dozens of US military personnel sent there in October have returned to home bases after their remit was officially completed, sources said.Designing an abstract future for Gaza in a political vacuum that excludes Palestinians appears to have been far more straightforward than past attempts to negotiate. It is unclear how much of the planning done in the CMCC will be tested in Gaza.Israel says the ceasefire will not move to a next stage until Hamas has been demilitarised, and neither the US nor its allies have a plan for how to achieve something that Israeli troops could not manage despite two years of brutal attacks.A UN commission of inquiry found earlier this year that Israel was committing genocide in Gaza, as have numerous humanitarian organisations.Asked about a timeline for implementing plans drawn up at the CMCC, the US official declined to provide one. “The US military is not at the heart of this,” he said. “It falls more into the political world.”Explore more on these topicsIsraelBenjamin NetanyahuGazaPalestineEspionageMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

The venue’s general manager, as well as the owners and event organisers, were all arrested and charged by police on Sunday.Tourists among at least 25 killed in Goa nightclub fireRead moreFive Indian tourists, from Delhi and the state of Karnataka, were also named among the dead. They included the four family members, three sisters and one of their husbands, who had travelled from Delhi for a holiday and had just finished up eating dinner at the club.Speaking to the Hindustan Times, family friend Harish Singh said that as the fire broke out and people began to panic, the family realised one of their sisters was still inside and rushed back to save her.0:54Fire at nightclub in Goa kills at least 25 people – video“The sisters rushed inside, followed by Vinod to save their kin. Everyone was running around and some people were stuck in kitchen,” Singh said. “The family tried to escape but couldn’t come out as everyone was pushing each other and there were no proper exits.”Only one of the four sisters had survived. “They were all very excited for the trip, it was their first trip to Goa,” Singh said.According to a technical evaluation of the incident, the venue – which was largely made of highly flammable wood and bamboo – had violated multiple safety regulations, including hosting a live music show that had pyrotechnics at the time the blaze broke out.Investigators are still determining if sparks from the show’s fireworks caused the fire, or if it was faulty electrics or a short circuit which set it off.“Prima facie observations indicate possible short-circuiting in electrical systems located above the main stage, supported by combustible internal furnishings,” the initial report said.The emergency response was also hampered by the narrow lanes to access the nightclub, which had promoted itself as an “island venue” in inland north Goa.The state government has also formed a high-level committee to inquire into the incident, and the report will be submitted within a week.Explore more on these topicsIndiaSouth and central AsianewsShareReuse this content"

I’m immensely proud to unveil the new look for Great British Railways as we deliver landmark legislation to nationalise our trains and reform the railway so it better serves passengers.“This isn’t just a paint job – it represents a new railway, casting off the frustrations of the past and focused entirely on delivering a proper public service for passengers.“With fares frozen, a bold new look and fundamental reforms becoming law, we are building a railway Britain can rely on and be proud of.”View image in fullscreenThe Department for Transport says the double arrow symbol is a ‘nod to Britain’s proud railway heritage’.Photograph: Department for TransportSeven of England’s former private train operatorsare already back in public hands, covering a third of all passenger journeys in Great Britain, with the rest due to renationalised by the end of 2027.

We could definitely look to the bus franchising bill and all of that wonderful stuff that’s coming out, but we need transport and education to be working together to do that.”Amanda Hopgood, chair of the children, young people and families committee at the Local Government Association, agreed: “It’s assisted travel to school, as opposed to home-to-school transport.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

So that has required work to show that actually that’s no longer beneficial for that young person.”Anna Bird, chief executive officer at Contact, a charity for families with disabled children, raised concerns about access to home-to-school transport for 16 to 19 year-olds, which is being cut by councils because it is discretionary.“We would want to make the point that there will be some children who will always need support to get to school, no matter how local, and that the system needs to provide for these children. There needs to be a fair system based on need, not age.”Sarah Hall, Labour MP for Warrington South, described what parents and carers of children with Send in her constituency had told her during a recent roundtable.“Parents feel they have to fight for support every step of the way,” she said. “They find it demoralising. They feel like parents’ voices need to be heard more. They feel like it’s a very complex system and information about entitlements are not always clear.

Days earlier, the council had served an eviction notice to those fighting to save the shelter, claiming their occupation was illegal.This marked the latest escalation following a week-long sit-in at the Sheringham bus shelter on Station Approach near the heritage railway station, afterNorfolkcounty council said it would demolish and replace the site due to accessibility and safety concerns.A campaign by local people has been calling for the preservation of their “beloved” bus shelter, arguing it is an important part of Sheringham’s heritage.Liz Withington, a councillor for the smaller North Norfolk district, was alerted to the arrival of bailiffs on Monday after receiving messages from campaigners at the shelter.“I was called and I got there within 10 minutes but initially there were three people sort of dozing and one was well asleep [when the officials] came in,” Withington said. “[They] came in and just told them that they’ve ‘got to get out’ and started being quite intimidatory.”A standoff between campaigners and the enforcement officials ensued, with protesters successfully manoeuvring past two security guards into the shelter, Withington said. The officials eventually left the vicinity, but spent the morning watching campaigners from their car across the street.“Enforcement officers [were] sitting very intimidatingly across the road from us, so we can’t leave the shelter or even go to the loo,” Withington said.The local Liberal Democrat MP, Steff Aquarone, expressed concerns that their behaviour was “intimidating” and alerted Norfolk constabulary. The force confirmed this was the case.The MP and about 20 campaigners have questioned the legality of the demolition and the eviction notice, arguing the shelter is owned by Sheringham town council. A meeting is due to take place to discuss the future of the shelter.“I think it’s totally inspiring and I stand shoulder to shoulder with them. This is about more than just a bus shelter,” Aquarone said. “This is about being heard and a local authority that has behaved in not just an arrogant way, but in a bullying way and they have lost the PR battle.”Protesters have been operating a rota system to ensure the shelter is always occupied. They began their sit-in on 1 December after spotting workmen arriving at the site.“[Campaigners] were about to have a meeting in the local pub to discuss what they were going to do when they realised the demolition team were arriving,” she said. “So they shot into the bus shelter and then started calling everybody.”Since then, Withington said the campaign had garnered a lot of support from locals, with several people bringing protesters food and drink.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And there are only, we believe, between four and six left in the country,” she said. “People have met at the bus shelter, people have sat waiting with grandmas and grandads for buses when they were little.”More than 3,000 people have now signedthe petition to stop the demolition. Withington said she believes the council have “disregarded” the views of residents, who are open to a compromise that improves the area but does not demolish the shelter.“The local voice is not being heard and not being listened to. [The council] wouldn’t come to the table and discuss it or consider any compromise. It’s [their] way or the highway,” she said.A spokesperson for the county council said the authority “stood bailiffs down at 10am” and that no work would take place on the bus shelter until after a town council meeting on Tuesday.The spokesperson added: “The land is owned by Sheringham town council but Norfolk county council currently have control and management of all parts of the site during the construction of the scheme, and our legal experts have advised that the eviction notice issued is entirely lawful.”Explore more on these topicsNorfolkLocal politicsEnglandLocal governmentfeaturesShareReuse this content"

West Sussex county council, which is leading the clearup operation, urged people to stay away. It said it needed time and room to clear containers – and bananas – away.The saga began on Saturday when16 containers went overboardfrom the refrigerated cargo ship Baltic Klipper in the Solent, the stretch of water between the Isle of Wight and the British mainland.The incident disrupted some shipping movements and the P&O Cruises ship Iona was delayed in departing from Southampton because of it.Eight of the containers were reported as carrying bananas, two plantains and one avocados. The remaining five were empty. Some have broken open, allowing bunches of bananas to float on to the beaches.View image in fullscreenWest Sussex county council urged people to stay away to give it room and time for the cleanup operation.Photograph: Jamie Lashmar/PA MediaThe coastguard, alongside West Sussex fire and rescue service and Sussex police, put cordons in place and asked people not to go nearby.Initially, the coastguard put out a statement reminding people that “all wreck material found in the UK has to be reported to HM Coastguard’s receiver of wreck”.It pointed people in the direction ofa form they needed to followand said those who failed to declare items within 28 days were breaking the law and could be fined £2,500.The receiver of the wreck made headlines in 2007 when containers washed offthe beached cargo ship MSC Napoliand made land in Devon.People arrived from across the UK to scavenge motorbikes, carpets, beauty creams, shoes, golf clubs, oil paintings,even oak wine barrels(which made it feel more Whisky Galore!).View image in fullscreenParts of a container that has washed ashore on Selsey beach in West Sussex.Photograph: Jamie Lashmar/PAThis time the receiver, a former police detective called Steve White, is not needed. As the goods involved are perishable, he is not getting involved.The Baltic Klipper was loaded with fruit in South America in mid-November. Itdocked in Mexico and the Netherlandsbefore heading towards Portsmouth. It was close to the Hampshire port when the containers apparently slipped off.The coastguard has been searching for the missing containersusing helicopters and fixed-wing planes.West Sussex county council warned people to stay away from containers that had made land. “Do not approach the containers, they may be hazardous. Please avoid the area. Allow us to make the site safe,” it said.⚠️ Public safety notice:Following an incident yesterday, two large shipping containers have washed up on Selsey beach. We are currently cordoning off the area:Do not approach the containers they may be hazardousPlease avoid the areaAllow us to make the site safe⚠️— West Sussex County Council (@WSCCNews)December 7, 2025It is believed the bananas were heading to UK supermarkets, with Tesco labels spotted on some.The supermarket insisted there was no need to panic: it had a good availability of bananas available in store and online.West Sussex county council, Arun district council and Chichester district council said on Monday evening that 11 containers had now washed ashore: seven in Selsey, two at Pagham Harbour, and two at Bognor Regis.A spokesperson said: “The three local authorities are grateful to those members of the public who have aided so far in helping to clear the fruit that has come ashore but would continue to urge people to avoid the area while the clearup takes place, as there may be fragments of metal from the damaged containers along the shoreline.“There is also a strong warning to everyone that the fruit that has come ashore may be unfit for consumption. Anyone who has taken fruit home is advised to discard it immediately.”Explore more on these topicsWest SussexEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

It also dismissed the nurse’s claim against Upton, whose evidence was held to be “more reliable and materially more cohesive in nature”.The judgment was immediately attacked by gender-critical campaigners as “disappointing” for failing to provide employers with clarity on the practical application of April’ssupreme court ruling on biological sex.The case revolved around a disputed incident which took place in a changing room at Victoria hospital in Kirkcaldy on Christmas Eve 2023, after which Upton made an allegation of bullying and harassment and cited concerns about patient care, leading to Peggie being placed on special leave.Peggie lodged a claim against both Upton and NHS Fife, citing the Equality Act 2010, including sexual harassment, harassment related to a protected belief, indirect discrimination and victimisation.The employment tribunal in Dundee heard two tranches of evidence in February and July, before Judge Sandy Kemp.In an interim statement, Peggie said she was “beyond relieved and delighted” at the harassment finding, adding that “the last two years have been agonising for me and my family”. She is expected to make a more detailed response later this week.The 312-page ruling found that NHS Fife had harassed Peggie by not revoking Upton’s permission to use the women’s changing room on an interim basis after her initial complaint until different work rotas for the pair could take effect.It also found the board took an “unreasonable” length of time to investigate the patient care allegations, that she had walked out on a patient in order to avoid Dr Upton. Although they emerged in January 2024, it was not until July 2025 that NHS Fife confirmed Peggie had beencleared of the separate gross misconduct allegationsafter an 18-month internal process.The ruling questioned the credibility of some of Peggie’s evidence such as seeking to distance herself from offensive remarks about Pakistan flood victims, but also dismissed other attacks on her professional performance, describing her “unblemished 30-year career until the Christmas Eve incident”.Addressing comments Peggie made to Upton during the Christmas Eve incident using language she “knew, or ought reasonably to have known, would be offensive”, the judgment concluded that “transphobic” was not a term of law and accepted as “entirely genuine” the nurse’s concern “that a person she regarded as male was entering a space she regarded as one that was private for those who were biologically female”.A hearing to determine what legal remedy is due Peggie will be fixed for a later date.The case has been followed closely across the UK to see howApril’s supreme court rulingthat “woman” and “sex” in the Equality Act refer only to a biological woman and to biological sex.Kemp argued in his judgment that the supreme court ruling was “not determinative” for changing room use. “It may be lawful to grant permission to a trans person to use the changing room that aligns with the sex and gender they identify as having, dependent on the circumstances.”He concluded that that decision did not result in it being inherently unlawful for a trans female, who is biologically male under the Equality Act, to be given permission to use a female changing room at work. Conversely, having the protected characteristic of gender reassignment did not mean that permission to use the changing room was necessarily lawful.Peggie’s solicitor, Margaret Gribbon, described the tribunal’s finding as“a huge win for a tenacious and courageous woman standing up for her sex-based rights”.But Maya Forstater, the head of the sex-based rights charity Sex Matters, said that “overall we are disappointed in the tribunal’s approach, which sought to reach a spurious ‘balance’ between a woman’s right to undress with privacy and dignity and the right of an employee with the protected characteristic of gender reassignment not to be discriminated against in employment.“The case demonstrates that employers with ambiguous policies are putting themselves in legal jeopardy. But the tribunal has failed to provide them with the clarity they need in order to be confident that they can simply and clearly say ‘No’ to men who want to use women’s spaces.”Susan Smith, a co-director of the campaign group For WomenScotland, which brought the case against the Scottish government that resulted in the supreme court ruling, said: “Tribunal courts should not be trying to overwrite the judgment of the highest court in the UK.NHS Fife, which has been criticised for spending at least £220,500 defending the case, said it would take time to work through the detail of the judgment.“We want to recognise how difficult this tribunal has been for everyone directly and indirectly involved. Our focus now is to ensure that NHS Fife remains a supportive and inclusive environment for all employees and our patients and to deliver health and care to the population of Fife,” it said.The ruling comes a week after a female employee who objected to trans women using the female toilets at Leonardo UK’s office in Edinburgh lost her discrimination claim against the firm. An employment tribunal ruled the toilet policy was a “proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim” to create an inclusive workplace environment for trans staff.Jess O’Thomson, the trans rights lead for the non-profit Good Law Project, said both rulings countered the argument that the supreme court ruling automatically resulted in a bathroom ban for trans people. “The tribunal was clear that the law does not now require banning trans people from single-sex spaces.”Explore more on these topicsTransgenderNHSScotlandHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

It’s him, 100%,” an officer was heard saying on body-worn camera video from Mangione’s arrest on 9 December last year, punctuating the remark with expletives as the officer combing the bag, Christy Wasser, held up the magazine.Wasser, a 19-year Altoona police veteran, testified on the fourth day of a pre-trial hearing as Mangione sought to bar prosecutors from using the magazine and other evidence against him, including a 9mm handgun and a notebook found during a subsequent bag search.The testimony shed light on the critical minutes after Mangione was spotted at the McDonald’s and the sometimes unusual steps police officers took in collecting evidence critical to tying him to the crime.Mangione’s lawyers argue the items should be excluded because police did not have a search warrant and lacked the grounds to justify a warrantless search. Prosecutors contend the search was legal and that police eventually obtained a warrant.Wasser, testifying in full uniform, said Altoona police protocols require promptly searching a suspect’s property at the time of an arrest, in part for dangerous items.On body-worn camera video played in court, Wasser was heard saying she wanted to check the bag for bombs before removing it from the McDonald’s. Despite that concern, she acknowledged in her testimony Monday that police never cleared the restaurant of customers or employees.Mangione, 27, has pleaded not guilty to state and federal murder charges. He appeared in good health on Monday, pumping his fist for photographers and chatting with his lawyers as testimony resumed.The hearing, which was postponed on Friday because of Mangione’s apparent illness, applies only to the state case. His lawyers are making a similar push to exclude the evidence from his federal case, where prosecutors are seeking the death penalty.Prosecutors have said the handgun found in the backpack matches the firearm used in the killing and that writings in the notebook showed Mangione’s disdain for health insurers and ideas about killing a CEO at an investor conference.Thompson, 50, was killed as he walked to a Manhattan hotel for his company’s investor conference. Surveillance video showed a masked gunman shooting him from behind. Police have said “delay,” “deny” and “depose” were written on the ammunition, mimicking a phrase used to describe how insurers avoid paying claims.Mangione was arrested in Altoona, about 230 miles from Manhattan, after police there received a 911 call.Wasser testified that she went to the McDonald’s on her own to assist another officer, Joseph Detwiler. Before that, she said, she had seen some coverage of Thompson’s killing on Fox News.Wasser began searching Mangione’s bag as officers took him into custody on initial charges of forgery and false identification, after he acknowledged giving them a bogus driving license, police said. The same fake name was used by the alleged gunman used at a Manhattan hostel days before the shooting.By then, a handcuffed Mangione had been informed of his right to remain silent – and invoked it – when asked if there was anything officers should be concerned about.Wasser told another officer she wanted to check the bag for a bomb before leaving the McDonald’s because she didn’t want to repeat an incident in which another Altoona officer had inadvertently brought a bomb to the police station.“Did you call the bomb squad?” Mangione lawyer Karen Friedman Agnifilo asked.“No. I didn’t find a bomb yet,” Wasser said.According to body-worn camera video, the first few items Wasser found were innocuous: a hoagie, a loaf of bread and a smaller bag containing a passport, cellphone and computer chip.Then she pulled out a gray pair of underwear, unwrapping them to reveal the magazine.Satisfied there was no bomb, she suspended her search and placed some of the items back in the bag. Some evidence, including Mangione’s laptop, was transported to the police station in a brown paper bag, body-worn camera video showed.Wasser resumed her search after an 11-minute drive to the police station and almost immediately found the gun and silencer — the latter discovery prompting her to laugh and exclaim “nice”, according to footage. Wasser said the gun was in a side pocket that she had not searched at McDonald’s. Later, while cataloging everything in the bag, she found the notebook.“Isn’t it awesome?” Wasser said at one point during the search.Asked to explain, she told Friedman Agnifilo that she was proud of her police department’s work in helping to capture Thompson’s suspected killer.A Blair county, Pennsylvania, prosecutor testified that a judge later signed off on a search warrant for the bag, a few hours after the searches were completed. The warrant, she said, provided a legal mechanism for Altoona police to turn the evidence over to New York detectives.As he has throughout the case, assistant district attorney Joel Seidemann described Thompson’s killing as an “execution” and referred to his notebook as a “manifesto” – terms that Mangione’s lawyers said were prejudicial and inappropriate.Judge Gregory Carro said the wording had “no bearing” on him, but warned Seidemann that he’s “certainly not going to do that at trial” when jurors are present.Explore more on these topicsBrian Thompson shootingNew YorkPennsylvanianewsShareReuse this content"

A screenshot of the post began circulating onRedditlast Thursday and garnered over 500 comments. The post and the account were removed by Instagram by Friday morning, according toJ., the Jewish News of Northern California.The school’s principal, Beth Silbergeld, told the Guardian in a written statement that the social media post was reported to an anonymous tip line on Wednesday evening.She also shared that the school will not be sharing the identities of the students who participated or the disciplinary action taken against them, in accordance with federal laws.“While this incident does not reflect the values of the vast majority of our students and families, the harm it caused is real and must be addressed,” Silbergeld said in the statement. “Many in our community were rightly appalled by the image. This incident is troubling and unacceptable. Professionally, we are committed to learning from this moment and moving forward with greater unity and purpose.”She added: “Our message to the community is clear: this was a disturbing and unacceptable act of antisemitism. Actions that target, demean, or threaten Jewish students have no place on our campuses. CUHSD [Campbell Union High School District] and Branham stand firmly against all forms of hate, discrimination, and intolerance.”Representatives from the Bay Area Jewish Coalition (BAJC), a grassroots organization dedicated to ensuring the safety of Jewish Bay Area residents, shared that the impact of the social media post has reverberated beyond San Jose.“To have children echoing Hitler’s words is frankly just shocking and heartbreaking, and the entire community has been rocked by this,” Tali Klima, a BAJC spokesperson, said. “This bold and premeditated display has really shaken everyone.”Maya Bronicki, BAJC’s education lead, attributed the incident in part to a lack of proper Holocaust education and historical context on hate symbols, such as the swastika. “We have absolute faith that if the district takes actual measures to teach students the right lessons about being inclusive and anti-hate, that Jews are a minority that deserve compassion and understanding and deserve to be equal to everyone else in this education system, then that would be a huge step towards tomorrow’s society,” she said.The school district is planning to work with BAJC, as well as the Anti-Defamation League and the Jewish Community Relations Council of the Bay Area to address and repair harm caused by the incident.Explore more on these topicsCaliforniaWest CoastAntisemitismnewsShareReuse this content"

But it did not agree to acquire WBD’s traditional television assets, including the news network CNN and the Discovery channel.Paramount’s all-cash tender offer sent directly to shareholders on Monday morning would be for the entire company, and puts a total enterprise value of $108.4bn on WBD, a major premium to its stock price.‘This merger must be blocked’: Netflix-Warner Bros deal faces fierce backlashRead moreIn making its case to shareholders, Paramount claimed its acquisition of the company provides significantly better value for shareholders, and would be much likelier to survive regulatory scrutiny. WBD said it would “carefully review and consider” the bid, and advise its shareholders on how to respond within two weeks.David Ellison and his father, the billionaire tech mogul Larry Ellison, whose family is financially backing the offer, are both friendly with the Trump administration, which had previously indicated that it supported a Paramount purchase of WBD. Larry Ellison, founder of Oracle,had even had early conversationswith a senior Trump aide about what changes he might want to see at CNN.Donald Trump has praised recent changes at Paramount since its acquisition by the Ellisons, including theselection of the heterodox writer Bari Weissas editor in chief of CBS News. Paramount is also bringing back the Rush Hour franchise for a fourth film, reportedly at the request of Trump.Shortly before the Ellisons won regulatory approval for their takeover of Paramount, the firmagreed to pay$16m to settle a lawsuit filed by Trump, who had claimed a pre-election interview with the 2024 Democratic candidate for president, Kamala Harris, was falsely edited. Many legal experts had dismissed the lawsuit as “meritless” and unlikely to hold up under the first amendment.A regulatory filing on Monday revealed that the Ellisons’ bid for WBD was backed by outside funders including Affinity Partners, an investment fund founded by Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner; Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund; and the Qatar Investment Authority.In a statement, David Ellison called the Netflix deal “an inferior proposal which exposes shareholders to a mix of cash and stock, an uncertain future trading value of the Global Networks linear cable business and a challenging regulatory approval process”.“WBD shareholders deserve an opportunity to consider our superior all-cash offer for their shares in the entire company,” he said. “Our public offer, which is on the same terms we provided to the Warner Bros Discovery board of directors in private, provides superior value, and a more certain and quicker path to completion.”During an industry event on Monday afternoon, Netflix leaders expressed little concern about the Paramount bid. Netflix co-chief executive Ted Sarandos said the Paramount offer was “totally expected”. “We have a deal done, and we are really happy with the deal,” he added. “We’re super confident we are going to get it across.”Warner Bros Disaster? Netflix inks deal for troubled Hollywood giantRead moreEllison’s Paramount Skydance had already made several offers that were rejected during the bidding process for WBD. The company said on Monday it was concerned that shareholders “were not presented [the] most compelling and superior transaction”.Last week, attorneys for Paramount sent a letter to WBD suggesting the company was not fairly considering its offer. “It has become increasingly clear, through media reporting and otherwise, that WBD appears to have abandoned the semblance and reality of a fair transaction process, thereby abdicating its duties to stockholders, and embarked on a myopic process with a predetermined outcome that favors a single bidder,” they wrote.Netflix’sproposed acquisitionof the studio and streaming assets of WBD fleetingly provided some relief for some employees at CNN, who had been concerned about the prospects of a merger between the network and CBS News, now led by Weiss.“I think this is the best outcome for CNN for sure,” a senior network producer told the Guardian after the Netflix acquisition was announced, describing a “palpable sense of relief” at the network. But, the person added, “there is still a hell of a lot of anxiety around the Discovery Global spin-off and what comes next”.In a memo to CNN employees on Friday, the network’s CEO, Mark Thompson, framed the deal as a positive. “I’ve been asked by many of you what today’s news means for us,” he wrote. “And the answer is that it will enable us to continue to roll out our strategy to secure a great future for CNN by successfully navigating our digital transition.”Some employees at CBS News had also feared a merger with CNN’s parent company, and that a tie-up could lead to significant job losses. “A merger with CNN is the one thing that would make me genuinely worried about losing my job,” one CBS News staffer said. (Paramount’s offer on Monday noted that the combination of television networks would “dramatically improve cash flow and increase efficiencies, leading to a division more capable of managing structural declines”.)Paramount’s offer on Monday for WBD could re-ignite those concerns for employees at both networks. If the Netflix deal moves forward, however, CNN will be spun off – as planned – into a standalone company, encompassing WBD’s traditional television networks, from Cartoon Network to TLC.On a conference call with analysts, David Ellison did not answer a question about whether he would be interested in acquiring the television group by itself if the greater Netflix deal goes through.On Sunday evening, before Paramount tabled its hostile bid, Trump had said he would be personally involved in the review for the Netflix-WBD transaction, which he said would have implications for competition considering Netflix’s “big market share”. But he had kind words for Netflix’s co-chief executive Ted Sarandos, who visited the White House recently.Several US politicians, including Senator Elizabeth Warren, and entertainment unions, however,had expressed strong reservationsabout the deal.Because no television licenses would be transferred in a potential acquisition, the acquisition of WBD is very unlikely to be subject to the review of the Federal Communications Commission and its Trump-picked chair, Brendan Carr. But anti-trust concerns around any such deal would be reviewed by the Department of Justice.“Paramount is highly confident in achieving expeditious regulatory clearance for its proposed offer,” the company said on Monday, “as it enhances competition and is pro-consumer, while creating a strong champion for creative talent and consumer choice.”The Ellisons’ offer is set to expire at 5pm on 8 January, unless it is extended.On the Monday call, David Ellison said the company’s offers for WBD had not received a response. “We’re here to fight for value – for our shareholders and for WBD shareholders,” he said. “This transaction is about building more, not cutting back … Our proposal is superior to Netflix’s in every dimension.”While Trump has been very supportive of the Ellisons’ takeover of CBS News, he lashed out at the network and its new management on Monday morning for a 60 Minutes broadcast the night before, featuring the outgoing GOP House member Marjorie Taylor Greene,who told correspondent Lesley Stahlthat many Republican legislators privately mocked Trump.“My real problem with the show, however, wasn’t the low IQ traitor, it was that the new ownership of 60 Minutes, Paramount, would allow a show like this to air,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform. “THEY ARE NO BETTER THAN THE OLD OWNERSHIP, who just paid me millions of Dollars for FAKE REPORTING about your favorite President, ME! Since they bought it, 60 Minutes has actually gotten WORSE!”Explore more on these topicsBusinessWarner BrosNetflixnewsShareReuse this content"

Rates currently sit at a range of 3.75% to 4%.Although the committee started cutting the decades-high interest rates last fall, a majority consensus held off on cuts in the first half of the year, citing economic uncertainty from tariffs. The committee has since cut rates by a half-point after its September and October meetings, with a growing number of committee officials signaling there should be a third cut this year. Markets are expecting a final rate cut on Wednesday, but it’s unclear whether enough officials will agree on the move.The Fed has a dual mandate to stabilize prices and the labor market. Raising interest rates can steady prices: the Fed pushed rates up quickly when inflation hit 9.1% in 2022. But if the central bank isn’t careful, high interest rates can push up unemployment. The risk means setting interest rates is a delicate balancing act that has huge repercussions on the economy.In recent months, the Fed chair, Jerome Powell, has said officials are observing pressure from both sides of the Fed’s mandate. Both prices and unemployment are going up:inflationwent from 2.3% in April to 3% in September while theunemployment rateincreased from 4% in January to 4.4% in September.When explaining the Fed’s most recent rate cut in October, Powellsaidthat a majority of officials were more concerned about the labor market over inflation, but “we have one tool”.“We can’t do both of those at once. People have different forecasts … and they have different levels of risk aversion,” Powell said, noting that much of the division in October was over how officials seemed to be thinking about a December rate cut.Because of the government shutdown, the collection of October’s data was cancelled, and November’s price and labor market data will be released later in December. While it is unclear whether more data would have built a stronger consensus, it would have given officials a clearer picture of the economy during a turbulent period.In October, Powell said the lack of data meant officials would need to proceed with caution in their December meeting.“What do you do if you’re driving in the fog? You slow down,” he said.Amid the internal debates on the upcoming Fed meeting, multiple reports have said Donald Trump iszeroing inon Kevin Hassett, a close ally to the president and his current director of the national economic council, as the potential next chair of the Fed. Powell, who was appointed by Trump in 2018 and was reappointed by Biden again in 2022, is facing the end of his term in May.Hassett has been one of the president’s staunch economic advocates over the past year, insisting that prices have been stable and that the White House’s tariffs have strengthened the economy. He has also been a vocal proponent of more rate cuts, which Trump believes will boost the economy without raising prices.This will be the eighth meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which has 12 members who vote on rate changes. The committee will announce its decision on Wednesday afternoon.Explore more on these topicsFederal ReserveUS economyUS politicsTrump administrationDonald TrumpEconomicsnewsShareReuse this content"

The head coach also insisted his politeness should not be mistaken for weakness after leaving Salah out of theChampions Leaguegame against Inter on Tuesday.Slot gave his first public ­reaction on Monday to Salah’s incendiary interview at Leeds when ­previewing ­Liverpool’s match at San Siro. He denied Salah’s claims that their relationship had broken down and said only the Egypt international knows who supposedly threw him under a bus and wants him out of the club.Self-indulgent Mohamed Salah betrays teammates and hastens end of Liverpool era | Andy HunterRead moreSalah trained on Monday for the second day in succession before Slot told him directly that he would not be travelling to Italy for the Champions League game. The decision to remove the 33-year-old from selection for a short period was taken by the Liverpool hierarchy in conjunction with Slot, and with the full support of the Dutch coach. Salah could also miss the home game against Brighton on Saturday. He is due to report for Africa Cup of Nations duty with Egypt on Monday and could be away from Liverpool until mid-January, when Saudi Arabian interest in the forward is likely to be rekindled.Asked whether there is a way back for Salah at Liverpool, who have the player under contract until the summer of 2027, Slot replied: “I am a firm believer that there is always a possibility to return for a player. But that is not … I can leave it with that I think.”The head coach, however, was pressed again on the possibility that the third highest goalscorer in Liver­pool’s history may have played his last game for the club. “I have no clue,” Slot replied. “I cannot answer that question at this point in time.”Slot said that he was taken aback by Salah’s comment that their once‑healthy relationship has broken down, having beenbenched for three consecutive gamesfor the first time in his Liverpool career. “That is not the way I feel, but he has the right to feel how he feels things,” Slot said.View image in fullscreenArne Slot said he was baffled by the claim that he had no relationship with Mohamed Salah.Photograph: Peter Byrne/PA“I haven’t felt that at all until Satur­day evening for sure. When I don’t play someone usually players don’t like the manager that much but he was really respectful to the staff and manager, his teammates and he trained very hard so it was a surprise to me when I heard the comments he gave. But it is not the first or last time a player who doesn’t play says something similar to what he did. But my reaction to that is clear and that’s why he is not here tonight.”Slot said it was difficult to know who Salah was referring to when he claimed someone at Liverpool had thrown him under a bus. But he admitted having only a brief exchange with the player since Saturday – when informing him of the decision to leave him behind on Merseyside – and insisted the club’s reaction demonstrated his authority.“Usually I’m calm, I’m polite,” Slot said. “But that doesn’t mean I’m weak so if a player has these comments about so many things then it’s up to me and the club to react. We reacted in a way you can see – he’s not here.”Liverpool would have been low on numbers against Inter even if Salah had been included on the trip. Cody Gakpo, Federico Chiesa and Wataru Endo are absent through illness and injury – Chiesa could fly out on the day of the game should he recover from illness, while Gakpo is out for a few weeks having picked up an injury against Leeds – leaving Slot with a squad of 19 players that includes three goalkeepers and three teenagers.The first-choice keeper Alisson also addressed the media on Monday and said he hoped Salah would play for Liverpool again. “I don’t think anything but I hope he plays again for the club,” he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Brazil international said: “Before Arne came in everyone talks about the huge challenge being a substitute for Jürgen Klopp. Now it looks like everyone takes for granted what we achieved last season. It should not be taken for granted. That should be enough but we believe in his knowledge. We believe in his style of play and that he is capable of helping us to turn around this situation.

Supporters, the manager, everyone at the club feels like they’re in the gutter and he’s chosen that time to go for the manager and maybe get him sacked.“I’d remind Salah and his agent that before he came to Liverpool he was known as the man who failed at Chelsea.

That run appears to be overOliver ConnollyMon 8 Dec 2025 06.45 ESTLast modified on Mon 8 Dec 2025 13.25 ESTShareThis is how great runs end. Not with a single catastrophic collapse, but with a slow drift towards the finish, looking old, tired and out of ideas. For the Chiefs, that sense of finality arrived on Sunday night, delivered by the Texans in a 20-10 defeat at home that felt more lopsided than the score.For much of this season, there had been a gnawing sense of inevitability about the Chiefs. Whether judging by the eye test or the advanced data, this year’s group has beenslightlybetter than the 15-win team who trudged through one-score victories last season, got hot in the playoffs and then were crushed by the Eagles in the Super Bowl. Even as the losses mounted this year, it felt like the Chiefs still had a run in them. If they could figure out their disjointed offense and find any juice on defense, they could sneak into the playoffs. And in a one-off game, with everything on the line, it would still be hard to look past the Andy Reid-Patrick Mahomes axis.Now the Chiefs sit at 6–7, staring at the standings with the grim realization that they are exactly what their record says they are: not that good. There will be analytics models insisting that the Chiefs remain top-10 in efficiency here or expected points there. But those numbers have become background noise in a season defined by drops, miscues and the erosion of their aura.Sunday in Arrowhead was the full excrement meets fan moment. The Chiefs didn’t just lose; they were rocked. Mahomes completed just 42.8% of his passes and connected on only two of 12 passes under pressure, as Houston’s relentless defensive front attacked a makeshift offensive line. The Texans were tougher, quicker, craftier and looked like a cohesive, if flawed, team. They have playmakers at every level of their defense, and all of themshowed up to fluster Mahomes.For the first time since 2021, Mahomes’ offense was shut out for an entire half of a regular season game.All Kansas City’s long-denied vulnerabilities bubbled up at once. Mahomes was picked off three times. The offense couldn’t reliably move the ball through the air or on the ground, again relying on the quarterback to lead the team in rushing to generate any pulse. Everything felt stale, with the same old recycled answers to the same old problems. This wasn’t a decade-long juggernaut stalling, but a fatigued organization rolling out exhausting ideas with an aging core and little clue about how to evolve.The defeat was, in many ways, a microcosm of the season. The Chiefs conceded multiple third-and-long conversions to CJ Stroud and the Texans’ offense. They missed a field goal. Receiver Tyquan Thornton failed to hold on to a long touchdown toss from Mahomes, one of six drops from the Chiefs’ pass-catchers – the most of any game in the Mahomes era. And then came a fourth-and-one failure, from deep inside the team’s own territory.Tied at 10-10 early in the fourth quarter, the Chiefs faced that fourth-and-one from their own 31-yard line. Reid, typically conservative, went for it. Mahomes’ pass hit the grass, the Texans took over in premium field position, and scored a touchdown to effectively seal the game.“I take full responsibility for that,” Reid said post-game. “I thought we could get it. I was wrong.”The call was telling. It was Reid admitting that he needed to do somethingdifferent, that his team doesn’t have the goods this season.The decline didn’t happen overnight. Behind Reid and Mahomes, the Chiefs have reached seven straight AFC Championship Games, winning three Super Bowls. Even at their weakest, they’ve found a way. But this season, 20 points, once a comical attempt at upsetting the Chiefs, has become the threshold that teams need merely to compete. The offense is stagnant. The defense is middling, even if it caused the Texans mediocre offensive line plenty of problems on Sunday. The long postseason runs, the accumulated hits, the personnel misfires, they’ve all taken their toll. Even dependable veterans reflect the problem. The 36-year-old Travis Kelce had been their most reliable third-down target until Sunday night. Kareem Hunt, 30, is their most effective running back. Those are not markers of a healthy roster.The Chiefs aren’t completely out of the playoff hunt yet. But they’re two games behind Houston and down on the tiebreaker. Either way, limping into January won’t fix anything. This team needs something bigger: a full reboot, the kind they embraced after being dismantled by the Buccaneers in the Super Bowl, when they rebuilt their entire offensive line in an offseason.What they need now is even more drastic – new weapons, ideas and energy. Mahomes has masked fundamental issues for years. But that is no longer enough. Stick a fork in this iteration of the Chiefs dynasty.View image in fullscreenJosh Allen was at his best in the snow on Sunday.Photograph: Jeffrey T Barnes/APMVP of the weekJosh Allen, QB, Buffalo Bills.We had snow in Buffalo! And it came with one of the greatest quarterback duels this season. Allen and Joe Burrow went toe-to-toe, throwing dart after dart in grim conditions. But it was Allen who made the biggest plays in the biggest moments, shredding a woeful Bengals defense to the tune of 329 total yards and four touchdowns with no turnovers in a 39-34 shootout win. Burrow matched Allen early, piling up an 11-point half-time lead, only to undo it all with a pair of interceptions on successive throws. Allen, again asked to bail the Bills out of trouble, responded as he always does. He engaged full MVP-mode, putting the team on his back while being hit or hurried on nearly half of his dropbacks. Every high-leverage moment belonged to him: third- and fourth-downs, broken pockets, busted plays. And then, to close it out, a third-and-15 scramble up the middle –ploughing his way to 18 yards to ice the game.The Bills, despite their flaky defense, move to 9-4, with a game against the division-leading Patriots on deck.Video of the weekA season can hinge on a decision. For the Ravens and Steelers, it may come down to an official’s decision. Make your own call: touchdown or no touchdown?You make the call: Ravens TE Isaiah LikelyTouchdown or incomplete?pic.twitter.com/YoGObodFpe— Bad Sports Refs (@BadSportsRefs)December 7, 2025In Pittsburgh, with Baltimore driving for a late lead, Lamar Jackson hit tight end Isaiah Likely in the endzone for a go-ahead score. But after initially being ruled a touchdown, the catch was overturned to an incomplete pass. No matter that Likely had control of the ball and took two steps. The officials ruled that he did not complete the process of a catch or make a “football move” by getting a third step down in time. The Ravens had two more shots from the 13 and came up empty, then staggered through a frantic final minute without finding the endzone. Pittsburgh escaped 27-22 and climbed to the top of the AFC North.Both teams showed their fragilities. The Steelers got Aaron Rodgers’ sharpest outing this season. He was decisive, clinical and willing to throw the ball downfield, completing his first pass over 20 yards since October.Rodgers even tacked on his first rushing touchdown since 2022. But Pittsburgh’s offense was tight in the fourth quarter and could only muster 27 points despite Rodgers’ best efforts, giving the Ravens the opening needed to get back into the game, but they came up short. If they miss the playoffs, they will spend a good chunk of the offseason thinking about the catch that wasn’t.View image in fullscreenDaniel Jones grabs his leg after his achilles injury.Photograph: Phelan M Ebenhack/APStat of the week8-5.That’s the Colts’ record after a week in which they slipped from the top of the AFC South to third place in the division, after losing to the Jaguars 36-19. After blowing teams away early in the year, their season is effectively done. Daniel Jonestore his achillesin the first quarter, ruling him out for the rest of the season and much of next year. It’s a devastating blow. Jones’s comeback was one of the stories of the year. He was in line for a $100m contract this offseason, with the Colts committed to the quarterback after trading away two first-round picks for Sauce Gardner at the trade deadline. Jones faces an arduous recovery. He was already playing with a fractured fibula in the opposite leg, and it’s a wonder why he was cleared to play to begin with. The Colts are out of options at quarterback, relying on sixth-round rookie Riley Leonard with Anthony Richardson on injured reserve with a fractured orbital bone. In the short term, it ends any hopes of a playoff run, and after dealing away the future, the medium-term outlook is murky at best.View image in fullscreenMike McDaniel isn’t quite done in Miami yet.Photograph: Yuki Iwamura/APElsewhere around the league-- Some games come down to a single play. After putting together a string of exceptional drives to force a one-score game against the Packers in Lambeau, the Bears failed to convert on a last-second fourth-down deep in Green Bay territory. With a chance to tie the game, Caleb Williams threw an interception in the endzone with 22 seconds left. It was a miserable decision in what was an otherwise electric performance from the Bears quarterback. Rolling out of the pocket, Williams had a first down open on a scramble. He had a touchdown pass open to Cole Kmet. But Williams threw a floater into the waiting hands of Packers corner Keisean Nixon, sealing a 28-21 win for Green Bay. The result moves Green Bay up to the No 2 seed in the NFC, while the Bears slide from the top spot to No 7.-- Mike McDaniel is saving his job in Miami. The Dolphins blew out the Jets 34-10 to extend their winning streak to four. Don’t look now, but the Dolphins are 6-7, matching the Ravens’ record and putting them only two wins behind the Colts. The Dolphins have a less than 1% chance of making the playoffs, given the depth of the AFC West, AFC South, as well as the Bills and Patriots. But if you planted them in the North, they’d be favorites to win the division. McDaniel looked like a sure-fire candidate to be bounced as soon as the season ended. But with a strong second half of the year, he may have bought himself another season with a new quarterback.-- How about Tyler Shough? The Saints rookie quarterback continues to prove that he’s more than a placeholder in a lost season. Shough ran for two touchdowns as the Saints beat the Bucs 24-20 on the road. In a monsoon, the Saints dragged the Bucs down into the mud. Baker Mayfield, harassed, hurried, and perpetually annoyed, never found a rhythm, completing just 14 of 30 pass attempts with an interception and a touchdown. The four-time defending NFC South champs have lost four of their last five games, slipping into a first-place tie with the Panthers. The Bucs and Panthers will play each other twice in their final three games, effectively a mini-playoff.-- Speaking of rookie quarterbacks, Shedeur Sanders put together the best performance of his young career. He became the first rookie quarterback this season to throw for 300-plus yards, converting 23 of 42 attempts in a 31-29 losing effort against the Titans. Sanders had one wayward interception and took a pair of drawn out sacks, two defining features of his game. But he looked more comfortable with the speed of the league, ripping off tight-window throws to every level of the field and extending plays when pressure crashed into the backfield. He found Jerry Jeudy with a 60-yard touchdown dart, joining Rodgers as the only quarterbacks since 2000 to have four completions of 50 yards or more in their first three starts. Sanders may be unpolished, but he continues to prove that he has a starter’s skill set despite the lack of talent around him.Explore more on these topicsNFLUS sportsKansas City ChiefsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I wouldn’t be honest with you if I didn’t say that they have done permanent damage to the relationship between the conference and Notre Dame,” Bevacqua said.“We didn’t appreciate the fact that we were singled out repeatedly and compared to Miami, not by Miami, but it raised a lot of eyebrows here that the conference was taking shots at us ... People might disagree with us, but that’s just not something we’d be comfortable with.”Notre Dame, who won their final 10 games after an 0-2 start that included a loss to Miami, were ahead of the Hurricanes throughout the College Football Playoff rankings until Miami jumped the Fighting Irish on Sunday to claim the final at-large bid.The Irish joined the ACC in all sports aside from football and hockey in 2013 and agreed in 2014 to play five football games against ACC opponents each season to fill out their schedule.The official ACC Football account on X posted a direct Miami-Notre Dame comparison graphic on 1 December with the caption, “The best part about football? You get to settle it on the field.”The ACC Network also rebroadcast Miami’s season-opening win over Notre Dame at least 13 times in the days leading up to the CFP field announcement.The ACC would have been excluded from the field – and missed out on a significant amount of money – had Miami not made it due to five-loss Duke winning the conference championship.Explore more on these topicsCollege footballCollege sportsUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

It did not reveal the size of the investment, but said Reynolds and McElhenney, who has changed his name to Rob Mac, would remain majority owners.The investment will help to finance the development of Wrexham’s Racecourse Ground (Y Cae Ras in Welsh), the club said. Apollo is one of the world’s largest investors, with as much as $840bn (£630bn) in assets under management. It has previously loaned money to the Premier League club Nottingham Forest.Wrexham AFC receives £18m from government despite Hollywood backingRead moreWrexham have risen up the English Football League to the Championship thanks to the backing of Hollywood owners Reynolds, the producer and star of theDeadpool film franchise, and McElhenney, the creator of the comedy series It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia. They have attracted big-name sponsors and multiplied the company’s valuation in part through aDisney TV documentary, Welcome to Wrexham, which has charted the team’s successive promotions.Apollo’s investment is likely to have been made more attractive by the prospect of significant government support. Wrexham AFC was awarded £14m in non-repayable grants on 17 September, after receiving £3.8m last year, according to state aid disclosures revealed last month by the Guardian.The deal is highly unusual in awarding a direct, non-repayable grant to a football club. No other club has received more than £2m in grants, according to the database. Other clubs have received significant support from local councils, but the councils usually retained ownership ofassets, including stadiums.The Apollo investment adds to questions over why the council argued that the club needed millions of pounds of government money, said Stefan Borson, a football finance expert and the head of sport at the law firm McCarthy Denning.“The investment from Apollo is a significant milestone and likely at a record pre-money valuation for a Championship club,” he said, referring to a report byBloombergthat Wrexham was valued at as much as £350m.“It confirms the commercial attraction of Wrexham to one of the largest investors in the world,” he said. “Alongside the existing owners, this provides the club with substantial funding for the development of the stadium and a push for the Premier League. However, in that context, the Apollo investment raises questions again as to why the Welsh government needed to provide £18m of non-repayable grant.”State aid disclosures, which appear to have been written by an officer of Wrexham county borough council, claimed there was “no incentive for the private sector to pursue the project” of redeveloping the stadium, and that developing to international standard would be “commercially unviable”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It has also attracted tens of millions of pounds in investment from the wealthy New York-based Allyn family.In a joint statement, McElhenney and Reynolds said: “From day one, we wanted to build a sustainable future for Wrexham AFC. And to do it with a little heart and humour. The dream has always been to take this club to the Premier League while staying true to the town.”Lee Solomon, an Apollo partner, said: “Wrexham is on an incredible journey, and we are thrilled to be a part of it and to support the club, the Wrexham community and Rob and Ryan. This is a multifaceted investment where Apollo Sports Capital can provide long-term, patient capital to help Wrexham reach its goals and to contribute to the ongoing revitalisation of the facilities and local economy.”Wrexham county borough council and the Welsh government were approached for comment. They have previously said that the investment was needed to prepare the stadium for international matches, which would provide benefits to the local economy.Explore more on these topicsWrexhamPrivate equityRyan ReynoldsWalesnewsShareReuse this content"

He finished in his lowest championship position of sixth place and is looking forward to the winter break and disconnecting from the sport as he attempts to reset and regroup.In the final race of the season in he qualified in 16th place and finished in eighth, while the young British driverLando Norris claimed his first world championship, the first Briton since Hamilton last did so in 2020.Lando Norris claims he was often unmatchable on way to F1 title gloryRead more“I can’t wait to get away from all this,” Hamilton said afterwards as he faced the media. “Every week, photoshoots and all that kind of stuff. That’s the thing I look forward to one day, not having to do it all.”The seven-time champion has cut a somewhat jaded and disconsolate figure over the last rounds of his most trying season and said he wanted to step back, which will doubtless prompt further debate over how long the 40-year-old will continue in the sport.“At the moment I’m only looking forward to the break,” he said at the Yas Marina circuit.“Just to disconnect, not ­speaking to anyone. No one will be able to get in touch with me this winter. I won’t have my phone with me and I’m looking forward to that. Completely unplug from the matrix.”Hamilton has said, however, that he supports hisFerrariteam’s decision to abandon development of this year’s car at an early stage in the season to put all their efforts into the new model for the new regulations of 2026.In his first season for the Scuderia that hadopened with so much optimism, the car was not up to scratch. Well off the pace of McLaren and behind the Red Bull, Ferrari were at best in a fight for third with Mercedes but were frequently found wanting even there.After qualifying at Abu Dhabi, his third consecutive exit in Q1, ­Hamilton was at the end of his tether. “I don’t have the words to describe the ­feeling that I have inside,” he said. “An unbearable amount of anger and rage. There is not really much I can say about it.”At the penultimate round of the season in Qatar the team principal, Fred Vasseur, said Ferrari had stopped developing the car in April, effectively ending any real chances of improvement for the rest of the year. Hamilton has failed to score a podium for the first time in his career this season but said he backed the team’s strategy.View image in fullscreenLewis Hamilton of Ferrari waves at the drivers’ parade ahead of the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty Images“I didn’t know at the end of the year we’d be where we are, no. We anticipated it but it felt worse, naturally. But I was a part of it, I was one pushing for it,” he said. “You can’t fall behind the others in terms of that development for the new car because it’s a steep learning curve for all of us. So I supported it 100%. I still do.”It has been a particularly difficult year for Hamilton, with the sole exception ofa win at the sprint race in China, which proved to be a false dawn, he has been comprehensively out-qualified in 19 of the 24 GPs and outraced by his teammate Charles Leclerc who has been with the team for seven years.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Donald Trump’s heroic victory over a field of one toclaim the inaugural Fifa peace prize, on-stage banter so dead it was already fossilized, Gianni Infantino doing crowd work, and Wayne Gretzkystrugglingthrough the pronunciation of “Macedonia” and “Curaçao” in the draw’s linguistic group of death: even with the benefit of a few days’ distance it’s impossible to overstate how impressively bad the draw for the 2026 World Cup, held last Friday at the Trump-purged Kennedy Center in Washington DC, was.“This is America, so we have to put on a show!” roared Fifa president Infantino,resemblinga Sphinx cat in a borrowed suit, at the beginning of the ceremony. And put on a show Fifa did – just not one that anyone wanted to watch, least of all a desperatelybored-lookingTrump, who sat through Andrea Bocelli’s Nessun Dorma with the granitic joylessness that has become his default expression ateach of the sporting eventshe’s ruined with his presence this year. Just let the man get back to the White House; he’s the president of the United States, for god’s sake,he has bathrooms to redesign.If this was a preview of next summer, the 23rd Mundial is on course for catastrophe. Danny Ramirez and Rio Ferdinand, in particular, seemed to generate some kind ofpurely negative chemistrythat could make a useful contribution to science. The US president may have been the headliner but Infantino stole the show: he led the American, Canadian, and Mexican segments of the audience in a series of chants that pointlessly chewed up 10 minutes on the clock, then got properly frothing – the real work of the Fifa president at an event such as this – as he welcomed the host nations’ leaders on stage to begin the draw. “Which team – will be drawn – by Mr Mark Carney?” he devilishly asked, with all the charisma of a middle-aged magician doing card tricks for small change at a weekend farmer’s market.Infantino genuinely seems to believe he’s some kind of comedian, but all the laughs he raised from the audience on Friday sounded coerced – like the laughter you might offer a wisecracking dentist as you’re in the treatment chair about to undergo an extraction. It takes a rare talent to make football fans nostalgic for Sepp Blatter, but Fifa’s presiding gollum is so insistently unpleasant, such a strange, damp little man, that he makes his famously venal predecessor look positively dapper and twinkle-eyed in comparison. The last World Cup draw held on US soil, in which Robin Williams monkeyed about on stagecalling Blatter “Mr Bladder”, was a minor comic miracle. Instead of Robin Williams, this launch got Robbie Williams, a devastating drop in off-field quality that also showed how much football’s ambitions in America have changed over the past 30 years. Rather than conquering America in a blaze of ambition and comedy, as the World Cup aimed to in 1994, this tournament is all about the consolidation of football as a tepid global lifestyle product, combining the worst of American sport’s commercialism, European football’sextractivism, and the moral turpitude of the Washington-to-Riyadh illiberal axis.“We love soccer! We rock!” the chorusechoedas Williams moped about the Kennedy Center stage on Friday, grayly delivering his rendition of the new official Fifa anthem, Desire. But is it soccer, or football? Well, unfortunately the World Cup draw had a lot to say about that too, in a series of “fun” segments debating what to call the sport in America (who cares?) that briefly threatened to kill anyone with an IQ over 50. Over on the set of host broadcaster Fox, new network talent Thierry Henry, holding on for dear life in the blast zone of Alexi Lalas’s jingoism, looked almost immediately regretful about his decision to accept the assignment as American TV’s token big tournament Euro. Giorgio Chiellini and others havetaken on this task in previous yearsand made it to the end looking like they’ve lived through centuries. Why, Titi, why?Predictably, all the emotional meat of Friday’s ceremony was in the theatre of a Fifa president groveling before America’s would-be king. Over the past few months, as Trump has overseen thedestruction of the East Wing, begun work on his cherished ballroom, and set about transforming the White House into a Live Laugh Love-themed suburban wedding reception center, it’s been reasonable to wonder where exactly they’ll put Infantino’s bedroom. A closet with a camp bed off the ballroom kitchen, perhaps? A tent illuminated by the light of Trump’s iPad on the newRose Garden patio? Now we have the answer: Infantino does not need a room in the presidential home because he’s taken up residence directly in Trump’s pocket. Through all the trials and setbacks of power, it must be reassuring for Trump to wake every morning and slip straight into his Gianni slacks, safe in the knowledge that the head of the world’s biggest sport – hairless dome crowning from the hip pocket – will gas him up no matter how many US citizens he sends to the gulag in El Salvador or blameless fishermenhe blasts out of the Caribbean. Would that we could all have a Gianni in our lives, though preferably not in our pants.Infantino introduced Trump on stage and presented him with three mementoes to mark the inaugural Fifa peace prize: a trophy, modeled seemingly on aUN sculpture in Genevabut echoing in its form the cover of aracist novel of the 1970sthat has inspired the modern American far right; a medal; and a signed certificate. (Presumably these will have to make way on the Oval Office mantelpiece next year for whatever Fifa gives Trump for winning the second annual Fifa peace prize.) Amid all this debasement the one redeeming note was that Infantino, rather humiliatingly, made Trump put the medal around his own neck, which the president dulydidwith all the grace of a tapeworm exiting the cloaca. “This is your prize, this is your peace prize!” Infantino yelped.View image in fullscreenThe World Cup was a drawn out affair.Photograph: Deccio Serrano/NurPhoto/ShutterstockThe whole thing was so overblown, so grotesquely obsequious, that even Trump seemed to find it a little offputting. Whether any of this – the embarrassment of Infantino’s lickspittle performance at the draw, the storm of mockery that greeted the decision to placate America’s toddler-in-chief with a made-up peace prize in the first place, the unpardonable tackiness of the entire spectacle – will stopFifafrom making 2026 all about Trump seems unlikely.On the one hand, Trumpian nativism is an inherently awkward fit for the World Cup, which even in the moral quicksands of Qatar still made a basic effort to advance its boilerplate clichés about openness to the world, inclusivity (“Today I feel, ah… gay”), and global friendship. On the other, next year’s tournament won’t be the first time that sport and authoritarian theatrics have come together on the global stage; we know from the 1936 Berlin Olympics that international sport and fascism mix easily, that they’re a match made in high-camp heaven. Fifa’s customary blather about equal rights and an end to racism has been swiftly forgotten amid the urgent task of getting on good terms with America’s reigning fascist. The organization that tied itself in ethical knots over recent years to keep politics out of sport – who remembers thedebacle over the OneLove armband? – seems determined to remake itself as Maga’s external affairs department. Perhaps we can all hope for a resurrection of the Fifa boss whodeclared, in Qatar, that Europeans should spend 3,000 years apologizing for the suffering they’ve inflicted on the world, but that seems like a message unlikely to endear him to the white supremacists and Great Replacement freaks who run America today.So enthusiastic is Infantino’s tonguing of the Trumpian boot that it’s fair to wonder how much worse things will be once the tournament proper begins, how much tighter Fifa’s embrace of Trumpworld will grow. Will we see walk-on roles before the opening match for Stephen Miller, JD Vance, Kristi Noem, and other lackeys of the Nerd Reich? Could the tournament create a special part for Pete Hegseth as a half-time on-field insult comedian? Might there be a special live stream of the Trump administration’s latest extrajudicial killing to spice things up during the heat breaks in Côte d’Ivoire v Curaçao? These sound insane but we’re already at the point where insanity can’t be ruled out. Nothing about Infantino’s management of the tricky relationship between his three co-hosts suggests a change in course from the cold-sweated sycophancy we’ve seen to date. We can and should expect the worst; Fifa is now the Federation Invested in Fascism in America.But Fifa also wants to squeeze the World Cup for everything it’s worth, and so far that’s translated into a determination to inject this whole soccer thing with a good old-fashioned dose of American garbage. Fifa trialed US-inspired game “improvements” – NBA-style players’ entrances and the like – during last summer’s Club World Cup and wants more next summer: recent reportssuggestthat these will include half-time interviews for head coaches and players and a lavish, Super Bowl-style half-time show during the final. No fans want this – least of all in the US itself, which Fifa continues to misunderstand as a land of footballing neanderthals in need of sugary treats to maintain engagement through the mind-bendingly complicated exercise that is watching a 90-minute sporting contest.It would be tempting to say that we’re witnessing the infantilization of world football, but the goal is open and the pun is right there: the hellish coupling of Magafifa is producing, before our eyes, the full-scale Infantinolization of the World Cup, in which unnecessary in-tournament gimmicks, scheduling “innovations”, and scammy ticketing procedures mix with crass commercialization, a cheap approximation of Hollywood glamor, and the craven coddling of the pea that passes for Trump’s heart. The tournament that is taking shapepromises to be hostileand patronizing to fans,unaffordable, excessively long and morally repugnant all at once. If that’s not worthy of some kind of award, then I guess I’ll have to find another use for these special Gianni-engraved commemorative cufflinks I just had made for Fifa’s numero uno. A World Cup that, off the field at least, everyone will hate: this is your prize, Mr Infantino!Explore more on these topicsWorld Cup 2026World CupGianni InfantinoFifaFootball politicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Victories are scarcely this comfortable, even if Ruben Amorim’s side needed to navigate the briefest of scares when Wolves equalised with half-time looming. United turned on the style after the break, the manager clenching his right fist when Mason Mount made it 3-1 with a smart volley, building on goals by Bryan Mbeumo and Bruno Fernandes, who also rounded off the scoring from the penalty spot.For Wolves, this was yet another demoralising defeat, a13th in 15 league matches. The last time they tasted victory, in April, Matheus Cunha, who enjoyed his return to Molineux in United’s all-black strip, opened the scoring. Nine fan groups totalling thousands of supporters protested against the Wolves owner, Fosun, by boycotting the first 15 minutes. Supporters voiced their anger at the players, too. “You’re not fit to wear the shirt,” they sang, and jeered Jørgen Strand Larsen when he was taken off. There were pantomime laughs when the fourth official indicated at least nine minutes of stoppage time.Wolves 1-4 Manchester United: Premier League – as it happenedRead moreThis season, primed to end in relegation, has been a painful slow puncture. Still, only another 23 league games to go. Next up, a trip to the leaders Arsenal on Saturday. How many points will Wolves take from the remaining 69 available? Will they beat Derby’s unwanted record-low tally of 11 in 2007-08? At this stage last season Southampton, who ended with 12, were on five. The mood music will not change anytime soon and it threatens to be a long six months for Rob Edwards, for whom this was a fourth straight defeat since taking charge. The stands were almost empty long before the final whistle, after which Cunha saluted those who stayed until the end. Wolves are a shell compared to the club that reached Europe under Nuno Espírito Santo.If ever a goal summed up Wolves’s season, it was Fernandes’s first here. André, facing his own goal, was dispossessed by Casemiro midway inside the Wolves half and the United midfielder located Cunha on the edge of the 18-yard box. United were two v one. Cunha teed up Fernandes, who, after losing his footing, recovered to shoot after keeping Emmanuel Agbadou at arm’s length, the Wolves resistance feeble. Fernandes’s shot was tame by his standards but beat Sam Johnstone in the Wolves goal. Yerson Mosquera was left in a tangle in the back of the net. Four minutes later, Cunha would have doubled their advantage but for Toti Gomes’s heroic goalline clearance.Even the most optimistic Wolves supporters are resigned to relegation. Anger has largely been superseded by apathy. Even the early jeers for Cunha were half hearted. “You sold the team, now sell the club,” was the now-familiar strain that rained down from the South Bank as those absent for the opening quarter of an hour went to their seats. Wolves’s supporters cycled through the chants against the club’s executive chair, Jeff Shi. “I understand the frustration,” Edwards said. “I won’t tell fans what to do. I’d love them to support the players but they have to see effort and commitment in return.”Few envisaged Wolves levelling on the verge of half-time, Jean-Ricner Bellegarde restoring parity. Or, indeed, Wolves being cheered off – and not sarcastically – as they headed down the tunnel at the break. Gomes crossed the ball from left to right and Ki-Jana Hoever sent it back where it came from. David Møller Wolfe blasted it into the box and Bellegarde, on the stretch, diverted the ball low into the bottom corner past Senne Lammens.View image in fullscreenMason Mount celebrates scoring against Wolves in their 4-1 win.Photograph: Darren Staples/AFP/Getty ImagesUnited reappeared intent on regaining the lead. “The manager had a few things to say,” Mount said diplomatically of Amorim’s half-time message. Cunha rolled Ladislav Krejci on the edge of the box but, looking for the far top corner, he spooned his shot over. Mbeumo saw a shot blocked, Agbadou thwarted Cunha.

Cunha sent a weighted pass through for Diogo Dalot, flying forward on the overlap, who squared the ball for Mbeumo to do the rest. It was a strike that killed any hopes of an unlikely comeback win. Mount, who scoredthe winner at Palaceon United’s previous away outing, made sure. Agbadou stopped a goalbound shot by Fernandes but then seemed to think it was job done. Fernandes reclaimed possession and scooped a pass into the box, where Mount, played onside by Agbadou, arrived unmarked to volley in.There was still time for more United cheer. First, the travelling supporters rejoiced at the 79th-minute arrival of Kobbie Mainoo, this his third appearance since October. Then, Mosquera was penalised for handball and Fernandes scored his second of the night from the spot, lashing his penalty low into the corner to lift United into sixth.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueWolverhampton WanderersManchester Unitedmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

In those leagues, the time between quarters is considered to be valuable for broadcasters, who sell advertising during the break in action.Zubiria indicated that referees may have some flexibility if there’s a stoppage shortly before the 22-minute mark for an injury.“This will be addressed on the spot with the referee,” Zubiria said.Fifa said the move is a “streamlined and simplified version” of an earlier practice of having breaks after 30 minutes over a certain temperature threshold, once set at 32C (89.6F) on the wet bulb global temperature system.The change comes after heat and humidity affected players during some games at this year’s Club World Cup in the US.At that tournament, Fifa reacted by lowering the threshold for cooling or water breaks and also placing more water and towels around the edge of the field.Heat has long been an issue at major soccer tournaments. Amid concerns ahead of the 2014 World Cup, a Brazilian court ordered FIFA to make its recommended breaks mandatory or face fines.A report published in September by Football for the Future, Common Goal and Jupiter Intelligence found 10 of the 16 venues for the World Cup, taking place in the U.S., Mexico and Canada, are at very high risk of extreme heat stress conditions.Explore more on these topicsWorld Cup 2026FifaWorld CupnewsShareReuse this content"

Josh Allen threw for three touchdowns and ran for one, and Christian Benford scored the go-ahead TD on a 63-yard interception return. Allen’s 40-yard TD rush broke his record for the longest by a Bills quarterback. Buffalo flipped the game with big plays on defense on a snowy afternoon. Benford and defensive end AJ Epenesa intercepted Joe Burrow on consecutive plays from scrimmage, leading to the Bills scoring three touchdowns in a span of 4:20 in the fourth quarter.Houston Texans 20-10 Kansas City ChiefsThe Kansas City Chiefs (6-7) are facing the very real possibility that they will miss the postseason for the first time since the 2014 season after losing to the Houston Texans (8-5) on Sunday Night Football. According to Next Gen Stats, the loss leaves the Chiefs with a 14% chance of reaching the playoffs. Patrick Mahomes was intercepted three times, although he was repeatedly let down by drops from his receivers and questionable calls from head coach Andy Reid. He also had to contend with a ferocious Texans defense, who deprived him of time in the pocket. The Chiefs defense was excellent in the second-half and the margin of defeat would have been larger without its efforts. The Texans, meanwhile, have won five in a row and move into the wildcard spot in the AFC.Pittsburgh Steelers 27–22 Baltimore RavensAaron Rodgers threw for 284 yards and a touchdown and even ran for TD in perhaps his best game with the Steelers, and Pittsburgh (7-6) took sole possession of first place in the AFC North, holding on for victory over the Ravens (6-7) when a Baltimore touchdown with 2:43 remaining was overturned by a replay review. Isaiah Likely secured a pass from Lamar Jackson with two hands in the end zone, and both his feet came down, but as he was about to complete another step with his right foot, Joey Porter Jr knocked the ball free. It was initially called a touchdown but then changed to incomplete. The Ravens eventually turned the ball over on downs.Chicago Bears 21–28 Green Bay PackersThe Green Bay Packers (9-3-1) have overtaken the Chicago Bears (9-4) for first place in the NFC North. Keisean Nixon intercepted Caleb Williams’ pass in the end zone with 22 seconds remaining to seal Green Bay’s win over Chicago. The Bears were facing fourth-and-one from Green Bay’s 14-yard line when Williams faked a handoff and rolled to his left. Tight end Cole Kmet had gotten behind Nixon in the end zone, but Nixon made a leaping catch of the underthrown pass. Josh Jacobs scored the tiebreaking touchdown on a two-yard run with 3:32 remaining as the Packers won their fourth straight and snapped Chicago’s five-game win streak.Indianapolis Colts 19–36 Jacksonville JaguarsTrevor Lawrence threw two touchdowns, and Travis Etienne rushed for two others to lead the Jacksonville Jaguars to a commanding victory in a crucial AFC South matchup as the Colts lost Daniel Jones toa reported torn achilles. Lawrence completed 17 of 30 passes for 244 yards. Brian Thomas Jr caught three passes for 87 yards, while Tim Patrick had 78 yards and a touchdown on five catches. Jacksonville (9-4) won their fourth straight game to move into sole possession of first place in the AFC South. Indianapolis (8-5) lost Jones in the first quarter, and ESPN later reported his season is over. The offense continued to move the ball at times with his backup, rookie Riley Leonard, but struggled to finish drives.Los Angeles Rams 45–17 Arizona CardinalsMatthew Stafford threw for 281 yards and three touchdowns, Puka Nacua and Blake Corum both scored twice and the Los Angeles Rams (10-3) rolled past the Arizona Cardinals. The Rams (10-3) scored 35 unanswered points to bounce back from last week’s turnover-filled loss to the Panthers. They won for the seventh time in eight games. Los Angeles are tied with the Seahawks atop the division, one game ahead of the 49ers. The reeling Cardinals (3-10) have lost five straight and 10 of their past 11 after starting the season with a 2-0 record.Denver Broncos 24–17 Las Vegas RaidersThe Denver Broncos have finally won a game where they didn’t fall behind. Bo Nix passed for 212 yards and rushed for a touchdown, and the Broncos beat the Las Vegas Raiders. The Raiders lost quarterback Geno Smith, who injured his right hand and shoulder in the third quarter and was replaced by Kenny Pickett. The Broncos improved to 11-2. They tied New England for the top seed in the AFC, and they ended theirNFLrecord of rallying for nine consecutive victories. The Raiders (2-11) have lost seven straight.New Orleans Saints 24-20 Tampa Bay BuccaneersThe New Orleans Saints upset the Tampa Bay Buccaneers to tighten the NFC South race. Rookie quarterback Tyler Shough ran for two touchdowns for lowly New Orleans, who improved to 3-10. The Saints were 8.5-point underdogs. They frustrated Baker Mayfield and the Buccaneers in a sloppy game mostly played through a storm. The four-time defending division champion Bucs fell to 7-6. They lost for the fourth time in five games and fell into a first-place tie with Carolina. The Bucs and Panthers face off twice in the final three games.Seattle Seahawks 37–9 Atlanta FalconsRashid Shaheed returned the second-half kickoff 100 yards for a touchdown, Seattle’s defense came up with three turnovers and the Seahawks beat the hapless Atlanta Falcons. Seattle improved to 10-3 and have their sights on a division title, maybe even a top seed in January. Sam Darnold threw for 249 yards and three touchdowns, including a pair of scores to Jaxon Smith-Njigba. The Seahawks broke away from a 6-6 tie at halftime with a 31-point beatdown of the Falcons over the final two quarters. The Falcons dropped to 4-9 and were officially eliminated from playoff contention.Tennessee Titans 31-29 Cleveland BrownsCam Ward threw two touchdown passes and Tony Pollard ran for two touchdowns as the Tennessee Titans ended a seven-game losing streak. The Titans kept Cleveland (3-10) out of the end zone in the second half until the Browns tallied two touchdowns in the waning minutes–- and followed both with failed two-point conversion attempts – to create drama between a pair of struggling teams. Shedeur Sanders threw seven yards to Harold Fannin II for a touchdown with 1:03 to play, but a two-point conversion pass failed. Pollard rushed for 161 yards on 25 carries as the Titans (2-11) won despite managing only 292 yards of total offense. Tennessee piled up their largest point total of the season. Ward was 14-for-28 for 117 yards and threw an early interception.Washington Commanders 0–31 Minnesota VikingsJJ McCarthy threw a career-high three touchdown passes in his first turnover-free game, returning from his latest injury absence in prime form for the Minnesota Vikings in a victory that sent the Washington Commanders to their eighth straight loss. McCarthy went 16 for 23 for 163 yards in his seventh NFL start. He sat out last week with a concussion while the Vikings were shut out for the first time in 18 years. McCarthy hit his tight ends for all three scores, two to Josh Oliver and one to TJ Hockenson. The Vikings are 5-8. The Commanders are 3-10.Miami Dolphins 34–10 New York JetsTua Tagovailoa remained unbeaten against the New York Jets, leading the Miami Dolphins (6-7) to victory over their AFC East rivals. With the win, Tagovailoa improved to 7-0 against the Jets (3-10) as a starter. The Dolphins have now won five of their last six games. De’Von Achane ran for 92 yards and a touchdown before leaving with a rib injury. Jaylen Wright stepped in with a career-high 107 yards. The Jets, now eliminated from playoff contention, saw rookie quarterback Brady Cook make his NFL debut after Tyrod Taylor left with a groin injury. Miami’s defense and special teams also played key roles in the win.Explore more on these topicsNFLBuffalo BillsPittsburgh SteelersUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

His relationship with Ruben Amorim had collapsed by the end of his five‑year stint at United and he was banished from the squad in pre‑season. Amorim felt he had failed to follow tactical instructions and, before the transfer was completed, said he sensed Garnacho wanted “a different thing with different leadership”.Mohamed Salah left out of Liverpool’s Champions League trip to InterRead moreSpeaking the evening before Chelsea’sChampions Leaguematch at Atalanta, Garnacho was asked whether he harboured any regrets at all about the way things had ended. “No,” was the extent of his response, a word subsequently repeated when questioned on whether he felt any sadness.Garnacho was keener to ­elaborate on his bond with Enzo Maresca, who has worked intensively on the Argentinian’s positioning off the ball. “Sometimes in life you have to change things to take a step ­forward or improve as a player,” he said. “I think it was the right moment and the right club, so it was an easy decision. I came here to play my football and show people the player I am.“The most important thing is confidence. [Maresca] speaks with me every week and I think we are going to get better, me as a player and the team together, with time. We started the season three months ago so it’s building confidence between the manager and the player.”Chelsea will hope Garnacho, who scored in their previous Champions Leagueaway assignment at Qarabag, is at his scintillating best against an Atalanta side that are below them only on goal difference in the sprawling league phase table. Maresca’s team sit ­seventh and the jeopardy in this fixture, such as it is, lies in trying to avoid a scramble out of the ­playoff spots after Christmas. It is their third consecutive match on the road after thedefeat by Leedsanddraw at Bournemouth.Maresca spoke highly of Atalanta’s work as a reference point for Italian football under their former manager Gian Piero Gasperini. They are now led by Raffaele Palladino, a Gasperini protege with whom Maresca crossed paths briefly as a player at Juventus, and he warned that his players would not lack company in the attractively renovated New Balance Arena.“Now many teams [in Italy] try to do something similar to what ­Atalanta has done in the last years with Gasperini,” Maresca said. “So you can see most of the teams played five at the back, most of the teams tried to play man-to-man everywhere. If you go to the toilet, they follow you everywhere.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Nor will it include Liam Delap, whose injury-plagued season worsened when he picked up a shoulder injury at Bournemouth. Maresca said Delap had not sustained a fracture but did not give a timeframe for his comeback.Six years ago the outcast Raheem Sterling scored an 11-minute hat-trick against Atalanta for Manchester City. Maresca was asked whether Sterling, who has not played for Chelsea since May 2024, has any route back into his thoughts. “In terms of Raheem it’s the same thing I said about Axel [Disasi], they are Chelsea players,” he said. “Now also we are in December, January is coming so anything can happen, we’ll see.”Explore more on these topicsChelseaAtalantaChampions LeaguenewsShareReuse this content"

The details were set out in a public document at the high court in London.A source close to Bloom has said he intends to file a defence to the high court claim in due course.He did not respond to questions from the Guardian about the claim. On Friday,the Guardian published a second storythat focused on allegations Bloom could be an anonymous gambler behind $70m (£52m) in winnings – which allegedly included bets on his football teams.Bloom declined to comment about this specific claim, but through a source made clear he denied betting on his own teams or competitions that involve them, describing any such allegations as “entirely false”. He has since issued a public statement saying he had not bet on Brighton or any competition they are involved in since becoming its owner.Anna Sabine, the Liberal Democrat culture spokesperson, said the ban “completely flies in the face” of press freedom.“It is totally unacceptable that Brighton & Hove Albion FC ban specific outlets for simply reporting on allegations that are in the public interest,” she said. “This sets a dangerous precedent and the club should apologise and rethink this misguided decision.”Owen Meredith, the chief executive of the News Media Association, said the ban represented “a deeply troubling attack on press freedom”.“Football clubs and their owners occupy a prominent place in public life, and with that profile comes responsibility – including the responsibility to respect independent journalism,” he said.“Journalism exists to ask difficult questions on behalf of the public, including sports fans, and shutting reporters out sets a dangerous precedent for the game and for democratic accountability. If football clubs pick and choose who gets to scrutinise them, we are not in a world of sport, but censorship.”The News Media Coalition, which champions media reporting at organised news events including football matches, urged Brighton to swiftly reconsider. “Banning sports and news reporters, photographers and video journalists from attending football matches serves nobody,” said Andrew Moger, its chief executive.A Brighton spokesperson said: “It is not a decision we took lightly, and gave the Guardian more than 24 hours to remove or add some balance to the offending story. Instead, the Guardian doubled down.“We completely refute the claim we are restricting press freedom by not permitting access to our stadium press facilities or training ground. The Guardian will continue to report as it wishes.“We don’t however have to entertain its staff with media passes and hospitality at our stadium or press conferences while it continues to publish articles that are misleading and contain inaccuracies regarding our club’s owner.”Explore more on these topicsBrighton & Hove AlbionThe GuardianNational newspapersPress freedomnewsShareReuse this content"

Like something from a war film or a western, a heist movie or the truest romance, Williot Swedberg just walked calmly through the chaos and the noise, nothing the defeated could do now. Some had fallen, others just froze: all of them left behind with only the realisation, watching in slow motion as he went, their fate sealed and his victory secured, the story finished even before he had. Suitably cinematic and so cool.When did you last see someone literally walk the ball in? Here, of all places, it happened, and it was the perfect picture. An hour had gone when Swedberg, unseen, appeared like a shadow, providing a flick so subtle it wasn’t seen at first either and so soft it was like he was wearing slippers. That had deservedly delivered the opening goal, Celta leading 1-0. Now, into added time 19 years since they last won a league game here and having resisted the bugle call, the Bernabéu doing its Bernabéu thing, it was time to add the coup de grace.Hamburg bloody Werder Bremen’s nose with winner in breathless Nordderby | Andy BrassellRead moreMadrid had just lost their heads and been shown five cards in 38 seconds, Álvaro Carreras’s sending off leaving them with nine men, but they hadn’t yet lost the game. The clock showed 92.02, time enough for a final twist, another epic ending from the team and the place that sometimes feels like it can’t be bothered with any other kind, and the home goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois had a free-kick. Sending everyone forward, this was an opportunity, perhaps the last one, to launch the ball into the Celta area; instead, after a punt forward as aimless as their performance and so many others before, it ended up back in his.Deep in the left corner, Sergio Carreira played the ball inside, cutting through the white shirts again, and Celta were running into the space. Madrid, open again, desperately chased, or some of them did. Iago Aspas played it to Swedberg, who nudged on Javi Rueda, still flying and leaving Fede Valverde on the floor. Reaching the edge of the area, Rueda cut away from Vinícius Júnior and gave it to Aspas, still better than anyone else at 38. Faced by three men in a line and another, Antonio Rüdiger, five metres behind it, Aspas looked one way and passed the other, slipping a lovely first-time ball beyond Bellingham.And then the scene slows, defeat dawning on them. So this is how it ends. Six men in the frame, one strolling through it. Valverde has got up again, but there’s no way back so he stops. They all do. Bellingham, bamboozled, stands arms out. Wait, what? Vinícius, Tchouaméni: nope. And Rüdiger: beaten, bent double, hands on his knees, he peers forward as if wanting a closer look at their demise. Only Courtois can stop this now, but time has slowed and he hasn’t, sliding by instead. Swedberg, taken out by Madrid goalkeeper Andriy Lunin and not given a penalty last season, steps past him and walks into the net. Revenge is cold, the kick that kills them not a kick at all. Behind the goal, just visible, someone’s head is in their hands.View image in fullscreenÁlvaro Carreras is shown a red card by referee Alejandro Quintero, taking Real Madrid down to nine men.Photograph: Ángel Martínez/Getty ImagesAll that’s lacking is Swedberg getting on his knees and heading it in, some sort of sunset to disappear off into. 2-0. Focus fades, roll the credits.Ah, yeah.That. “Dia de la Bestia,” AS calls it after Álex de la Iglesia’s gloriously silly 1995 film about a Basque priest trying to prevent the birth of the antichrist, referee Alejandro Quintero standing at the centre of the cover photo because, well, that’s where they always stand. The Day of the Beast is a farce and El Mundo Deportivo are enjoying it: “Real disaster: a nightmare before Christmas,” the Catalan daily cheers. “Panic breaks out,” AS write, while El Mundo’s headline sums it up in a single word: “Desperate.” El Pais calls Madrid “vulgar,” saying they have “lost it”. They certainly had. Carreras had got two cards in four seconds: first for a gesture, then for telling the referee “you’re so bad”. Nine seconds later, Rodrygo, squaring up to the referee, gets a yellow which could have been red. Valverde does too. There was a red for someone on the bench who turns out to be Endrick, a handy reminder that he’s there. Five cards in 36 seconds are followed by more confrontations at the final whistle and down in the tunnel there is more. Dani Carvajal, who hasn’t played, is having a go at Quintero – “and then you go and cry in press conferences,” he says.Xabi Alonso says he didn’t like the officiating. He also explains that an early injury to Éder Militão hurt them, which is just about all he manages to say and which is no explanation at all not really, a herring of deep red. Fran García’s sending-off is as justified as it is stupid, Alonso’s live reaction on the touchline summing it up better than anything he can say in the press room afterwards: “Fran! For fuck’s sack Fran!” By then, Madrid were already a goal down, and they actually got better with 10 men. For an hour, they had done almost nothing. If Carreras’s yellow was swift, the goal that followed it was even swifter, Swedberg walking it in 22 seconds after the restart.View image in fullscreenReal Madrid’s players visibly sagged as the late second goal unfolded.Photograph: Manu Fernández/APSomething in that final scene summed Madrid up on Sunday, a portrait of powerlessness: a team picked apart, a manager whose position is ever more precarious.Against Athletic last Wednesday, Alonso had found accommodation with players, a compromise that calmed the crisis, or at least covered some cracks, before heading home at last. Four days later they returned to the Bernabéu for the first time in a month and lost.Winners in the clasicoin late October, at the end of their last home game, a4-0 over Valenciaon 1 November, Madrid had been eight points clear of Barça. Unable to win at Rayo, Elche and Girona, they find themselves four points behind, a 12-point swing in 36 days. “Madrid are lost,” Marca claimed. Madrid have “no football, no ideas and not much attitude”, El Mundo said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It wasn’t just the bad guys in that final scene, it was the good guys too. Madrid had a handful of chances: Kylian Mbappé and Vinícius escaped beyond Celta once each, while Gonzalo García headed an opportunity just wide. But, it often felt, their opportunities happened; Celta’s were made, a clarity and identity in everything they did.A young, superbly organised side, determined to play, not park the bus, they were superb. “A magisterial lesson,” Faro de Vigo called it, rightly. History made, down in the dressing room, La Morocha blasted out and pizza was thrown in the air.At the heart of it, Borja Iglesias was immense, a performance bordering on perfection, but it had been all of them, the control startlingly complete, intelligence and structure in every decision. It is hard to remember the last time a team pulled another about the pitch the way Claudio Giráldez’s side did on Sunday, as iftheywere deciding Madrid’s movements too. The Bernabéu had whistled as the visitors played with them, frustration growing with every late arrival, white shirts getting there to find the ball had gone, if they got there at all. Repeatedly, Celta drew them in and stepped beyond, again and again until the very end, any hope of some epic finale gently, smoothly taken from them, Real Madrid’s players unable to do anything now but watch as Swedberg walked past unmoved by the madness, all else fading around him as he crossed the line.PosTeamPGDPts1Barcelona1627402Real Madrid1617363Villarreal1518354Atletico Madrid1613315Espanyol153276Real Betis156247Athletic Bilbao16-5238Getafe15-4209Elche1511910Celta Vigo15-11911Alaves15-21812Rayo Vallecano15-31713Sevilla15-41714Real Sociedad15-31615Valencia15-91516Mallorca15-71417Osasuna14-61218Girona15-161219Oviedo15-151020Levante14-109Explore more on these topicsReal MadridCelta VigoLa LigaEuropean club footballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The Wales head coach reacted to those premature celebrations by saying after the game: “I hope I see you at the World Cup.”World Cup playoff draw: Wales face Bosnia, Northern Ireland head to Italy, Ireland go to PragueRead moreMarsch stoked the fires at the next international break in October by accusing Bellamy of “ridiculousness”, claiming his comments were a distraction from the factWaleshad lost to Canada.The two nations were then paired together in Friday’s World Cup draw, should Wales progress through the playoffs in March, and would face each other in the Group B opener in Toronto on 12 June 2026.“We’ve got to get there first but, if that is the case, then we’ll definitely have a nice conversation before that,” Bellamy said reflecting on a potential reunion with Marsch and a World Cup group that also includes Switzerland and Qatar. “I’ve got nothing against that guy, by the way, I think he’s got something against the world. There’s a part of me that really likes him from afar without really knowing him.“But some of the things he says, you see his interviews before the other games after playing us … I think I find him very interesting.”Asked about the nature of Canada’s celebrations in Swansea, Bellamy said: “All those wind me up, I’ve got to be honest, they all do. Be respectful. It’s not about the opposition, that’s part of the game I see through. It’s maybe more for TikTok or Instagram. I’m not a dinosaur, trust me. I’m not like old-fashioned, but there’s a level of respect.”Wales host Bosnia and Herzegovinain their playoff semi-final in Cardiff on 26 March.

After they overcame a stubborn Leicester City side3-0 on Sundayto claim a ninth straight win, it would appear the answer to that question is “significantly” compared to recent seasons, as they demonstrated a unity and a composure that has perhaps evaded many title hopefuls of old. December last year brought moments when Manchester City’s campaign began to unravel, through a combination of injuries and surprise defeats. On Sunday they looked like potential champions in the sense that they found a way to win what could very easily have become a frustrating game, against a back five in a low block. Andrée Jeglertz pointed to this professionalism and calmness at full time: “I’m very proud and pleased with the patience the players are showing, the trust, the belief. They are not starting to yell at each other, they just keep believing in each other and believing in what we are doing.”Tom GarryReborn and ruthless: can Manchester City realise their WSL title dream?Read moreChelsea’s historic unbeaten run endedIt had to happen at some point, didn’t it? But few would have anticipated that Everton would be the team to end Chelsea’s historic 34-game unbeaten WSL run. The reigning champions had not lost a league fixture in 585 days, dating back to May 2024 when they suffered a defeat to Liverpool. Despite having 79% of the possession against Everton and 30 shots on goal, Chelsea could not make the most of their chances and ultimately paid the price, leaving them six points behind league leaders Manchester City. Sonia Bompastor, for whom this was a first taste of defeat in the WSL, said: “It’s a really frustrating result. It’s tough, but I think if we analyse the performance and look at the statistics, I don’t think the players could have done a lot more. Maybe we could have been more clinical. We created enough shots, crosses, and we hit the woodwork three times. It’s just one of these games where the ball didn’t want to go in.”Emillia HawkinsSpurs eye Champions League spot under HoMartin Ho’s shake-up of Tottenham is starting to show results. A frantic final 10 minutes against Aston Villa was blockbuster viewing as Bethany England and Olivia Holdt scored to seal a stunning 2-1 comeback. Already they are just one point short of their total points haul (20) last season. They’re also a point away from a Champions League spot. The Spurs squad has not changed hugely, with a handful of players exiting in the summer and two signings. But what seems to have changed is their mentality. Jessica Naz being carried off with an injury in the second half felt like a make-or-break situation – they chose to make the best of it. “It’s just a never-say-never attitude,” said England, “It was important to make sure we weren’t sulking or accepting a defeat to a team we know we can beat.”Renuka OdedraView image in fullscreenOlivia Holdt celebrates after scoring Tottenham’s winner against Aston Villa.Photograph: Jess Hornby/WSL/Getty ImagesFamiliar failings for West Ham before six-pointerOn the face of it maybe West Ham shouldn’t be too disappointed with the 2-1 defeat at Manchester United on Sunday. After all United had won each of their five home games against the Hammers in the WSL by an aggregate score of 17-0. As it happened it was a familiar theme that undid the visitors with Dominique Janssen’s fantastic free-kick securing the three points for Marc Skinner’s side. West Ham have struggled with set-pieces this season and have now conceded from seven of them in their 10 league games – the most in the top flight. The West Ham manager, Rehanne Skinner, was not too downbeat after the defeat. “The way we showed ourselves today shows the improvements we have made,” she told the BBC. “The fact that we are so disappointed not to have come away with anything shows the attitude and belief among the players.” Next, though, comes a game against Liverpool, the only side behind the Hammers in the WSL table.Réshma Raoskip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Yet, despite two draws and no wins from nine games, the performances of Gareth Taylor’s side, particularly inSaturday’s 2-1 loss to Arsenaland their back-to-back points earned against Brighton and Chelsea in the two preceding fixtures, have been promising. They need signings, though and “lots” of them, according to Taylor. The manager conceded coming into a club with so little resources, after working at Manchester City, was “really tough”. “I like a challenge. This is a real challenge,” he said. “The girls are top class, they really are. They’re really humble. They want to be coached. You can see that they want to get better and improve. We want this thing to work. I am a coach that never usually compromises on my game style or method or philosophy but of course I need players that can execute that as well. So, at the moment, I am making compromises. I’ve been honest and open about that and I’d be daft not to be.” Now, the board needs to cough up.Suzanne WrackNnadozie proves one of the signings of the seasonChiamaka Nnadozie is looking like one of the signings of the season and impressed once more in Brighton’s narrow 1-0 win over London City Lionesses. Before Sunday’s game, the Nigerian goalkeeper had made the joint highest number of stops in the league (42) alongside Leicester City’s Janina Leitzig and had a save percentage (80.8%) that is second only to Hannah Hampton’s. The 25-year-old does live by the “no risk, no reward” mantra but, despite the odd scare, her shot-stopping is second to none. She made five saves to deny the hosts at Bromley, proving a crucial cog in a Brighton defence that came under pressure but never broke. The visitors were also helped by London City’s wastefulness in front of goal. The Seagulls’ out-of-possession work is the part of their game that has developed the most in 2025 and they boast the fourth-joint meanest defence in the league. The consistency of the centre-back partnership between Caitlin Hayes and Moeka Minami has been key to this.Sophie DowneyExplore more on these topicsWomen's Super LeagueWomen's footballManchester City WomenLiverpool FC WomenArsenal WomenChelsea WomenTottenham Hotspur WomenfeaturesShareReuse this content"

His title rival Max Verstappen won the race but fell short of Norris by two points. The fight remained tight to the decisive last round with Norris’s McLaren teammate, Oscar Piastri, who had led the championship for a large part of the season, also in the mix for the final race but who ultimately finished third.Lando Norris claims he was often unmatchable on way to F1 title gloryRead more“It was like a movie,” the 26‑year‑old said. “As much as I was trying to avoid every bump possible I was also remembering all of those moments from the very beginning, driving a go-kart for the first time ever, my first time on the track in a go-kart, the races I had, the karting world championship I won in 2014 and many different memories.“I was watching me. I was living it but I was also watching me drive around from a bird’s-eye view and this was all within the space of a couple of minutes, through to the last seven years ofMcLarenand the good and bad moments of the season.”Norris also revealed he had partied until 6am with his friends at the W hotel that overlooks the Yas Marina circuit and ended the night at a McDonald’s. “I had a Sausage McMuffin. Was it the breakfast of champions? Certainly not, I regretted it straightaway.”The Briton had to hold his nerve to see out a tense fight in Abu Dhabi and pull off some bold overtakes to ensure he claimed the third place he needed but said that at the close he was unsure how he would feel when he finally took the championship he had dreamed of winning since he was a child.“I had no idea what to expect,” he said. “With three laps to go I was like: ‘I am getting pretty close and I’m not feeling anything yet.’ I was like: ‘Is this going to mean a lot to me?’“Then the next lap I started having these cool flashbacks. It was like a montage of my life and going under the bridge for the final time and imagining my mum in the garage and that made me emotional.“The best memory was when I came round the final corner and this is now from my view from my eyes inside my visor and seeing the ­chequered flag and that moment of lifting off and being able to cry. I want to savour that moment because that was the ‘it’ moment.”View image in fullscreenLando Norris said he was unsure how much the moment would mean to him as he neared clinching the F1 world title.Photograph: Nicolas Economou/NurPhoto/ShutterstockAs the 11th British driver to win the world championship he stands in illustrious company but was insistent the newfound fame, and all that is associated with it, would not change him. “From the exterior it will change my life but it won’t change me and how I live it. I really hope it doesn’t anyway. I don’t want to be that kind of person,” he said.Norris was involved in a battle with Verstappen for the title last season, albeit coming from well behind the Dutchman and the McLaren team principal, Andrea Stella, believed this was one of the two key areas he had identified that had enabled Norris to close out his first title.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSport in FocusFree weekly newsletterOur picture editors select their favourite sporting images from the past week, from the spectacular to the powerful, and with a little bit of fun thrown inEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

[But] I think Lando elevated his sense of status, like: ‘I can compete with Max.’”Norris also struggled with the car for the opening half of this season, not having the feel for the front grip he prefers and it particularly cost him in qualifying. It was a period when Piastri took the lead of the championship with a series of enormously assured drives.The team were ultimately able to bring developments to the car around the front suspension such that Norris felt much more comfortable and Stella maintained that the way he handled the difficult period was key.“This season there was another important turning point in my view, which is the way Lando responded to the difficulties we had at the start of the season,” he said. “It was the start of a process which was structured, holistic, it involved personal development, professional driving, racecraft.“It makes me particularly glad that Lando could capitalise on this, because this has been something that I’ve not necessarily seen many times before in terms of the amount of work, the people involved, and the rate of development.”Explore more on these topicsLando NorrisFormula One 2025McLarenFormula OneMotor sportnewsShareReuse this content"

At least16 datacenter projects, worth a combined $64bn, have been blocked or delayed due to local opposition to rising electricity costs. The facilities’ need for huge amounts of water to cool down equipment has also proved controversial,particularly in drier areas where supplies are scarce.These seemingly parochial concerns have now multiplied to become a potent political force, helping propel Democrats to a series of emphatic recent electoral successes in governor elections inVirginiaandNew Jerseyas well as a stunningupset winin a special public service commission poll in Georgia, with candidatescampaigningon lowering power bill costs andcurbing datacenters.This threatens to be a major headache for Donald Trump, who has aggressively pushed thegrowth of AIbut also called himself the “affordability president” and vowed to cut energy costs in half in his first year.However, household electricity prices have increased by13%so far under Trump and the president recently lashed out in the wake of the election losses, calling affordability a “fake narrative” and a “con job” created by Democrats. “They just say the word,” Trump said last week. “It doesn’t mean anything to anybody. They just say it – affordability.”Yet about 80 million Americans are currentlystrugglingto pay their bills for electricityand gas, with many voters regardless of political party blaming datacenters for this, according to Charles Hua, founder and executive director of PowerLines, a non-partisan organization that aims to reduce power bills.“We saw rising utility bills become a core concern in the New Jersey, Georgia and Virginia elections, which shows us there is a new politics in America – we are entering a new era that is all about electricity prices,” Hua said.“Nobody in America wants to pay more for electricity and we saw in Georgia a meaningful chunk of conservative voters vote against the Republican incumbents, which was staggering.”Hua said the causes of the electricity cost rises were nuanced, with ageing transmission lines and damage caused by extreme weather also adding to utilities’ costs on top of the surging demand for power.But it is the growth of datacenters to service AI – with electricity consumption set to nearlytripleover the next decade, equivalent to powering 190m new homes – that is the focus ofirefor voters as well as an unlikely sweep of politicians ranging fromBernie Sanderson the left toMarjorie Taylor Greeneon the far right.More broadly, almost half of Americanssaythe cost of living in the US, including power, food and other essentials, is the worst they can ever remember it being.This focus on affordabilityhas provided a new line of attackfor an environmental movement that has struggled to counter Trump’sonslaughtupon rules that reduce air and water pollution. The president has called the climate crisis a “hoax” and clean energy a “scam” and hasslashed support forand evenblockednew wind and solar projects, even though renewables are often thecheapestand fastest options for new power generation.At the current rate of growth, datacenterscould add up to44m tons of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere by 2030, equivalent to putting an extra 10m cars on to the road and exacerbating a climate crisis that is already spurring extremeweatherdisastersand ripping apart the fabricof the American insurance market.But it is the impact upon power bills, rather than the climate crisis, that is causing anguish for most voters, acknowledged Emily Wurth, managing director of organizing at Food & Water Watch, the group behind the letter to lawmakers.“I’ve been amazed by the groundswell of grassroots, bipartisan opposition to this, in all types of communities across the US,” she said. “Everyone is affected by this, the opposition has been across the political spectrum. A lot of people don’t see the benefits coming from AI and feel they will be paying for it with their energy bills and water.“It’s an important talking point,” Wurth said of the affordability concerns. “We’ve seen outrageous utility price rises across the country and we are going to lean into this. Prices are going up across the board and this is something Americans really do care about.”Explore more on these topicsUS newsEnergyArtificial intelligence (AI)newsShareReuse this content"

And he said: ‘Every time you refresh, it’s adding 500 followers.’ So I had to try to get to the top of the hill with the phone to check for myself.”A personal trainer from Berkshire who began posting her fitness classes online at the start of lockdown in 2020, Idiens, 53, had already built a respectable following.But after one video offering guidance on getting toned summer arms was picked up by a US fitness account, that number rocketed to 50,000 – and beyond. “I post it every year now as a bit of a tribute,” she jokes. “It was that reel that launched me into a whole new market.”Today, as@carolinescircuits, she has 2.3 million followers on Instagram, more than 70,000 onTiktokand 50,000 onYouTube, and a book,Fit at 50, that was a recent Sunday Times bestseller – making her a key influencer in an increasingly important demographic for social media platforms: those in midlife and older.If you want to grow your reach on social media, figures suggested this week, you could do worse than target the over-55s.Research from media analysts Ampere found it was people in the 55 to 64 age bracket who were delivering the highest growth inYouTubetraffic, up 20% since 2020 in the US and 14% in the UK. Tiktok, too, has had a 16% rise in British users in this age bracket in the past year.View image in fullscreenValerie Mackay has gained 312,000 followers onTiktokand almost 1 million onInstagramas @embracingfifty.“We’ve been seeing this trend over the last few years where older audiences who have traditionally [focused on] linear and broadcast TV have been digitising,” says Minal Modha, the head of Ampere’s consumer research division.“And by getting access to things like smartphones and smart TVs in particular, it’s opening up a whole new world for them.” More than half of US adults in the age bracket now watch influencer videos weekly.Some of them will be tuning in to Valerie Mackay from Inverness, who as @embracingfifty has gained 312,000 followers onTiktokand almost 1 million onInstagramsince she started her warmly chatty account eight years ago.“In hindsight, I wouldn’t have picked that name ’cause I’m now 62 and stuck with it. But the point of the name was I was embracing life over 50. I had two children, they had both left home and I was enjoying life with myself and my husband, it was like freedom.”She founded her account after overhearing a woman asking what was the point of makeup and style after a certain age. “I just thought, well, what’s the point in life? Just dress and be who you want to be.”Mackay says she tries not to think about the huge numbers watching her from around the world – many of whom share an interest in the Scottish weather.“I get asked a lot: ‘I’m coming to Scotland, what do I wear?’ Which it’s difficult for me to answer because I might be flitting about in a trench coat and they might need big coats.”Mark Lidster is a 62-year-old from north London who posts videos as FitnessGeezer onYouTubeand Instagram, attracting up to 1m views. “There are a lot of guys out there getting to 40, through to 70, 80 – who relate and take inspiration from what I’m doing,” he says.View image in fullscreenMark Lidster, AKA FitnessGeezer, says he tries to create a community feel.Photograph: Mark LidsterLike Mackay, Lidster says actively engaging with his audience is crucial. As well as becoming more savvy with tech, he says, “people of that age are feeling more disconnected from society, and getting lonelier.Social mediais another way of feeling part of something – I try to create that community feel.”The crucial thing with 50-somethings and older is “to keep it genuine”, says Idiens, who is 53.“The biggest thing about social media in this age bracket is trust,” she says.“It has to be genuine – we are a little bit older and wiser, and what the audience are really looking for are people that they can trust with advice. For the midlife demographic, they also really love that sense of community.“Even with an audience of 2 million, I still think, when I’m putting up a post, that it’s going to my friends and family group. And the feedback I get is that [my followers] still feel like I’m a PT [personal trainer] in their sitting room – which, for me, is everything. That’s what I want.”Explore more on these topicsYouTubeSocial mediaDigital mediaInternetFitnessMidlakeMiddle agefeaturesShareReuse this content"

However, the study found that social media use over a period of time was associated with an increase in inattention symptoms in children. ADHD is aneurodevelopmental disorderwith symptoms including impulsiveness, forgetting everyday tasks and difficulty focusing.“We identified an association between social media use and increased inattention symptoms, interpreted here as a likely causal effect,” said the study. “Although the effect size is small at individual level, it could have significant consequences if behaviour changes across population level. These findings suggest that social media use may contribute to rising incidence of ADHD diagnoses.”Torkel Klingberg, a professor of cognitive neuroscience at the Karolinska Institute, said: “Our study suggests that it is specifically social media that affects children’s ability to concentrate.“Social media entails constant distractions in the form of messages and notifications, and the mere thought of whether a message has arrived can act as a mental distraction. This affects the ability to stay focused and could explain the association.”The study found the ADHD link was not affected by socioeconomic background or a genetic predisposition towards the condition. Klingberg added that increased use of social media may explain part of the increase in ADHD diagnoses. Its prevalence among children has risen from 9.5% in 2003-07 to 11.3% in 2020-22, according to the US national survey of children’s health.The researchers stressed the results did not imply all children who used social media developed concentration problems. But they pointed to increased use of social media by children as they got older and to children using social media well before they turned 13, the minimum age for apps such as TikTok and Instagram.The report said: “This early and increasing social media use underscores the need for stricter age verification and clearer guidelines for tech companies.”The study found a steady increase in social media use from about 30 minutes a day at age nine to two and a half hours a day by age 13. The children were enrolled for the study at the ages of nine and 10 between 2016 and 2018. The study will be published in the Pediatrics Open Science journal.“We hope that our findings will help parents and policymakers make well-informed decisions on healthy digital consumption that support children’s cognitive development,” said Samson Nivins, one of the study’s authors and a postdoctoral researcher at the Karolinska Institute.Explore more on these topicsInternet safetySocial mediaAttention deficit hyperactivity disorderHealthChildrenDigital mediaSocial networkingnewsShareReuse this content"

It is calling on Keir Starmer to show independence from Donald Trump’s White House, which opposes the regulation of AI. One of the “godfathers” of the technology, Yoshua Bengio,recently said it was less regulated than a sandwich.The campaigners include the Labour peer and former defence secretary Des Browne, who said superintelligent AI “would be the most perilous technological development since we gained the ability to wage nuclear war”. He said only international cooperation “can prevent a reckless race for advantage that could imperil us all”.The Conservative peer and former environment minister Zac Goldsmith said that “even while very significant and senior figures in AI are blowing the whistle, governments are miles behind the AI companies and are leaving them to pursue its development with virtually no regulation”.Britain hosted an AI safety summit at Bletchley Park in 2023, which concluded there was “potential for serious, even catastrophic, harm, either deliberate or unintentional” from the most advanced AI systems. It set up the AI Safety Institute, now called the AI Security Institute, which has become an internationally respected body. Less emphasis, however, has been placed on the summit’s call to address risks through international cooperation.Goldsmith said the UK should “resume its global leadership on AI security by championing an international agreement to prohibit the development of superintelligence until we know what we are dealing with and how to contain it”.The calls for state intervention in the AI race come after one of Silicon Valley’s leading AI scientists told the Guardian humanity would have to decide by 2030 whether to take the “ultimate risk” of letting AI systems train themselves to become more powerful. Jared Kaplan, the co-founder and chief scientist at frontier AI company Anthropic, said: “We don’t really want it to be a Sputnik-like situation where the government suddenly wakes up and is like: Oh, wow, AI is a big deal.”‘The biggest decision yet’: Jared Kaplan on allowing AI to train itselfRead moreLabour’s programme set out in July 2024 said it would legislate “to place requirements on those working to develop the most powerful artificial intelligence models”. But no bill has been published and the government has faced White House pressure not to inhibit commercial AI development, mostly pioneered by US firms.A spokesperson for the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology said: “AI is already regulated in the UK, with a range of existing rules already in place. We have been clear on the need to ensure the UK and its laws are ready for the challenges and opportunities AI will bring and that position has not changed.”The bishop of Oxford, Steven Croft, who is backing the Control AI campaign, called for an independent AI watchdog to scrutinise public sector use and for AI companies to be required to meet minimum testing standards before releasing new models.“There are all kinds of risks and the government doesn’t seem to have adopted a precautionary principle,” he said. “At the moment there are significant risks: the mental health of children and adults, the environmental costs and other big risks in terms of the alignment of generalised AI and [the question of] what is good for humanity. The government seems to be moving away from regulation.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He said rules should be global and would create tripwires so if AI models reached a certain power their makers would have to show they had been tested, designed with off switches and were capable of being retrained.“International frontier AI safety has not gone on in leaps and bounds as we had hoped,” he said. He cited recent cases of chatbots being involved in encouraging suicides, people using them as therapists and believing they are gods. “The risks, now, are very serious and we need to be constantly on our guard,” he said.The chief executive of Control AI, Andrea Miotti, criticised the current “timid approach” and said: “There has been a lot of lobbying from the UK and US. AI companies are lobbying governments in the UK and US to stall regulation arguing it is premature and would crush innovation. Some of these are the same companies who say AIs could destroy humanity.”He said the speed with which AI technology was advancing meant mandatory standards could be needed in the next one or two years.“It’s quite urgent,” he said.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)ComputingRegulatorsnewsShareReuse this content"

All are heavily invested in AI.Never before has so much of the economy been dependent on one technology.

Millions of people have fond memories of playing the original Red and Blue games, or trading cards in the playground for that elusive shiny Charizard (if your school didn’t ban them). The franchise has only grown since then – but, where the trading cards are concerned, things have taken an unexpected and unfortunate turn. It’s now almost impossible to get your hands on newly released cards thanks to an insane rise in reselling and scalping over the past year.Selling on your old cards to collectors has always been part of the hobby, and like baseball cards or Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon cards can sometimes go for thousands of pounds. However, the resale market for Pokémon has climbed so high that even new cards are valued at hundreds, before they’ve even been released. The latest set, Phantasmal Flames, had a rare special illustration Charizard that was beingvalued at more than £600before anyone had even found one. When a pack of cards retails at about £4, there’s a huge potential profit to be had.This has led to a speculative stock market developing around the card game with adults snapping up all of the cards they can get their hands on, making it impossible for kids, who may actually want to collect them or play the game associated with the cards, to get their hands on it.It’s become quite unpleasant at times. I’ve heard of stores where people have been attacked or there have been robberiesOnline, via retailers such as Amazon, you can only request to buy Pokémon cards, after which everyone is entered into an opaque raffle for the chance to buy them. In the real world, meanwhile, resellers will queue for hours outside shops, hover around shelves as they’re being restocked and buy up every item before anyone else can see it – all just to buy boxes that are often kept sealed for later resale.“My staff have had customers threatening to come back and rip their heads off,” says Ben Thyer, owner of BathTCG – an independent shop specialising in trading card games. “It’s become quite unpleasant at times. I’ve heard of other stores where people have been attacked or there have been robberies. We’ve even seen people who buy our products and list them immediately on Facebook, while still in our carrier bags, or sell it right outside the shop. We’re even anxious to put stuff on the shelf for the public because we just don’t want to entice that sort of behaviour. We used to sell whole boxes of booster packs but now we’ve had to stop doing that, and even place limits on the individual packs.”View image in fullscreen‘My staff have had customers threatening to come back and rip their heads off’ … Ben Thyer, owner of BathTCG.Photograph: Daniella LucasFinley Pink, from Keynsham, travelled to BathTCG to arrive almost two hours before opening time to secure some cards at the recent launch of the Phantasmal Flames set. He was first in a line of 40 people. “This is the first set I’ve arrived early for, as I’ve been unable to get cards at other times. It’s a real struggle to find them,” he tells us. “Scalpers are making it impossible to find cards. It’s crazy and YouTubers talking up the money are making things even crazier!”Adding to the issue of scalpers is the popularity of YouTubers and TikTok influencers recording themselves opening packs, flicking through the contents at mesmerising speed, and listing the card values as they go, exaggerating reactions when they find a “hit”. Common cards are discarded, and only high-value cards matter. The joy of collecting or playing for fun is no longer the point – it’s all about maximising “value”.Pete Sessions, a project manager from Bristol, attended a Pokémon play night at the shop with his son Alfie and is concerned about influencers’ impact on the hobby for his child. “He’s been into Pokémon for a few years, but just got into collecting the cards over the past six months – I’ve had to ask shops when their stock drop days are just to try to find some,” he tells us. “Alfie watches YouTubers and he’s become very aware of the ‘value’ of cards. I’m worried about the perception that it’s easy to make loads of money, when that probably isn’t the case.”“People are opening these amazing cards on stream, but you don’t know how many thousands of packs they’ve probably gone through, or how much money they’ve spent,” adds Thyer. “So then they feed you the good stuff – that dopamine hit – and you think: ‘Oh, I can do that!’ And then you spend a silly amount of money hoping to get one hit.”The hype around potentially making hundreds of pounds by just opening a pack of cards has resulted in a volatile market, to the point that people now use apps such asCollectrto track their card portfolio for price rises and falls. It’s also led to devious practices such as selling fake cards, or opening and resealing packs after swapping out any rare cards.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toPushing ButtonsFree weekly newsletterKeza MacDonald's weekly look at the world of gamingEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Cards can be sent to independent organisations, who rate and seal cards to potentially increase their value, depending on the grade they’re given. Card shows have now become a staple up and down the country, where hobbyists looking for their favourite cards are surrounded by those making trade deals worth, sometimes, tens of thousands.Despite the fact that The Pokémon Company printed10.2bn cardsin the year to March 2025, they’re still struggling to keep up with demand. When approached for comment, it shared astatement from seven months ago, saying that the company is “actively working to print more of the impacted Pokémon TCG products as quickly as possible and at maximum capacity”.Fortunately there are signs that the reseller market is starting to correct itself as more supply for older sets has started to trickle back on to shelves. “There are signs of the market cracking – prices of singles are coming down, sealed products are coming down. People aren’t as ferocious as they once were,” Thyer says. “There’s also a lot of people now thinking, ‘Christmas is soon and I need some money because I’ve not made what I was hoping for [from reselling cards]’. So we’ll see it dip, but then early 2026 brings Pokémon’s 30th anniversary, so I think we’ll see another crazy period.”While many shops have now adjusted booster pack pricing to reflect their perceived value and make the most of the Pokémon card boom, BathTCG refuses to give into that temptation. “We won’t do it to our customers,” Thyer says. “It’s hard as a business owner to say, ‘I don’t want to make more money’, but I don’t want to be another one of those shops remembered for scalping. Once the bubble bursts and everything goes back to normal, hopefully people will remember that we protected our community and looked after our players – that we ensured our local customers got cards at reasonable prices.”Explore more on these topicsPokémonGamesCollectingChildrenShoppingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Unable to describe Britain’s position, hemanagedonly a hope of “lasting” peace. This reveals a British state that has been hollowed out, as well as the diminishing returns of a political order built for another age. For decades, UK leaders assumed that the US would underwrite Europe’s security; that, as Washington’s closest ally, Britain would punch above its weight; and that British institutions would stabilise order, if not justice, in turbulent times. That world has gone.Monday’s Downing Street summit with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and the German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, threw the dilemma that Sir Keir faces into sharp relief. Mr Macron could speak of thecardsin Europe’s hand; Germany’s leader could voicescepticismabout American proposals. Even Mr Zelenskyy, fighting for national survival, could pithily articulate why heneededboth Europe and the US. Each spoke from within a political system that, however imperfect, has begun adapting to a post-American world. Britain has not – and, under its present leadership, shows littleinclinationto even envision one.Britain’s shrinking strategic autonomy and civic purpose is the result of a financial system that underpins its economic imbalance. The country is led by a prime minister who speaks of a “moral mission” to transform Britain while embracing a hyper-cautious spending programme. His appeals to civic unionism assume a coherent political community with shared interests, but the old solidarities ofclassandregionhave frayed; Scotland,WalesandNorthern Irelandpull in divergent directions; and society has withered under decades of managerialism andmarketisation.Financialisationhas undermined the basis of a sovereign state: overvaluing sterling, gutting manufacturing and driving private debt as capital chases speculation overproduction. It is no surprise that Britainlacksthe industrial depth to arm Ukraine, the budgetary flexibility to shape European security and the diplomatic leverage to challenge a US administration bent on forcing a premature settlement. The prime minister’s deference reflects not only conviction but constraint.The British state tradition – dependent onelite stewardship rather than civic engagement– has reached the limits of its utility. It once enabled decisive action; today it produces managerial caution. Britain’s leaders have authority, but not the imagination to reinvent it. This is most evident in the dominance of the Treasury, which continues to define the limits of what is possible. After years of being unfairly targeted, the civil service has retreated to the sidelines. Political parties have become electoral machines rather than representing a wider collective purpose. From that perspective, Sir Keir’s stance is a feature, not a bug, of the system.Nostalgic appeals to “a special relationship” that no longer exists will not renew Britain. That demands a profound reimagining of the nation’s constitutional, economic and geopolitical identity. The prime minister’s response toUS manoeuvres over Ukrainereveals a leader trapped within a fading order. The tragedy is not just that he cannot meet the moment, but that neither can the British state. Until the country’s politics can move on from past glories, it will continue to produce leaders who mirror the state they inherit. Even if they are dutiful and conscientious, they will still be lost.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Better to adopt the precautionary principle with high-stakes scienceMon 8 Dec 2025 13.08 ESTLast modified on Mon 8 Dec 2025 14.51 ESTShareIt is fitting that this week’sUN environment talksare in Nairobi, with Africa shaping the global climate conversation. The continent’s diplomats are dealing with the vexed question of whether it is wise to try to cool the planet by dimming the sun’s rays. While not on the formal summit agenda, on the sidelines they arearguingthat it’s time to stop promoting solar geoengineering technology as a solution to global heating. It’s hard to disagree.African nations have acted because they don’t want their continent to become atest bedfor unproven schemes to spray particles into the high atmosphere to reflect sunlight away from Earth for a small, uncertain cooling gain. They point toenvironmental, ethical and geopolitical risks. That’s why the continent is pushing for a global “non-use” agreement that would rule out public funding, outdoor experiments, patenting and official promotion of these technologies.The reason for a moratorium is obvious: solar geoengineering doesn’t cut greenhouse-gas emissions. The potential side-effects include altered rainfall patterns and the consequential pressure on food systems. Then there is the risk of a sharp temperature spike if the interventions were ever halted – the so-calledtermination shock.African nations’ opposition was such that they forced the withdrawal of aSwiss-backedresolution on solar radiation modification at last year’s UN talks.Yet an industry is being built on the idea that someone can take charge of the global thermostat. AUS–Israeli firmis developing a spraying system for future “cooling services” to offer to governments. Other nations are pushing back. Mexicobannedsolar geoengineering experiments in 2023, after an unauthorised trial over its territory by a US startup.Academics have alreadywarnedthat the UK became the first “major government” to significantly fund solar radiation modification (SRM) through itsAdvanced Research and Invention Agency(Aria). It is now backing scientists to research “climate cooling’” hardware and small-scale field tests. Other scientists describe the move as naive, poorly governed and scientifically incapable of proving SRM safe. Ministers ought to pull back.Research programmes have politics. Hardware and careers get built. Risky tech acquires well-funded backers. The actions of the US, the world’s largest producer ofoilandgas, should be studied. The Trump administration has made “American energy dominance” the core of its economic strategy. Solar geoengineering offers a way to manage temperature risk without loosening the carbon economy’s grip. Controlling both the world’s energy supply and the global thermostat has obvious appeal to the White House – and its billionaire backers.African governments’callfor a non-use agreement for solar geoengineering – echoing the precedents oflandmine and chemical weapons bans– is a recognition that some technologies shift power so sharply that they create unmanageable risks. A line has to be drawn. The precautionary principle is used with other novel technologies. Why not here? The point is clearly that this power can’t be left to a few.Africa’s call should be taken seriously. None of this weakens climate policy. It would instead focus minds on measures that address the climate emergency: cutting fossil fuel use, investing in renewables – and paying foradaptationwhere damage is already baked in.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Labour government announced it wouldban new oil and gas licencesin the North Sea, strengthen a windfall tax and accelerate phasing out of fossil-fuel subsidies.These are not symbolic gestures. They are an acknowledgment that the global energy system is shifting and that mature economies must shift with it.And they came in the same week thatcatastrophic floods swept across south-east Asia, killing more than 1,000 people and displacing over a million. The real-world imperative to transition off fossil fuels has never been so urgent.But, at the exact moment the UK stepped forward,Canadastepped back.Ottawa signed a newMemorandum of Understanding with Albertato support a new oil sands pipeline that would facilitate increased production of fossil fuels. The deal woulddelay methane regulations, cancel anoil and gas emissions capandexempt the provincefrom clean electricity rules. All this comes as leaders are liftingenvironmental-assessment requirementsformajor projects,preparing to weakengreenwashing laws and suspending Canada’selectric vehicle sales mandate. The MP Steven Guilbeault resigned from Mark Carney’s cabinet rather than defend the retreat.To defeat the global Goliaths devastating our planet, we must raise an army of Davids | Peter LewisRead moreThe contrast could not be sharper: while climate effects intensify and economies pivot, Canada is reinforcing the very industries driving the crisis.Supporters insist the prime minister is being pragmatic – that expanding oil and gas is simply being “realistic”. Instead, it’s a twisted notion that ignores reality – the catastrophic flooding across south-east Asia and Sri Lanka; the mounting toll of drought and heat, fire and storm.Government and industry point to carbon capture and storage (CCS) as the technological fix that can allow Canada to keep expanding oil. But CCS has underperformed for decades, despite billions in public funding, as documented by theInternational Energy Agency.Even if CCS functioned perfectly, it addresses only production emissions, roughly 20% of a barrel’s climate pollution. The remaining 80% comes when the oil is burned, according toIPCC life-cycle assessments. Expanding pipelines while pointing to CCS is like telling someone with lung cancer to smoke more but use filtered cigarettes.Internationally, the commitment is crystal clear. At COP28, in Dubai in 2023, Canada, the UK, and 190 countries agreed for the first time to transition away from fossil fuels. You do not “phase out” something by building more of it. A pipeline enabling1m additional barrelsa daypushes Canada in the opposite direction of what it has already promised.At the same time, other nations are working cooperatively to accelerate the phase-out. Eighty countries support the development of a roadmap to phase out fossil fuels at the recent climate change negotiations in Brazil. Eighteen countries are now participating in dialogues to develop aFossil Fuel Treaty. Colombia and the Netherlands will co-host the first global diplomatic conference on fossil-fuel phase-out next April – the world’s first such meeting dedicated to this purpose.Leadership is emerging. Alliances are forming. Momentum is growing. Meanwhile, Canada seems to be turning back the clock despite the opposition of First Nations who vow to protect the Great Bear Sea from oil tankers.Nation states are increasingly choosing a side: ignore the science and the growing floods and fires or choose“life over death”, as Gustavo Petro, the president of Colombia, said when discussing why the fifth-largest coal exporter has committed to ending fossil-fuel expansion and is working to design a Fossil Fuel Treaty. With scientists now telling us that air pollution due primarily to fossil fuels iskilling 5 million people a yearwhile the world sees one death every minute due to lethal heat, afossil fuel phase-out is literally choosing life over death.The UK deserves recognition for its decision: leadership shapes markets and shifts public expectations. This year, investments in renewable energy were double that of fossil fuel investments. In 2024, China installed more solar than the rest of theworld combined. China and the UK are not dreaming. They are responding to reality. The world is turning a corner but the transition is not inevitable, nor will it be fast enough to avoid the worst impacts of the climate crisis unless new fossil fuel expansion is constrained.Carney built his reputation by warning that climate inaction threatens economic stability and that finance must align with the reality of a warming world. Instead, he is overseeing decisions that deepen Canada’s dependence on an industry whose expansion directly fuels the disasters already devastating communities.Canada talks about how critical it is to skate to where the puck will be, not where it currently is. But right now, the country is skating backwards.Tzeporah Berman is a Canadian environmental activist, campaigner and writerExplore more on these topicsCanadaOpinionClimate crisisOilAmericascommentShareReuse this content"

We know this pattern because we have seen it ourselvesMon 8 Dec 2025 06.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 8 Dec 2025 08.57 ESTShareFor years,Jeffrey Epsteinconjured a kind of grotesque fascination: the private island, the powerful friends, the whispered allegations. But focusing on the lurid details of his life and eventual death obscures the far more unsettling truth his case lays bare. Epstein’s story is not really about one man’s depravity. It is about a system – legal, cultural and institutional – engineered to protect the powerful through silence. His crimes thrived not because they were hidden, but because the people who knew were coerced, encouraged or more than willing to shut up.Silence was not incidental to Epstein’s success. It was central to it. And in this, he was hardly unique.The most revealing document in the entire Epstein saga is one of the first to come to light: the non-prosecution agreement the Department of Justice quietly signed in 2007, shielding Epstein from federal charges and insulating unnamed “co-conspirators”. The girls he had abused – minors the government waslegally obligated to inform– were kept in the dark. The message was unmistakable: protecting powerful men mattered more than honoring the voices of the girls they harmed.Even now, after Congress forced President Trump’s hand to mandate the release of the Epstein files, the Department of Justice has not committed to full disclosure. After everything we have learned in the nearly two decades since Epstein pleaded guilty to sex with a minor, the culture of silence is so powerful that it is unclear when, or even if, his survivors will ever truly receive justice.This pattern echoes across institutions and industries. When abuse occurs, the first instinct is too often containment, not accountability. Corporations draft non-disclosure agreements that muzzle employees. Organizations force workers into arbitration, protecting executives while survivors are bound by confidentiality and pushed out the door. Even government agencies, as in Epstein’s case, have shown a willingness to trade transparency for expediency.We know this pattern because we have seen it ourselves. Nearly a decade ago, we came forward to allege sexual harassment and retaliation against the former Fox News chairman and chief executive Roger Ailes and the network he ran, respectively. We each had to jump through hoops for our cases to be public, battling silencing mechanisms to bring our claims to light. And yet, long after Ailes’s death in 2017, we are still bound by NDAs that prevent us from sharing our stories. The priority, time and again, is to sweep accountability under the rug, even if it comes at the expense of the truth.What the Epstein case and many like it expose is the architecture that protects predators long before the public ever hears their names. It is built from familiar materials: forced arbitration clauses, airtight NDAs, closed-door settlements, and a culture of retaliation that make speaking out dangerous. These tools do not simply resolve disputes – they suppress them. And that suppression creates the conditions in which serial abuse becomes not just possible, but predictable.The language of these mechanisms is bureaucratic, even dull. But their real purpose is simple: silence. Silence that keeps survivors isolated. Silence that prevents patterns from coming into view. Silence that allows predators to move from institution to institution with their reputations intact.Consider how many adults crossed paths with Epstein’s operation – staff, business associates, social friends, lawyers, financial managers. Many surely suspected what was happening and some certainly knew. But secrecy functions as a kind of social gravity: if everyone stays quiet, no one stands out. Epstein didn’t need to silence every person he encountered. The architecture around him did much of that work for him.In this sense, the Epstein case is not an anomaly but a magnifying glass. It shows us how private power, institutional incentives, and legal structures align to smother survivors’ voices long before a journalist or prosecutor ever gets involved. But we should not rely on exposés and avoidable tragedies to break silence. The cost of that approach is too high, and the damage to survivors too enduring.In 2022, we helped to pass two federal laws that cracked the closet door open. The Ending Forced Arbitration for Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Act ensures that survivors can bring their claims to court rather than being sent into the secret chamber of forced arbitration. The Speak Out Act limits the use of NDAs that silence survivors before misconduct even occurs. These reforms chip away at the secrecy that has long shielded predators. They also send a signal: institutions can no longer count on silence as a default outcome.Still, this work is only beginning. If we want to ensure that another Epstein cannot hide in plain sight, we must confront not only the individuals who commit abuse but also the systems that shield them. That means rewriting laws, changing culture, and rejecting the idea that forcing survivors into silence is the way it should be, because it has always been this way.All survivors deserve more than whispered sympathy. The real scandal was never Epstein alone. It was the silence that allowed him to get away with his crimes for so long and that still allows his co-conspirators to get away with them years later.Gretchen Carlson is a journalist, bestselling author and internationally recognized advocate for women’s rights.

He posted avideoon 5 September showing a new bronze plaque being affixed to his door reading: “Pete Hegseth Secretary of War.”His splendid new designation, not established by the Congress as required by law, was purely notional and performative, announced by Donald Trump in an executive order that carried no legal weight, but befitted Hegseth’s self-conceit as warrior-in-chief. He now had the title to go with the tattoos: the crusader cross; “Deus vult”, or “God wills it”, the crusader battle cry; the sniper rifle against the background of an American flag; and the cross and sword inspired by Matthew 10:34: “Do not think that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I have not come to bring peace, but a sword.”Three days earlier, on 2 September, he was reported to have given a verbal order for a drone strike against two unidentified men desperately hanging on to the smoking pieces of their shattered boat in the Caribbean after nine members of their crew had already been blasted. “Kill everybody,” was the order, according to theWashington Poston 28 November. It was the first of 21 strikes that the Pentagon states have so far killed 82 people who are said to have been “narco-terrorists”, though their identities are unknown. Hegseth denied knowledge of the second strike.The day after, Donald Trump posted a video of the strike blowing up the small boat. Hegseth appeared on Fox News to promote the attack and show the video. “That was definitely not artificial intelligence. I watched it live,” he boasted.Hegseth’s account was the first in a series of constantly shifting stories, accompanied by his refusal to provide senators and House members with information for months, followed by rounds of finger-pointing from Trump and Hegseth about who gave the order or knew about it, and accusations of scapegoating claiming Adm Frank M “Mitch” Bradley, in charge of special operations, was being set up to take the fall. Bradley would later say that he gave the order.The question of whether Hegseth had committed a criminal act was immediately raised in response to the Post report in astatementissued on 29 November by the Former Jags Working Group, which “unanimously considers both the giving and the execution of these orders, if true, to constitute war crimes, murder, or both. Our group was established in February 2025 in response to SECDEF’s firing of the army and air force judge advocates general and his systematic dismantling of the military’s legal guardrails. Had those guardrails been in place, we are confident they would have prevented these crimes.”Once the Former Jags Working Group published its statement, which included a detailed legal brief concluding that “anyone who issues or follows such orders can and should be prosecuted for war crimes, murder, or both”, the video released earlier, on 18 November, by six Democratic members of Congress, all former military or intelligence officers, which discussed the legal obligation of military service members to refuse unlawful orders, was thrown into high relief. Trump had accused them of “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH!”, though he later claimed he was “not threatening death”.Hegseth called them the “Seditious Six” and announced an FBI investigation targeting Senator Mark Kelly, a Democrat from Arizona, a former combat navy captain and astronaut. “So ‘Captain’ Kelly,”sneeredHegseth in a tweet, “not only did your sedition video intentionally undercut good order & discipline … but you can’t even display your uniform correctly. Your medals are out of order & rows reversed. When/if you are recalled to active duty, it’ll start with a uniform inspection.” With his derision, Hegseth launched himself into face-to-face combat with a genuine war hero, at least on X.Four days later, the Post story appeared, cascading into a full-blown scandal with potentially severe legal consequences for all involved. When Hegseth was dubbed “secretary of war”, no mere “secretary of defense”, he was confident he was on the offensive at last – against “sedition” – but the boat strikes landed him in a quagmire that is the apotheosis of his “warrior ethos”.In 2021, Maj Hegseth of the US national guard’s individual ready reserve was effectively drummed out of the service when officersidentifiedhim as an “insider threat” connected to extremist causes. He was branded for his tattoos, which he said “was unfair”. His resentment was raw. “Twenty years … and the military I loved, I fought for. I revered … spit me out,” he wrote in hiscri de coeur, The War on Warriors. “While I was writing this book, I separated from an Army that didn’t want me anymore. The feeling was mutual – I didn’t want this Army anymore either.”Hegseth thought of himself fighting a new war against the “elites” who had stigmatized and isolated him. “Our ‘elites’ are like the feckless drug-addled businessmen at Nakatomi Plaza, looking down on Bruce Willis’ John McClane inDie Hard,” he wrote. “But there will come a day when they realize they need John McClane – that in fact their ability to live in peace and prosperity has always depended on guys like him being honorable, powerful, and deadly.” The “elites” were weaklings in a self-induced haze, while he was the strong and sober one, the killer they did not know they needed to save them.War crimes, particularly avoiding being held to account for them, have been the great defining cause of Hegseth’s career. Referring to the Geneva conventions against war crimes, Hegseth wrote that US soldiers “should not fight by rules written by dignified men in mahogany rooms eighty years ago”. In his book, herecountedhis contempt for being briefed in Iraq by a Jag officer giving guidance about the rules of engagement, referring to the Jags as “jagoffs”. His company, Charlie company, took the name “Kill company”, and posted a whiteboard with the number of kills, the “kill board”, which tallied up dead civilians. Hegseth defended the commanding officer, who “did cross the line at certain times”, but was “an American hero and a trained warrior”, tothe New Yorkerin 2009.Hegseth attracted Trump’s attention after he was promoted to co-host of Fox & Friends in 2018. Off the set, his life was chaotic, but his behavior was also responsible for his rise. He had been favored with airtime while having a relationship with its executive producer, Jennifer Rauchet, whom he impregnated. He was alsoaccusedof sexually assaulting a woman at a conservative conference in California, which he denied and the local police did not substantiate, and to whom he paid a $50,000 settlement. After his second divorce, he would eventually marry the producer.On air, he was a strident advocate for the pardoning of three men convicted or accused of war crimes. Army Lt Clint Lorance had been convicted of second-degree murder for ordering his troops to fire on three unarmed Afghan men. Green Beret Maj Mathew Golsteyn was accused of killing an unarmed Afghan man he had detained and of burning his body. On Fox & Friends, Hegsethsaid: “If he committed premeditated murder then I did as well … Put us all in jail.”Navy Seal Eddie Gallagher in particular had become a martyr figure among the Maga faithful. The charges against him described especially gruesome behavior. He was accused of stabbing a 17-year-old captive fighter in the neck, posing with him before the killing and his body afterward for a video and photos. Gallagher was also charged with shooting civilians, including an elderly man and a young girl, which hedenied. Ultimately, Gallagher was convicted only of posing with the corpse. Hegseth lobbied for his and the others’ pardons, and featured Gallagher and Golsteyn, his band of brothers, on an hour-long special on Fox called Modern Warriors, where hetoutedGallagher as a “war hero”. Trump granted three acts of clemency on 15 November 2019, the success of Hegseth’s advocacy.During Hegseth’s confirmation hearing, his disorderly life was turned inside out, making the process into a soap opera featuring stories about his alleged alcoholism, which hecalled“anonymous smears” and accusations of sexual misconduct. He promised that if confirmed, he would not drink. But some senators homed in on his view on war crimes. In response, Hegseth attacked “politically correct and overbearing rules”, and said that he would make sure that “lawyers aren’t getting in the way”. When Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island, the ranking Democrat on the armed services committee,askedhim about his vulgar remark about Jags as “jagoffs”, Hegseth offered his definition of “a Jag officer who puts his or her own priorities in front of the warfighters, their promotions, their medals, in front of having the backs of those are making the tough calls on the frontlines”.Shortly after assuming office, Hegsethfiredthe senior lawyers for the army, navy and air force without cause or performance reviews, and ordered hundreds of Jags to report to the justice department, removing them from their duties advising commanders on the laws of war and instead assigning them to work mainly on immigration issues. Eventually, some of them created the Former Jags Working Group.In March, Hegseth used a group chat on the Signal messaging service to coordinate an airstrike against the Houthis in Yemen. On Signal, Hegsethtexteddetailed battle plans, down to the aircraft that would be involved, the timing of missile strikes and targets. The then national security adviser, Michael Waltz, inadvertently included in the chat the editor of the Atlantic, Jeffrey Goldberg, who listened in to the operation and published the texts of the real-time internal exchanges. HegsethslammedGoldberg as a “deceitful” journalist who “peddles in garbage”. Hegseth vehemently denied that the information he shared on the chat was classified, but the Pentagon’s inspector generalfoundthat he had violated security and endangered troops, sending “sensitive, nonpublic, operational information” on his private cellphone, in a report that dropped on 4 December, amid the uproar over the boat strikes.Hegseth cleared the path for those strikes by forcing out the head of the Southern Command, four-star Adm Alvin Holsey, who, while supportive of interdicting drugs, raised serious questions about the legality of lethal attacks. “You’re either on the team or you’re not. When you get an order, you move out fast and don’t ask questions,” Hegseth told Holsey, theWall Street Journalreported, based on notes from a participant in the meetings. Holsey resigned after less than a year in his post, “a de facto ouster”.Four weeks after the first attack, on 28 September, Hegseth assembled military leaders from their posts around the globe to hear him expostulate on his doctrine. “We unleash overwhelming and punishing violence on the enemy,” hetoldthem. “We also don’t fight with stupid rules of engagement … just common sense, maximum lethality and authority for warfighters. You kill people and break things for a living.” His further precepts included “no more beardos” and “fat generals”, and essentially eliminating women from combat roles. “It will also mean that weak men won’t qualify because we’re not playing games. This is combat. This is life or death,” he said. He lectured the commanders: “If the words I’m speaking today are making your heart sink, then you should do the honorable thing and resign.”The story of Holsey’s resignation had not yet been reported publicly. Hegseth’s warning to the senior military leaders either to follow his orders without question or resign was an oblique but obvious reference to Holsey. The generals and admirals would certainly have known the circumstances for the abrupt resignation of the head of the Southern Command. Their response to Hegseth’s performance was stone silence.On the day the Washington Post story broke, Hegseth defiantlypostedon his X site: “We have only just begun to kill narco-terrorists.” Two days later, on 30 November, heposteda cartoon depiction of a popular children’s figure in books and a Canadian TV series, Franklin the Turtle, who inhabits a gentle world that provides lessons for preschoolers. In Hegseth’s version, under the heading, A Classic Franklin Story: Franklin Targets Narco Terrorists, Franklin is wearing a helmet and flak jacket and has an American flag tattoo on his arm, and stands on the runner of a helicopter and smiles as he wields a bazooka to shoot missiles at open boats. Hegseth added a caption: “For your Christmas wish list …” Franklin the Turtle had been transformed into the icon of Hegseth’s “warrior ethos”. But the cartoon was also Hegseth’s projection of himself. He had gone from John McClane in Die Hard to a death-dealing Franklin the Turtle.On 2 December, seated next to Trump in a cabinet meeting, Hegsethofferedhis latest convoluted explanation. “I watched that first strike live,” he said. “As you can imagine at the Department of War, we got a lot of things to do. So I didn’t stick around for the hour and two hours or whatever where all the sensitive site exploitation digitally occurs. So I moved on to my next meeting.” While he had more important things to do, he said, he learned “hours later” that Bradley had made the “correct decision to ultimately sink the boat”. Hegseth added: “We have his back.”Hegseth did not stop talking, but babbled on: “I did not personally see survivors, but I stand – because the thing was on fire. That was exploded and fire or smoke, you can’t see anything. You got digital. This is called the fog of war.”Even then, he would not stop talking. “This is what you and the press don’t understand,” he said. “You sit in your air-conditioned offices or up on Capitol Hill and you nitpick and you plant fake stories in the Washington Post.” Meaning he was the victim of a conspiracy.But in his attempt to mount his defense, Hegseth had misstated the precept of the Prussian theorist of war, Carl von Clausewitz, to whom “the fog of war” is attributed. By “fog”, von Clausewitz meant the rapid obsolescence of the original war plan when confronted with the “uncertainty” of battle. About the missile strikes killing 82 men in open boats, including the two adrift in the ocean, however, there was no “uncertainty”.On 4 December, a bipartisan congressional group viewed the video of the 2 September attack for the first time. Representative Jim Himes of Connecticut, the ranking member of the House intelligence committee, emerged tostate: “What I saw in that room was one of the most troubling things I’ve seen in my time in public service … You have two individuals in clear distress, without any means of locomotion, with a destroyed vessel, were killed by the United States.”Himes also revealed that Bradley had testified that “there had not been a ‘kill them all’ order, and that there was not an order to grant no quarter”. The admiral took the responsibility on to himself, placing himself in potential jeopardy. But Bradley’s statement did not settle the larger issue of whether the whole mission itself and the killing of 82 people so far is a “war crime, murder, or both”, under the Geneva conventions and the Uniform Code of Military Justice, or both. The Democrats who witnessed the video called for its public release and Hegseth’s dismissal. Some Republicans defended the attack – Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansascalledit “righteous”.Thefirst trialfor war crimes after the second world war involved the killing of survivors of an attack at sea. On 13 March 1945, a Nazi U-boat, U-852, sank a Greek steamer, the Peleus. Twelve merchant seamen survived, clinging to rafts and debris. The commander, Kapitänleutnant (Lt) Heinz Eck, ordered them to be killed. Three men ultimately survived to tell the tale. U-852 was captured by the Royal Navy on 2 May. Eck and his officers were tried under a British military war crimes court from 17 to 20 October 1945, just weeks before the Nuremberg international tribunal began its proceedings. Eck’s defense was that his action was an “operational necessity”. His officers said they were following orders. On 30 November, Eck and two of his officers were executed by firing squad.“What do you think of firing squads?” Trump ruminated to some advisers before the 2024 election. He “mused about the possibility of creating a flashy, government-backed video-ad campaign that would accompany a federal revival of these execution methods”, according to a report inRolling Stone. “In Trump’s vision, these videos would include footage from these new executions, if not from the exact moments of death.”But before the blindfold and the last cigarette at the wall, the solution might just be pardons or clemency, like those Hegseth lobbied for for Eddie Gallagher and the others, vindication in his eyes of accused war criminals as war heroes.Sidney Blumenthal, former senior adviser to President Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton, has published three books of a projected five-volume political life of Abraham Lincoln:A Self-Made Man,Wrestling With His AngelandAll the Powers of Earth.

I was a little taken aback: people don’t normally react that way to journalists. Trust in the news media is low, andDonald Trump’s unfair cries of “fake news” and his efforts to depict journalists as “enemies of the people” have taken their toll.So too have the discouraging moves made this year by storied news organizations such as the Washington Post, the Los Angeles Times and CBS News, where commercial interests or pro-Trump politics are affecting the journalism. Too many powerful media people are trying to cozy up to the president, rather than support journalism that holds him accountable for his words and actions.Given that atmosphere, the poll worker’s words of thanks for the Guardian were especially nice to hear. But, in a way, her sentiments are not all that surprising.The Guardian, I’ve noticed, enjoys a positive reputation with people who care deeply about engaging in their communities and helping to support democracy.That’s for good reason.Because I write about the news media, sometimes as a tough critic, it’s not unusual for people to ask me to recommend what I consider good news sources. I do have a list of recommendations, and the Guardian is always high on that list. When I mention it (always first disclosing that I’m a regular Guardian columnist), I give a few reasons.First, the Guardian is fair and cares about accuracy, but it doesn’t tie itself in knots to treat a would-be authoritarian such as President Trump like a perfectly normal politician. I see a lot of that normalization elsewhere, but far less of it at the Guardian.I also find the Guardian more obviously mission-driven than a lot of other news organizations. Journalists at the Guardian, including top editors and leadership, seem to understand that the press has an important role in sustaining democracy, and they approach that understanding with clarity and without apology. This means that there’s less of what I call “performative neutrality” – a kind of false balance in political coverage – than I see in other places. Treating unequal things as if they were equal doesn’t equate to fairness.I’m impressed too by the lack of a paywall at the Guardian. Yes, readers often are asked to contribute and become supporters, but everyone has access to Guardian journalism. The Guardian’s business model is different from that of news outlets owned by billionaires or multinational companies. It’s run by the UK-based Scott Trust, which has a journalistic purpose, not by a massive corporate entity whose shareholders are demanding higher profits.That’s important because, more and more, the “free” media out there are of far lower quality than the journalism offered by organizations whose business model is based on mandatory paid subscriptions. And, simply put, if you don’t pay, you don’t have access. The effect is to exclude too many lower-income people from vetted, accurate news. That’s certainly not good for democracy.Finally, I like many of the Guardian’s voices, such as Moira Donegan writing on gender and society, or David Smith in Washington, smartly analyzing politics, or Jeremy Barr (my former Post colleague and a fair-minded, deeply sourced media reporter), who joined recently. There are many more.Democracy demands mission-driven journalism that is fair and accurate – and accessible – so that informed citizens can play their role in our society. That’s why the Guardian is high up on my recommendation list – and it’s why, when I see fundraising missives at the end of Guardian stories, I’m not annoyed. I merely hope that they continue to be successful so that the Guardian can keep doing what it does so well. I’m proud to be a part of it.You can make a year-end gift to the Guardian here.All support is gratefully received, but a recurring contribution – even a small monthly amount – is most impactful, helping sustain our work throughout the year ahead. It takes just 37 seconds to give. Thank you.Explore more on these topicsThe GuardianOpinionDonald TrumpNewspapersNewspapers & magazinesUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

A wise public would see red flags; instead it sees entertainmentMon 8 Dec 2025 01.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 8 Dec 2025 03.47 ESTShareOne upside of adversity is art, inspiring cultural output that seeks to process and channel suffering. “I’ll say one thing about Thatcher, some fantastic songs were written during her reign,” said the Irish singer Christy Moore once – beforebelting outa goosebump-raising rendition of Ordinary Man by Peter Hames, a song about the 1980s recession. That is, so far, the only upside ofthe publicationof Olivia Nuzzi’s book American Canto, an affliction to journalism, politics and publishing: there has been some fantastic writing since it all kicked off.Masterfulreviews. Very funnycommentary. Scathinganalysis. But first, a summary of events for readers of this column, most of whom I assume are well-adjusted, offline people, with better things to do with their time than follow what can only be described as a nichebeef. Nuzzi is (or perhaps was, keep reading) a celebrated US political journalist who had a “digital affair” with Robert F Kennedy Jr while he was running for president, broke all sorts of journalistic rules while doing so, andwas firedfrom her job at New York magazine. RFK Jr went on to become Donald Trump’s anti-vaccine health secretary, Nuzzi has published a book about the whole affair, and her ex-fiance Ryan Lizza – another political journalist – has beendripfeeding revelationsabout how she cheated on him, and a litany of other personal and professional transgressions. There are no heroes here.For a while, it was all good, low-stakes fun for casual observers. And then suddenly, at the risk of sounding po-faced and unable to enjoy a nice little scandal unblemished by sympathetic characters, it wasn’t. Less a diversion, and more the final poisoned fruit of several cross-pollinating strands.A new media landscape has hoved into view. Most of the debacle has been litigated on Substacks, independent podcasts and personal websites. Lizza claimed his belated revelations on his own newsletter about Nuzzi’s infractions, which, he said, included her helping RFK Jr in his run for president bysharing intel from sources, were in the public interest – the public in this instance being those signed up to Lizza’s Substack, who first gained free tidbits before being ushered to a paywall. Nuzzi herself, barring oneglossy profilein the New York Times, has given her exclusive updates to other newsletter writers and podcasters. The froth of it all swirled on social media. Step back, and ask: “But is it journalism?” The answer is: definitely not. But I’m still not surewhatit is.On the face of it we are talking about big and serious things – political and journalistic accountability, the role of the media in the Trump era, “love of country”, as Nuzzi herself puts it. But it all feels like a pantomime performance of such things: to quote Tom Wolfe, journalism as “a cup of tea on the way to … eventual triumph” as something else. And that something else is, above everything, the brand – a person whose most important role is to be the main character, with professional failings and personal squalor as details that make up a colourful, compelling whole. What is most interesting about both Nuzzi and Lizza is their careful plot-curation. Never mind that Lizza sat on what he says is germane information about RFK Jr for months, and that Nuzzi had an undisclosed relationship with a political player while being a political reporter (“I was fired,” sheshot backimpatiently, when pressed really quite gently on her bad behaviour). What you have here folks, is a story! Lizza serialises it in soapy whodunit. Nuzzi writes it in disconnected fragments, casting a soft-focus dream-like filter. Scripted reality, but for journalism.And the story, depending on whom you believe, is either of a woman who fell in love and is being punished for being a talented, beautiful risk-taking enfant terrible, or of a treacherous self-involved narcissist. But it’s really mostly about decay. About Trumpism outside Trump, that heady sense that anything could happen and nothing matters, and everything is so up for grabs that a man such as RFK Jr could manoeuvre himself into one of the highest offices in the land, and a journalist who interviewed him once could emerge as the kingmaker. The question to ask isn’t, “why would you wager so much on a man withdeadly politicsand become obsessed with him and his ambition?” It’s “why not?”Why not? After a Joe Biden presidency that incinerated faith in him and the Democratic establishment, as he clung on way past what was responsible (Nuzzi herself, breaking with the pack,reported ona “conspiracy of silence”). Why not? When the likelihood is that you would be welcomed back into the fold anyway if you got caught, as Nuzzi was when she washired by Vanity Fair(she writes that she was shocked to have been pulled up on her actions at all, as someone who had always been indulged for being “good for business”). And why not, when a sort of general unravellingof the mainstream media is unfolding? Increasingly, parts of it are owned by openly partisan money men, partnering with high-profile ideologically contentious figures such asBari Weiss, now editor-in-chief of CBS News, and the rest arestruggling, open to the life-saving overtures anddiktatsof such money men. Nuzziwas let gofrom Vanity Fair last week, but business is bad, and she will either be good for it, or for somewhere else soon, or simply herselfbecomethe business, in this new growing ecosystem.Out of the sinkholes of journalism and politics rises the journalism influencer. A hybrid, both narrator and protagonist, who scoffs at judgment as either cringe or motivated, and becomes ever more skilled and brazen in detached yarn-spinning; finessing away active roles, complicities and abuse of access.The sad realisation in the queasy aftermath of this heady scandal is that there are no personas more fitting for the time. There may be a cracking chorus of literary and political lament around both Nuzzi and Lizza, but they together are borne forward not only through their own lusts, but also by inexorable forces of political and journalistic degeneration.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Ready or not, Europe is on its ownGeorg RiekelesandVarg FolkmanWe can move from defensive crouch to position of strength but only if we use the economic cards we have against US coercionMon 8 Dec 2025 00.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 8 Dec 2025 10.01 ESTShareEurope is on a trajectory towards nothing less than “civilisational erasure”, the Trump administration claims in its extraordinary newNational Security Strategy, a document that blames European integration and “activities of the European Union that undermine political liberty and sovereignty” for some of the continent’s deepest problems.Everybody should have seen it coming after Washington’s humiliating 28-point plan for Ukraine.JD Vance’s shocking Munich speechin February, in which he suggested that Europe’s democracies were not worth defending was an early red flag. But the new words still land as a shock. The security document is the clearest signal yet of how brutally and transactionally Washington wants to engage with the continent. It marks another phase in Trump’s attempt to reshape Europe in his ideological image while at the same time abandoning it militarily. US policy, the paper says, should enable Europe to “take primary responsibility for its own defence”.Withdrawing US troops from Europe has been a particularly adamant demand of the Maga right. Figures such as Steve Bannon openly argue for “hemispheric defence” – defending the Americas, not Europe. On hisWar Room podcast, Bannon said plainly that: “We’re a Pacific nation … the pivot, the strategic heartland of America, is actually the Pacific.”One of the clearest articulations of US strategic retrenchment has come from a key figure in Trump-era defence thinking:Elbridge Colby,the principal adviser on defence and foreign policy at the Pentagon. In a 2023 policy paper,Getting Strategic Deprioritization Right, Colby and his co-authors laid out the logic behind reducing US commitments in Europe and concentrating resources elsewhere.The starting premise is clear. As one contributor puts it, “the United States does not have, and does not plan to develop, the ability to fight and win major wars inEuropeand Asia simultaneously”. China, they argue, is the decisive theatre, not Europe, and US attention and assets must shift accordingly.Washington has signalled some version of this pivot for more than a decade. Yet European governments have found the idea that the US might actually deprioritise the continent’s security remarkably abstruse. The war inUkrainehas intensified this tension: Europe’s thinking is that a US withdrawal or an imposed, unequal peace would produce chaos in Ukraine and instability across Europe.For Colby this is not in itself a sufficient argument against the US leaving Europe. As he writes: “Instability or even chaos alone is not enough … to judge a deprioritisation effort a failure.” What matters, in his view, is whether the US finds ways to shield itself from the ensuing chaos.The new US security strategy confirms that Washington is increasingly focused on its “Western Hemisphere”. The administration plans to deprioritise issues and missions abroad – including, to some extent, China – to concentrate on domestic security and its immediate neighbourhood. The US naval buildup in the Caribbean, the largestin more than 30 years, underscores this shift.There are reasons to believe that the US will not abandon Europe completely. Protecting roughly$4tn in US investmentson the continent remains a key interest. Yet the direction is unmistakable – Washington is stepping back. The urgent question for Europe is, are we ready for the consequences?Because it is clear that as Washington draws back militarily, it will pull even harder on its other levers: financial power, diplomatic pressure, export controls, trade measures and secondary sanctions. These instruments will increasingly be used to steer Europe in the political direction the US wants. Lenient enforcement, or the scrapping of digital and green rules altogether will be demanded of the EU – as US commerce secretary Howard Lutnickdid last month.All this is happening as the security umbrella above Europe becomes ever thinner. The result is a dangerous asymmetry: less protection and more pressure.Europe risks becoming collateral damage in a prolonged US-China confrontation while no longer enjoying the iron-clad guarantees that once cushioned those shocks. That is a brutal, lose-lose position.If Europe wants to move from a defensive crouch to a posture of strategic agency, it must sustain its surge in defence investment and make it crystal clear that attempts at coercion from Washington or Beijing will be met with forceful countermeasures.Only then can Europe avoid being squeezed between a retreating patron and a mistrustful rival.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This EU humiliation wassupposed to secure US security buy-inand continued support for Ukraine, and yet the opposite is happening. The US’s impulse to disengage from Europe is more powerful than anything an uneven trade concession can offer them.Europe must not repeat that mistake. The next time Washington turns the screws, the EU should be ready to push back, starting with disowning the trade deal and triggering its powerful “anti-coercion instrument” at the first sign of pressure. Only a firm response will register in Washington.If the US is to deprioritise Europe’s security, it has to come at a cost: its influence in the region should follow.

Boys armed with flags and weapons, incited by exhortations from the likes of talkback broadcaster Alan Jones and by text messages asking “every Aussie in the Shire get down to North Cronulla to support the Leb and wog bashing day”.Geographically, the Arab lads of Bankstown and Shire boys of Cronulla were neighbours, but culturally the consequences of infringing West Side Story-beach lines were clear. The 2005 beach riots made international headlines. Southern Cross-tattooed patriots marked their territory, scrawling “100% Aussie pride” in the sand and popularising the slogan: “You flew here, we grew here.”For a young feminist Muslim woman from western Sydney who had just adopted hijab after moving out of home, it highlighted every political nerve I balanced on like a high-wire artist.Cronulla riots 20 years on: have attitudes changed since that hot December day when racial tensions exploded?Read moreI lived in a student dorm in Sydney’s inner west, trying to leave behind a difficult home life and forge a place in a post 9/11, completely white media industry where diversity was not even a corporate buzzword yet. A world where the daily screeching racist headlines about oppressed women, jihadis, Islam, surveillance, Asio, the war on terror and stereotypes of Arab male predators actively abetted violence against “people like us” both at home and abroad.It was a place where Muslim spokespeople were both consumed and reduced to their identities in a reactive and dehumanising news cycle controlled by white executive producers, experts and thinktanks dedicated to nutting out the Muslim “problem”.The riots cemented to me that the beach – painted by pop culture as the iconic Australiana of leisure and pleasure – was not for people like me.Far from being a “glitch”, racism around the water was a historic part of Australian culture, with segregation aimed at Indigenous swimmers enforced in pools until the 70s. Non-whites weren’t locked out from the wealthy water belt of Sydney any more – at least not officially – but we were impeded in more subtle ways.Metaphorically, it highlighted the cultural and racial demarcations not only of Sydney’s postcodes; it was also something that played out in newsrooms, workplaces and public spaces, where black and brown deference to whiteness was not just expected but enforced through the limits of voice, ascension, freedom and movement.They look shocked when my Aussie-accented voice barks back at themIt was against this backdrop of racial machismo and testosterone-fuelled violence in Cronulla that my own tentative foray into beach life began. I learned to swim as an adult and have even competed in ocean races. I have visited almost every beach and lived in every district of Sydney. I have created a career in media.But it has not been without difficulty. Twenty years on, I still have never been to Cronulla beach. Even today it evokes a spectre of fear.My position in “white” areas and industries continues to be contested by racism, creating an anxiety I still feel like a drum in my chest. The long walks and swims suggested by my therapist to recover and relax are often marked by traumatic incidents.Recently, at a golf course, four middle-aged white men demanded my sister and I freeze so they could putt. One of them yelled “currymuncher” and “cunt” when we refused to, threatening to hit us with a golf ball. I felt my heart race. But the model minority in me who usually defers and de-escalates went mute: for the first time in my life, I yelled back. I swore. I told him the path we were on was for walkers, andtheyshould stop, not us. They looked shocked when my Aussie-accented voice barked back at them. I was shocked, too – and surprised at the audacity of my anger, usually internalised, desiccated into depression and curdling into bitterness. The poison exited my system. I felt clean, energised by adrenaline, secretly elated at how bad and mad I was – it was – and how good it felt to fight back.There’s the go-back-to-your country call yelled at the elderly hijabi woman at my local shopping centre. There’s the time my family is racially abused at a Lakemba park, turning a day out into quiet shame. There’s the lady at a shop who hovers over me, asking pointedly “Is your dog allowed here?” when I have rung three times to secure permission.White entitlement and racism are such a part of our cultural waters that refusal and confidence in public life by non-white sport stars, politicians and media figures still feels transgressive. I am shedding the grateful immigrant posture as a survival mechanism, the preening towards whiteness and power, the buying-in to the myths of the colonists who settled here just over 200 years ago who tell me they “own” this place and set the terms of my conditional belonging.It is a myth I am increasingly resisting. It’s reframing Sydney’s “white” areas in my mind as stolen black land upon which I am also a settler. It’s recognising the spiritual power I feel in the water and this stupendously beautiful land as the magic of Country. It’s re-orienting my deference towards this continent’s Blak custodians, the true owners of this land, its waterways, songs, stories and histories for millennia. And when I will visit Cronulla beach for the first time, it will be Dharawal land I’ll be paying my respects to.Sarah Malik is a journalist and author of Desi Girl: On Feminism,Race, Faith and Belonging and Safar: Muslim Women’s Stories of Travel and TransformationExplore more on these topicsSydneyOpinionRacecommentShareReuse this content"

Just the latest rightwing lie peddled by LabourFrances RyanStarmer’s ailing government is happy to pursue ideas like cutting Motability, but all ministers will do is damage lives and themselvesMon 8 Dec 2025 10.28 ESTLast modified on Mon 8 Dec 2025 14.54 ESTShareMonths before the government used the budget to launch plans totackle Motability– the scheme that leases subsidised vehicles with some disability benefits – a website started quietly spying on disabled drivers. Motability Check – run by an unknown third party and now offline – allowed members of the public to type in any number plate and (largely incorrectly) see if it was a car provided by the firm. The purpose appeared simple and disturbing: spot that neighbour who says they have a bad back and check with a few clicks if they are milking the taxpayer.From the spring, the idea that Motability was offering disabled people “free” BMWs and Mercedes began to spread. While the rightwing press suggested someone couldget a vehiclefor “bed wetting”and acne, blue tick accounts on Xgleefully arguedthe only car available to claimants should be cheap, ugly and “have MOTABILITY written on it, preferably in neon”. By October, the narrative had gone mainstream as the supposed scam of free cars was leapt on by theConservativesandReform UK.Fast forward to this winter and Labour has set out plans toend £300ma year of tax breaks and remove premium brands from the scheme. Rachel Reeves even mimicked rightwing memes with her language whenshe announced it: Motability “was set up to protect the most vulnerable, not to subsidise the lease on a Mercedes-Benz”. Meanwhile, Kemi Badenochsaid this weekthe Tories would ban conditions such as anxiety and ADHD outright from being eligible.If 2025 has been the year “welfare reform” reentered the lexicon of British politics, few events sum it up more than the assault on Motability, a policy that has been a lifeline for disabled people for almost 50 years with little fuss.This is partly a story about valid scrutiny of amultibillion-pound bodyhandling public money. Therehasbeen a large growth in Motability recently – with thecustomer base risingby about 200,000 in two years to 815,000 as the nation’s health has declined and disability benefit claims increased. Similarly, it is fair to questionhigh executive payand the company’sreportedlylarge cash reserves.How Motability cuts went from a rightwing online campaign to Rachel Reeves’s budgetRead moreBut it is far more a story about how a mix of misinformation, prejudice and insecurity has reignited an all-too-familiar fire: when living standards are stalling and public services failing, society turns on a minority said to be having it easy at taxpayer expense.From asylum seekers staying in hotels while locals struggle to pay the rent to benefit claimants driving a new car as workersmiss the bus, this year has seen a fixation on what certain – notably marginalised or disadvantaged – groups supposedly get.We are in an era that is in many ways defined by a sense the state no longer provides what the public needs: not just the NHS and schools but libraries, social care, parks and so much else. Add in the fact the squeezed middle isbeing taxed moreand millions of others continue to struggle for the basics, and the idea that there are disabled people getting luxury cars handed to them naturally fuels resentment. That’s only compounded when large sections of the media and political class propagate the now common idea that many of those in receipt of support are notreallydisabled (or for that matter, tax-paying workers).But is any of it actually true? I spoke to experts about the popular claim that the Motability scheme is easy to exploit. “Accessing Motability requires extensive applications, medical evidence, invasive examination, testing and proof of your impairment, and reapplication for support every few years,” said Sophia Kleanthous from Transport for All. “We support many disabled people who have been wrongly denied support, because they’ve struggled to prove that they meet this high bar.”What about the idea someone can get a car because of allegedly minor conditions, such as acne? “Government data shows there are just five people claiming enhanced mobility [of the gateway benefit, personal independence payments] for acne,” says James Taylor from Scope. “The stats don’t show co-conditions, so those people could have multiple other disabilities too.” That means the handful of people with acne who are eligible for a Motability car – but are not necessarily leasing one – could have, say, arthritis as well.The British Association of Dermatologists also confirmed to me that there are ways acne might impact mobility, including rare forms that cancause joint pain. GB Newspundits, funnily enough, aren’t medically qualified.That disabled people should not get a luxury car on the scheme might similarly sound reasonable at first. But take a look at the data and only6% of Motability’s fleetis made up of non-economy brands, while the cost to the taxpayer is exactly the same due to the fact disabled people already pay the extra fee themselves.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Disabled people do that too,” says Kleanthous. “We might need an adapted car with enough height to carry us in our wheelchair or a boot that self closes. Some accessibility features are only on higher-spec vehicles. But the biggest issue is choice. Motability allows us to have a car we need, but we should still be able to choose to pay more to have the car we want.”Look ahead to the new year and more of this is on the horizon, from the government’s plan for special educational needs and disabilities (Send) amid talk of parentsabusing the system, to Wes Streeting’s review of the supposed “over-diagnosis” of mental health issues in light of rising sickness benefit claims.Such ideas appear to be salvation to Keir Starmer’s ailing administration, but it may well find that these only add to its problems. Just as with immigration, capitulating to critics of Motability will never be enough. The goalposts always move: first the issue is said to be disabled people having luxury cars, then tax breaks, then any car at all.There is a way out of this: raising living standards, well-funded public services, and a spirited defence of the safety net and those who rely on it. It will also require an honest conversation about why we are collectively getting sicker and addressing the underlying causes rather than stubbornly assuming there is an epidemic of healthy people faking. That is not a quick fix, but it is the only one that will help heal an increasingly broken social fabric. Making it harder for a disabled person to leave the house is a dark and false solution to a genuine crisis.Frances Ryan is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsDisabilityOpinionBenefitsNewspapers & magazinesLabourAutomotive industryWelfareKeir StarmercommentShareReuse this content"

Privacy concerns, lack of proper consultation with young people, the overlooked negative impact a ban can have on many teens and the lack of parental exemptions are just some of the issues that have been raised since this idea was first floated last year.I’m 15 years old and have a disability. Social media has been a lifeline – why is the government kicking me off? | Ezra ShollRead moreBut in a constantly evolving world, where people of all ages and backgrounds are going online to stay informed, ensuring that young people are not left behind is crucial.It’s not as simple as telling a young person to watch the six o’clock news on free-to-air television, let alone read a physical newspaper. And they’re not all going to be automatically drawn to a news website when the ban comes into effect on 10 December.From my experience with friends and classmates who don’t follow news on a 24/7 basis, the way they’re getting informed is almost always while scrolling onInstagramand TikTok. Having spoken to my younger brother – who is affected by the ban – it’s the same for his cohort as well.Is the ideal form of news consumption short-form videos? Probably not, and it’s definitely not perfect in an age of misinformation and disinformation, especially with the rapid rise of AI-generated content. But in 2025, this is the reality of how so many young people find out the biggest stories of our time.A major subset of the news people see is, of course, political reporting. I’m under no illusion that most young people want to consume politics on a daily basis, but that doesn’t mean they shouldn’t be given opportunities to find out more while using their preferred platforms.I think back to when I first properly used social media as a teenager (my parents would supervise my account during the earliest years of 6 News).Australian politicshas always been one of my strongest personal interests and the ability to speak with other young people about it has allowed me to gain some incredible friendships and connections. This has also allowed me to learn from those with much more experience in this area, something I’m really grateful for.It’s critical for young people stay informed about local politics. For better or worse, this often starts with social media.At this year’s federal election,gen Z voters were being targetedmore than ever before on social media platforms, which we can expect to continue for future elections. Young people should be able to engage in issues that matter to them most online in a safe and meaningful way, instead of being cut off from the platforms that deliver this information.Social media ban: when does it start in Australia, how will it work and what apps are getting banned for under-16s?Read moreAt the same time that this ban comes into force, there are discussions happening in Australia about lowering the voting age to 16, which I support being trialled. Imagine a situation in which a teenager is banned from having a YouTube account one day, to being able to vote the next.When the government talks about the importance of getting teens to explore their interests offline, this risks putting some interests ahead of others.Social mediais far from perfect, but young people deserve the ability to access news on the platforms they use – not blanket restrictions.Leo Puglisi is chief anchor and managing director at 6 News AustraliaExplore more on these topicsSocial media banOpinionSocial mediaAustralian politicsInstagramTikTokcommentShareReuse this content"

Solving that will help young people and their families tooMon 8 Dec 2025 08.10 ESTLast modified on Mon 8 Dec 2025 11.00 ESTShareTis the season to be jolly, unless you’re a teacher, in which case you are most likely a zombified wreck tenuously held together by caffeine and chocolate bars that aren’t evenmade of chocolateany more.In the popular imagination, teachers finish at 4pm and have “all those holidays”. Yet at this point in the year, most I know are barely functioning. Colds are battled for weeks on end as we stumble through brief lulls in the day as though dazed, unable to string thoughts together. The half terms are, yes, a perk, but they are also a necessary buffer against complete burnout.I am all too aware that teachers are taken as supreme moaners, forever griping about workloads while enjoying the sort of work-life balance other people envy. So I can only imagine the eye rolls and ocular strain brought on by recent pleas from the 4 Day Week Foundation that teachers in England and Walestrial a four-day week.It is true that when the holidays arrive, I am not engaged in the same desperate scramble to find childcare for my children, but the reality isn’t that we get to sit and twiddle our thumbs. According to the Trades Union Congress (TUC), two in five teachers work anextra 26 hours a weekfor free. It is the highest unpaid overtime of any UK profession. To make the numbers add up, that’s a pay packet £15,000 a year lighter than it should be. Or what Patrick Roach, the general secretary of the NASUWT teaching union, calls “daylight robbery”.I have worked as a teacher for nearly 20 years and, for the past few, I have worked a four-day week. My non-teaching day has given me space to think, plan, reset – the very activities we shunt to the margins despite knowing that focus and recovery are essential to productivity. The reduced teaching hours didn’t make an immediate difference, but over time working like this has become the only sustainable way for me to also be a mother, daughter, partner and functioning human being.It makes sense that a small shift like this would allow teaching to be more compatible with how we live today. The traditional teaching week remains tethered to a bygone era. Teachers no longer simply impart knowledge. We are “managers” of behaviour, provide pastoral support and safeguarding, and deal with special educational needs and disabilities (Send) administration. That is before mentioning the emotional labour of working with 30, often hormonal, young people all at once for hours a day. All this in the context of stripped services for young people and their families.No wonder, then, that in a 2023 study only59% of teachersexpected to remain in the profession over the following three years, down sharply from 74-77% before the pandemic. A pervading sense of regret permeates staffrooms.Longstanding problems with the state of teaching are reflected in poor levels of retention andrising ratesof staff sickness. Schools in England spent£1.25bn on supply teachersin 2022-23. If we continue to organise teachers’ working weeks the way we do, we’ll get the same results. It’s why the call for a four-day week in the profession isn’t acquiescing to needless complaining – it’s a necessary innovation.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Schools would open for five days, with teachers allocated one day each week as protected time to plan, mark and deal with the pastoral issues that each working day inevitably throws up. These tasks, impossible to complete adequately between 8am and 4pm, take chunks out of evenings and weekends. It is not about working less but working smarter, so teachers aren’t run ragged by endless tasks.At some point, the adults in the room must acknowledge the greater, and more expensive, risk is business as usual. Each year, thousands of teachers leave: 41,200 in England last year alone. The system is losing experience faster than it can replace it. We can’t continue to talk as though the status quo is the only and therefore best option. It is already failing and costing young people the stability they, their parents and teachers need.A four-day week is no magic bullet. It will not fix squeezed budgets or crumbling infrastructure. Young people will still be overwhelmed by an intensely packed, exams-driven curriculum. What it would do, however, is give exhausted staff room to breathe and plan so they can be better teachers. It is a bold idea that may just match the scale of the crisis.The real question is this: can we afford to continue as before?Lola Okolosie is an English teacher and writerExplore more on these topicsTeachers' workloadOpinionFour-day weekTeachingcommentShareReuse this content"

A rainbow of folded paper cranes. Boxes of donated goods for those in need. Hongkongers’ responses to the Tai Po fire disaster – in which at least 159 people have died and 31 are still unaccounted for – have, on the surface, resembled similar community expressions of solidarity last seen during the 2019 protests. But beneath the surface,Hong Kongcivil society is struggling to respond to this latest collective trauma in a city that has deeply changed in the past five years.The cauterisation of Hong Kong’s civil society that has occurred under Beijing’s national security crackdown has meant that the types of grassroots activism that would traditionally have occurred in response to such a tragedy – as they would in any other open society – are no longer possible.In the past,pro-democracy legislatorswould have grilled government officials in the legislative council: but in 2021 that changed when 47 pro-democracy politicians proposing to run in elections were charged with subversion, and later jailed. Only Beijing-approved “patriots” are now permitted to run for office, and all of Hong Kong’s pro-democracy political parties have since dissolved.Freewheeling independent media outlets, such asJimmy Lai’sApple Daily newspaper or online outlet Stand News, would have doggedly pursued investigative reporting to uncover corruption or mismanagement, and seek accountability for the fires. But those independent media outlets were forced to close, and their editorscharged with sedition.An array of civil society groups would have offered assistance. The Progressive Lawyers Group, for example, would have volunteered legal aid for victims and their families, and provided objective analysis on legal questions such as the difference between a statutory commission of inquiry and the toothless “independent committee” proposed by the Hong Kong government to investigate the disaster. But that group, and scores of other civil society groups, have either been forced to close by the authorities, or disbanded in fear.And Hong Kong’s creative community might have responded in works of art, film and literature. But artists have also been cowed. Those with a track record of activism or political activity are prevented from exhibiting. Theatre groups find their venue bookings abruptly cancelled. Films arecensoredsuch that the depiction – whether documentary or fictional – of any “sensitive” topic, including Hong Kong’s own protests broadcast widely in 2019, is effectively banned. A work of art on the Tai Po fires likeSteve McQueen’s haunting Grenfellcould not possibly be exhibited in today’s Hong Kong, and even making such a film would be considered an act of sedition.Hong Kong was once a city of lively, sometimes raucous, public debate; now those voices have fallen eerily silent. However, this does not prevent the authorities from being nervous that – as has been the pattern elsewhere inChinaand globally – the tragedy will become a focal point for anti-government sentiment.Reports of corruption or regulatory failures being a factor in the fires are one potential target for community anger. The extent to which this tragedy reveals a broken system, dominated by tycoon property developers, cronyism in the construction industry and a bureaucratic but ineffective government, remains to be seen.But it is a somewhat unlikely source of outrage that may become even more potent: bamboo. Initialreportsthat the bamboo scaffolding covering the buildings had contributed to the fire quicklydrew criticism. Subsequent investigations have come to focus on the flammable netting enveloping the scaffolding as well as Styrofoam boards used to cover the windows of the buildings while renovations were under way.However, in the meantime some in Hong Kong haveraised concernsthat the tragedy will be used as an excuse to phase out local bamboo scaffolding in favour of mainland-manufactured steel scaffolding. This is not merely a question of fire safety. Bamboo scaffolding is regarded as an example of Hong Kong’s unique cultural heritage, and as such is a deeply political matter. Issues of Hong Kong culture and identity havebeen at the coreof Hong Kong political protest movements, not just in 2019, but over the preceding decades. This makes bamboo capable of becoming a lightning-rod issue.The authorities’ immediate heavy-handed response to the tragedy betrays their concern: in the first week after the disaster, a university student distributing flyers demanding accountability for the fire wasdetained, as were a former pro-democracy local councillorproviding volunteer supportand a lawyer who had beencoordinating a press conferenceof civil society experts. The press conference was cancelled.A YouTuber who allegedly posted asinine and offensive – but not political – comments about the fire online was also arrested, marking the first time that Hong Kong’s national security laws have apparently been used to exercise mainland-style moral (as opposed to political) policing of online content.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The lines of accountability for local officials in cases of similar disasters in the mainland can be brutal and short. For example, just last year 55 officials, including the local mayor and party secretary wereremoved from their positionsor punished after a fire in a Jiangxi commercial building killed 39 people.So one bold reporter was speaking the minds of many of his fellow Hongkongers – and possibly many in the mainland as well – when he confronted chief executive John Lee in apress conferenceearlier this week with the question: “Can you tell us why you deserve to keep your job?” In any other Chinese city, heads would roll for the negligence and mismanagement that has caused so many deaths.However, from Beijing’s point of view, there is only one measure that will determine whether Lee will keep his job: will he be able to prevent any protests and snuff out any signs of dissent? By that measure, his performance so far has been faultless.Antony Dapiran is the author of two books on Hong Kong politics and protestExplore more on these topicsHong KongOpinionHong Kong apartment firesChinaAsia PacificcommentShareReuse this content"

Our chance of salvaging something from the mess it created is being undermined by those selling false hope – either that Brexit can work, or that it can be easily undone. For the 16,000 businesses that havenow given up trading with Europebecause of paperwork, prospects remain bleak unless the government stops offering a sticking plaster and starts major surgery on our future with Europe.Forgive pro-Europeans for thinking the momentum is now with us. Labour has been slow to say what it wants from the EU reset, and slower still to acknowledge the inevitable tradeoffs required. Until the summer, ministers promised to “make Brexit work” and endlessly repeated “red lines”. Yet in recent weeks, a major study has found that leaving the EUcost the UK 6-8% of GDP per capita; now the chancellorcalls the damage of Brexit“severe and long lasting”; the prime minister condemns the “wild promises” of the Leave campaign. Belatedly, a window of opportunity to change course may be opening.History shows that simply saying we want something from Europe doesn’t make it happen. The UK can be its own worst enemy – acting as if the challenge is in usdeciding our objectivesand the easy part is Europe agreeing. For the 27 other nations that are also part of this relationship, Britain’s confidence about who sets the agenda – from supporters and opponents of Brexit alike – is baffling.Anyone pro-European should resist talk of rejoining – not because Brexit was a good idea, but because to rejoin is, right now, an impossibility. Having dealt with our drama following the 2016 vote, asking the EU to indulge another referendum is like asking your neighbour to trust your next house party won’t result in more insurance claims. Even if the EU agreed to a rejoin process, it would take several years to decide the terms. Any other improvements to how we trade would be put on ice. For businesses desperate for respite, pursuing rejoin now would condemn them to another decade of struggling with paperwork mountains, with no guarantee a better deal will be secured.Those claiming we could “just”rejoin the customs unionor single market are little better at reading the mood of our neighbours. There’s no denying either would reduce the regulatory obstacles that have seen our goods exports to the EUfall by a fifth. But a customs union is an option not just with known drawbacks, such as giving up independent trade deals, but also outcomes we can’t predict, such as the EU’s new asking price on currency issues and movement of people. Rejoining the single market would mean taking on the anti-freedom of movement brigade and, given Britain’s divergence from the EU since Brexit, would be more complicated than many are willing to acknowledge.None of this is a reason not to aim high. Those independent trade deals are dwarfed by the effects of leaving the single market: therecent dealwith India ispredicted to addjust 0.13% per year to GDP. Europe can be more flexible than is often claimed – the Swiss aren’t part of a customs union but face far fewer barriers. But no option comes without costs, and the UK needs to be explicit in explaining why they are worth it. A customs union alone should not become our goal simply because it is seen as the least politically painful.Europe is perfectly capable of putting games before gains, too. Talks over UK participation in the EU’s €150bn Security Action for Europe (Safe) fund stalled when the commissiondemanded an exorbitant entry feeto show Brexit doesn’t bring benefits. Similar attempts to squeeze the UK can already be seen in proposed terms for the promised deals on food and animals – thesanitary and phytosanitary(SPS) agreement andemissions trading. Any hasty demands that make it look as if the UK thinks it deserves special treatment are likely to be knocked back.1. Measure the impactSo how can Labour square this circle? First, the government should commission a Brexit impact analysis, chaired by external experts, similar to thestrategic defence review. Previous governments stuck to the fantasy that Brexit could work; this government spent too long being shy to say it isn’t. At the budget, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR)declined to providefurther evidence on the economic effects of Brexit. That means, astonishingly, we still have no uncontested figures on the biggest single factor affecting growth.An impact analysis would put to bed that debate and those who still preachBrexitbenefits. It could also provide data to judge all future options, from the existing deal, to sector-specific deals on market access to – yes, membership of the customs union and the single market.2. Put everything on the tableSecond, the government should approach next year’s negotiations with Europe clear that it is looking for a deal offering “more for more”, with everything up for discussion – not just because we want better trade but because, in a world shaped by Donald Trump, Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping, Britain and Europe need each other more than ever. Geopolitical turmoil and the rise of far-right populists means that everything each side cares about should be on the table if the return is to be worth it.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Financial contributions to EU budgets must not be taboo if they bring net gain for the UK. Regulatory alignment is what UK businesses enmeshed in global supply chains prefer. Forget red lines – the Trump administration’s anti-Europeannational security strategy, and its threatenedNato withdrawal, should mean red alert.3. Trust parliamentThird, parliament should be brought into the discussion. Our future with Europe is yet to be debated formally under this government at all, let alone the possibilities of a revised deal. Brexiters and the “just rejoin” camp hide behind this lack of scrutiny to make their fantasies seem plausible. The government should not be frightened to take on either side, using the evidence in the review to show the impact of Brexit and what a new deal would deliver. Labour must confront those blocking the tradeoffs that would help British businesses by saying now they will put a mandate for that new relationship in the next manifesto.Nearly two-thirds of the publicnow see Brexit as more of a failurethan a success. But the obvious reason to overhaul our offer to Europe is that sticking with our current plans is irresponsible. This government inherited a growth emergency that is putting brutal pressure on public services and on people’s lives. Others profess simple answers for electoral gain. The right answers on Europe are not easy, nor quick – but they do exist. It’s not too late for Labour to make them.Stella Creasy is the chair of the Labour Movement for Europe and MP for WalthamstowExplore more on these topicsBrexitOpinionEuropean UnionForeign policyEuropeTrade policycommentShareReuse this content"

Despite being responsible for some of the films widely acknowledged to be the best of the century so far, including There Will Be Blood, The Master and Phantom Thread, the writer-director is yet to win an Oscar, Golden Globe or more than one Bafta (original screenplay for 2021’s Licorice Pizza).This year’s Golden Globe nominations suggest this is about to change, with his counterculture epicOne Battle After Anotherleading the pack of nominees with nine mentions on the shortlist, including for best comedy or musical, best director, best original screenplay, leading actor for Leonardo DiCaprio, leading actor for Chase Infiniti, supporting actress for Teyana Taylor and two chances to scoop supporting actor – for Sean Penn and Benicio del Toro. Jonny Greenwood’s score was also recognised.Golden Globes 2026: full list of nominationsRead moreAnderson, 55, has been here before, of course – he already has 11 Oscar nominations, one of the highest totals for someone who is yet to win – yet the season so far indicatesOne Battle After Another, in which DiCaprio plays a flailing freedom fighter facing off against Penn’s white supremacist, is the film to beat. Last week it won both the Gotham awards and New York Film Critics Circle, while on Sunday it also triumphed at the Los Angeles Film Critics Association awards.The film best placed to manage an upset seems set to beSinners, Ryan Coogler’s Mississippi-set ghost thriller which reunites him with Fruitvale Station and Creed star Michael B Jordan and was a major box office hit when it opened last spring. Sinners took seven Globe nominations, including best drama, director and actor. Coogler made history in 2018, when his Marvel film, Black Panther, took $1.3bn – the most grossed by a film directed by an African American man – and became the first superhero film to be nominated for best picture.View image in fullscreenRyan Coogler, Lupita Nyong’o and Michael B Jordan at a screening of Sinners in New York in December.Photograph: Theo Wargo/Getty ImagesNo Black director has yet won either the main Golden Globe or Academy Award for best director, although several – including Steve McQueen and Barry Jenkins – have directed films that have won best picture.Both Sinners and One Battle After Another are made by the studio Warner Bros, now the subject of aproposed buyout by Netflix. Although any deal is unlikely to go through by mid January, when the Globes take place, if it completes by 15 March it would bolster the streaming company’s chances of securing their first, and highly coveted, best picture win.Joachim Trier’sSentimental Valueperformed considerably better than expected, with eight nominations including best female actor for Renate Reinsve, and supporting female actor for both Inga Ibsdotter Lilleaas and Elle Fanning, supporting male actor for Stellan Skarsgård, plus recognition for the film’s original screenplay and direction.View image in fullscreenRenate Reinsve (left) and Inga Ibsdotter Lilleaas in Sentimental Value.Photograph: Kasper Tuxen/APIt is one of six contenders for best non-English language motion picture, including Iranian director Jafar Panahi’sIt Was Just an Accident. The Palme d’Or winner was put forward by France for the award as its director – whose experiences in prison inspired the film – is out of favour with his country’s government, whichlast week sentenced him to a further year in prison. His film is also up for best drama, best screenplay and best director.The healthy showing for both films, as well as for Park Chan-wook’sNo Other Choiceand Kleber Mendonça Filho’sThe Secret Agent– each of which picked up three nominations – are testament to both the Globes’ uptick in internationalism and a year in cinema that has been relatively soft for Hollywood critical hits while non-English language films have thrived.Wagner Moura’s nomination for best male actor in a drama, for The Secret Agent, makes him the first Brazilian to compete in the category, while actors such as Brendan Fraser (Rental Family) and Robert Pattinson (Die My Love) were excluded. Australian Joel Edgerton was among the nominees for the critically acclaimed Train Dreams.Richard Linklater and Emma Thompson are up for most surprising snub in the 2026 Golden Globe nominations | Peter BradshawRead moreOther significant snubs include Kathryn Bigelow, whose nuclear thrillerA House of Dynamitefailed to pick up a single nomination despite its rapturous reception at the Venice film festival; Alex Garland’sWarfare; and the highly acclaimed Taiwanese filmLeft-Handed Girl, written and directed by Tsou Shih-Ching, the longterm collaborator of Sean Baker, whose Anora swept the Oscars earlier this year.Sydney Sweeney’s committedperformance as boxer Christy Martinalso failed to translate to an expected nomination, while Bradley Cooper’s standup dramedyIs This Thing On?also failed to land any names in the hat.A number of hopefuls also only scored a single nomination for their stars, including Song Sung Blue (Kate Hudson), Springsteen biopic Deliver Me from Nowhere (Jeremy Allen White), Shaker story The Testament of Ann Lee (Amanda Seyfried), Luca Guadagnino’s After the Hunt (Julia Roberts) and Lynne Ramsay’s Die My Love (Jennifer Lawrence).There was also some confusion among pundits as to howSuperman(total takings: $616m) failed to land a cinematic and box office achievement mention, whileKPop Demon Hunters– released on Netflix with a brief singalong release – did.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFilm WeeklyFree newsletterTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

His photograph showed a youngster in the slums of the Gorbals wearing a dirtied dress. Smiling and holding a cane, she stands next to a young woman who is wearing a dress patterned with the faces of the Fab Four.View image in fullscreenAn enduring image … Beatle Girl by Joseph McKenzie.Images like McKenzie’s, and the street photography of Oscar Marzaroli, came to define Glasgow’s distinctive character – its Victorian tenements, grit and hardiness – charting industrial boom and subsequent bust, cycles of dereliction, regeneration and demolition. But what happened next? Featuring 80 photographs by artists of different generations,Still Glasgow, at the city’s Gallery of Modern Art (GoMA), captures its changes and complexities through the eyes of people who have been there since the 1940s.The show tracks music, art, activism and football – and local traditions, such as “Gobstopper”. This was immortalised inRoderick Buchanan’s 2000 video, in which two teens try to hold their breath for as long as possible while passing through the Clyde Tunnel. Here, some of the artists included in Still Glasgow explain what the city means to them.‘The lights blew the minute Franz Ferdinand started playing’Alan DimmickView image in fullscreen‘Down to earth, no airs and graces’ … Franz Ferdinand, The Captain’s Rest, Glasgow by Alan DimmickGlasgow’s music scene has always been lo-fi, DIY, small venues. It’s not fancy. It’s down to earth, no airs and graces. This was a secret Franz Ferdinand gig for an album that wasn’t out yet, in the basement of The Captain’s Rest, a tiny pub that’s been around a long time. Loads of people were outside trying to get in, but the room was full with 30 to 40 people. Within a minute of the gig starting, the electricity fused and you couldn’t see a thing. Eventually it got going again, though it blew several more times.‘I don’t know who they are. Their names were lost in a fire’David EustaceView image in fullscreen‘These strangers played an important part in my life’ … Man on Monocycle, Man with Stilts by David EustaceI wanted to record a time of great change in the city – and in the street musicians and performers I passed daily in the early 1990s. As a recent graduate with few funds, I came across an old, abandoned warehouse near the River Clyde and set about plastering and painting a wall that would serve as a studio backdrop. I would approach street entertainers who not only stopped what they were doing – ie, earning a living – but actually followed me to this dilapidated studio in a quiet part of the city.Unfortunately this was pre-computers, and the sitter’s names were noted on paper documents that were lost in a fire. Thankfully I can still remember some. The series of fibre-based silver prints in the exhibition were printed in my darkroom. These strangers, The Buskers, have played an important part in my life and, beyond simply photography and career, have brought opportunities I could never have imagined when I first sought the help of those strangers.‘I took 330 shots of the flats just before their demolition’Iseult TimmermansView image in fullscreen‘I decided to capture my experience’ … 10 Red Road Flats by Iseult Timmermans.I came to Glasgow in 1990. It was really weird. I felt I had come home. I’ve worked withStreet Level Photoworks, Glasgow’s first photography gallery, for 35 years. In 1990, I ran a project with Kosovan refugees, and on the last day of the six-week project, one of the girls was telling me about her experiences of the war under the safelight in the darkroom. Afterwards I drove her home to the Red Road flats. I had never heard of them. They were famously the tallest residential buildings in the UK when they were built: a vision of Brutalist utopian living, spectacular architecturally but alien, terrifying and disorienting.In those days, one block was a processing centre for asylum seekers coming to Glasgow. It was like a massive shabby hotel. I ended up running a community photography programme there, in a flat at 10 Red Road Court, for 10 years. It had a terrible reputation but I had nothing but great experiences. Coverage of the Red Road flats was always negative, so I decided to capture my experience of being there.I did it very literally: I photographed every floor, every landing, every view out, just before the demolition. Only half a dozen families were left by then. I made 330 images. No one else has captured the flats like that, with an inside view. I first exhibited some in 2014, just before the flats finally came down. The show didn’t just give a unique view of iconic architecture that is no longer there, it also touched on Glasgow’s history of housing developments and its welcoming of asylum seekers.‘I had to wear an alarm in case I got in trouble’Jane Evelyn AtwoodView image in fullscreen‘They were out of it by 10 in the morning’ … Man Standing in Entrance to Great Eastern Hotel by Jane Evelyn AtwoodWhen I took photographs at the Great Eastern Hotel for an assignment in 1994, I had to wear an alarm, in case I got into trouble with the guys living there. But nothing ever happened. The Great Eastern used to be a beautiful, luxurious hotel, then it became a flophouse where people were supposed to spend a couple of nights and move on – but many spent a long time there. I met some who had been there 20 years.It was completely run down. There had been a fire a long time before. They had swept the cinders up – but nothing more. It was a hostel for the homeless when I went, but the upstairs rooms weren’t really rooms: the partitions didn’t go up to the ceiling, so you could hear everything, and the doors had fallen off.I’m American originally and I couldn’t understand what anyone said. Although they were nice to me, the alcoholism was terrible. They drank so much they were out of it by 10 in the morning. They had been abandoned. There was no therapy of any kind. They were just left to their own devices. I went back a long time afterwards, when renovation was beginning, and all that was left was one pillar. It made me sad, wondering where all the people ended up.‘Being part of this scene was very cool’Joanne Tatham and Tom O’SullivanView image in fullscreen‘Each frame is made of found plywood’ … Easels by Joanne Tatham and Tom O’Sullivan.We lived and worked in Glasgow from the 1990s until 2011. At that time, the city was a place of real creativity – and change. We were interested in what was happening, but also the stories that emerged. This work, Easels, shows 15 artists in their studios. Each frame in the grid is made of found plywood.In the 1990s, narratives around gentrification in Glasgow didn’t align with other places. A lot of these grassroots spaces, such as Grey Wolf Studios and Wasps Studios, were set up in the 1970s and were well established. They were seen as part of civic culture. Although they weren’t glitzy, they were funded and were part of the ecology. In 2016, we took a number of trips back to make this work and had a great time. It’s a playful portrait capturing the feeling of a scene, but also the love of that scene and the mythology of it. Being part of it all was very cool.‘We asked people:what’s Glasgow to you?’Madelon HooykaasView image in fullscreenA Jaguar and a horse-and-cart shot by Madelon Hooykaas.Photograph: Stansfield/ HooykaasIn 1975, Third Eye Gallery, now the CCA, acquired a Portapak, the first portable video recording device, and they invited the late Scottish artist Elsa Stansfield and I to make a work with it. We created a studio people could come to, recording their responses to questions along the lines of: “What’s Glasgow to you?” People got involved. They could walk in and feel heard. It was the first time something like that had been done inScotland. The video has now been lost, but the photographs connected to it survive.‘This is Charlie Prodger before she won the Turner’Matthew Arthur WilliamsView image in fullscreen‘I want people to feel comfortable’ … Charlie Prodger by Matthew Arthur Williams.I’ve been in Glasgow for 12 years. It’s become home and I have no intentions of moving. I have been taking portraits of artists for GoMA for six years. I usually do the portrait at their studio or home. I want people to feel comfortable with how they’re represented.My work at GoMA is of the artist Charlie Prodger, before she won the Turner prize in 2018. It’s encouraging when you see friends and peers doing so well. It was a freezing day but sunny and bright, and we were in her flat. Charlie and I have worked together and helped each other. Glasgow has a tight-knit community of artists who are always working together – we survive by sharing resources and making space for each other. The art community is thriving here because of that. The situation in Glasgow is different to other places: funding is difficult, there’s a lack of money in the arts, conditions are fraught, so you have to make something out of nothing.‘My shot is a reminder of fun times with my family’Khansa AslamView image in fullscreenChildren Playing on Roundabout in Maxwell Park by Eric Watt.Photograph: Eric Watt/© Glasgow Life Museums collectionIn May 2023, some of us from the Glendale Women’s Cafe went to see Coming Into View, an exhibition of Eric Watt’s photographs of Glasgow. Inspired, we started working with photographer Robin Mitchell. One of Eric’s photographs was taken in Maxwell Park in the 1970s. I was born and raised around there in the 1980s and 90s.View image in fullscreen‘My Asian roots are an important part of who I am’ … Family on the Roundabout by Khansa Aslam.In my photograph of Maxwell Park, I wanted to capture the place’s changes and similarities. My photo is a reminder of the fun times my family and I have spent there and, I hope, one day my grandkids will too. My Asian roots are an important part of who I am. I value how generations of people from many backgrounds have made Glasgow their home. My children grew up here and they proudly call this city home too.‘Things perked up in the 1980s as pride in the city grew’Keith InghamView image in fullscreen‘1970s weren’t good, there were strikes and unemployment’ … Untitled by Keith Ingham.I moved to Glasgow 50 years ago but I’m still identified as English. It’s that sort of place. I was living in the West End and would go to the public library frequently to change my book – a nice purpose-built Victorian building. One Saturday, I walked in and it was full of amazing photographs – what became known as the social documentary genre – of the local area: Partick, near the River Clyde, a working-class area where the shipbuilding industry used to be. I got in touch with the Partick Camera Club, which had created the exhibition. I was invited to do a project about the demolition and rejuvenation of the East End. My shots were first shown at The People’s Palace and seen by thousands.That’s when I started to get serious about photography. I’ve never made any money from it, but I have enthusiasm and people know about me. The 1970s weren’t good – the shipyards closed, there were strikes and unemployment, a lot of anger and anxiety. It perked up in the 1980s, and there began to be pride in the city and being Glaswegian. There was a huge garden festival and, in 1990, Glasgow was European City of Culture, which was a huge thing and generated an international reputation. It’s changed enormously.Still Glasgowis at GoMA until 13 June 2027Explore more on these topicsPhotographyGlasgowScotlandfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But instead he reached into his car and took out the sawn-off shotgun you see in the movie’Interviews byDave SimpsonMon 8 Dec 2025 10.02 ESTLast modified on Mon 8 Dec 2025 13.26 ESTShareFrederick Brathwaite AKA Fab 5 Freddy, concept, actor, musical directorI was part of the New York graffiti artists the Fabulous 5, who were primarily known for painting whole subway cars on the Lexington Avenue line. Lee Quiñones was the group’s Michelangelo. I’d been running withJean-Michel Basquiatand wanted totake graffiti art into art spaces. I thought that an underground independent film could tell our story in the way we wanted.At an art show in Times Square I met Charlie Ahearn, who’d made an underground kung fu film, The Deadly Art of Survival, on Super 8. Charlie loved the movie idea and I explained that we could tell the story of an emerging new culture: graffiti art, breakdancing and rap. We wanted a movie with a narrative but a documentary feel, so alongside real rappers from the Bronx we had graffiti artists playing themselves, but as characters. Lee became Zoro, a kind of masked superhero. We wantedPhase 2– a giant of a graffiti writer who was making flyers for hip-hop parties – to represent the connection between graffiti art and hip-hop. However, he preferred to stay in the shadows. Charlie said: “Fred, you can do it!” So I became an actor, basing Phade, the club promoter, on Phase 2.Charlie insisted we make our own music. I knewBlondie’s Chris Stein and Debbie Harrybecause they’d bought art from me as well as Jean-Michel, so Charlie, Chris and I hooked up to do the score. Everybody said that Patti Astor, who plays Virginia the reporter, looked like Debbie Harry, and Blondie let us usetheir song Pretty Babyfor Virginia’s big entrance. Blondie were very supportive. When I heard Debbie sing “Fab 5 Freddy told me everybody’s fly” inRaptureI thought: “That’s me!”Although the Sugarhill Gang’s Rapper’s Delight was a big hit, most rappers weren’t making records yet. They’d just get on the mic for ages, so we edited the music scenes but kept their meaning. The film captures what was a very underground culture in a few ghetto neighbourhoods: the Bronx, Queens andBrooklyn. I could never have imagined it would become this huge global thing.Charlie Ahearn, writer, director, producerOne of Lee’s murals had appeared in The DeadlyArtof Survival, which I made for $1,000. I’d been trying to contact him but he was elusive. I think he thought I was a cop, or would lead him into situations where he’d be arrested. So when I was approached by Fab 5 Freddy, who’d seen my kung fu film and knew Lee, it was perfect.I went to a hip-hop jam in the Bronx with 10,000 kids and a gun went off. I thought we should have that in the movieI wanted to make a movie that would play in theatres to teenagers: a romance about a subway graffiti outlaw character being chased by the police.Lady Pink[artist Sandra Fabara] was hanging out with all these young wannabe graffiti artists. I took one look at her and thought: that’s the character who we named Rose “Lady Bug”. I approached Channel 4 in London and ZDF in Germany, sending each an envelope with a Xerox of a subway train, a cassette of a hip-hop club and a sheet outlining the idea. Each sent me $25,000, my only source of funding.View image in fullscreenCharlie Ahearn directing Wild Style.Photograph: TCD/Prod.DB/AlamyWhen I went to a hip-hop jam in the Bronx with 10,000 kids, a gun went off and I thought we should do something like that in the movie. I saw some guys leaning against a wall and asked them to be in a stick-up scene. I handed one a starting pistol but he said, “That’s a pussy gun,” reached into his car and took out the sawn-off shotgun you see in the film.When I approached [rapper] Busy Bee Starski at a jam he was smoking a joint, led me on stage and said without taking a breath: “Here’s Charlie Ahearn. He’s my movie producer.”Eventually I metGrandmaster Flash, who was already a star. I shot an amphitheatre scene with him performing with his group, the Furious Five, but I couldn’t use it because the sound was distorted. I had to restage the entire concert without Flash, who was away touring so couldn’t appear again – so his live show never made the film. Shit happens.When Wild Style opened in Times Square I paid some kids $25 each to distribute flyers in their schools, so at the first screenings they queued around the block. When it was shown in Japan, they thought it was a science fiction movie and that I’d invented this new culture. It’s been called the greatest hip-hop film ever made. It was certainly the first.Wild Style is available to stream on the Arrow Video Channel and to own on 4K UHD and Blu-rayExplore more on these topicsFilmHip-hopStreet artArtNew YorkSocial historyBrooklynfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But his music is quite different: a slippery layer cake of samples, multitudinous keys and lo-fi pop production, with Brown singing of a world where “the ebb and flow isn’t ebbing right”, be it in love or civic life. There is still room for an instant-classic R&B ballad though, in Tossed Away.Ben Beaumont-Thomas49Rochelle Jordan – Through the WallEverything isjust soon the British Canadian producer’s sixth album: expensively plush deep house suggesting club lights low, gleaming mirrors, potent looks igniting across the dancefloor. As much as the cold beat and ballroom flow of Ladida or the slapping “body, body, body” incantations of On 2 Something suggest a steadfast commitment to abandon, Jordan maintains impeccable poise and control throughout, whether in diva mode on Words 2 Say, breaking hearts on Bite the Bait, standing up for her needs on Doing It Too (“I’m not too much / You just give too little”) or patiently waiting for a frustrated lover to see the light on Ladida. Commanding, wise and committed to atmospheric excellence, party hosts don’t come better.Laura Snapes48Jerskin Fendrix– Once Upon a Time … in ShropshireView image in fullscreenHarebrained prog cabaret … Jerskin Fendrix.Photograph: Tim GuttJerskin Fendrix’s high-profile scores for the last three Yorgos Lanthimos films can’t really help prime you for the Midlands composer’s eccentrically beautiful second album, which pairs pristine musical theatre with the harebrained prog cabaret of Faith No More and (particularly) the under-sung Morphine. At first, Once Upon a Time … casts the rural bliss of growing up in 00s Shropshire in a golden light, a haven of getting ratted on Baileys and listening to Kanye on a farm, then having a lovely hungover group breakfast in someone’s kitchen. But the unexpected deaths he has experienced in recent years intrude to spoil paradise, eliciting feverish, absurdist expressions of grief – Jerskin Fendrix Freestyle is a bravura wig-out – and fathomless devastation from his camp, craggy voice. It demands a full theatrical production.LS47Clipping– Dead Channel SkyClipping frontman Daveed Diggs is best known for being in the original cast of Hamilton, and for all that this album is filled with noisy industrial rap, you can easily imagine it being successfully adapted for the Broadway stage. Dead Channel Sky is set in a cyberpunk dystopia not dissimilar to the scorched-sun “real world” of the Matrix, humming with janky tech and populated with fascists and freaky hedonists. Producers William Hutson and Jonathan Snipes render it in acid squiggles and revving breakbeats, while Diggs delivers his mutoid poetry like a prophet jacked up on some amphetamine he’s synthesised in a backstreet lab.BBTTell us your favourite albums of 2025Read more46The Tubs – Cotton CrownIn different hands,the Tubs’ second album might be a crushing listen, and understandably so. In 2014, frontman Owen Williams’ mother, the songwriter and author Charlotte Greig,died by suicide. Grief, as these songs detail, made him a rubbish boyfriend. But Cotton Crown is often funny and ardent, and especially self-aware about how new love might feel like a life raft to a depressed mind ill-equipped to reciprocate: “Know it’s all in my brain / Caught in the middle of loving you and being insane,” Williams sings on Fair Enough. His striking voice, somewhere between Richard Thompson and Bob Mould, bolts through the band’s joyful jangle-pop. Clear students of the form, they’re virtuosos with zero patience for perfection, their riffs hurtling and plundering like seagulls going at a spilled catch as they vigorously rough you up with profundity.LS45Smerz – Big City LifeView image in fullscreenAn album of stilted beauty … Smerz.Photograph: Alva Le FebvreCatharina Stoltenberg and Henriette Motzfeldt feel like the pop girlies of the incredibly prolific and off-kilterCopenhagen Rhythmic Music Conservatory scene, making music that’s more outward-facing and arch than some of their insular and traditional (and equally great) classmates. Their second album lurches between throwing yourself at life – “you’re a girl in the city and you shouldn’t think twice”, they chant in deadpan harmony on Roll the Dice – and actually thinking twice quite a lot in existential spirals about purpose and desire. The dissonance between confidence and anxiety comes through in the album’s stilted beauty: one minute, their whorls of prepared piano carry you along like clouds amid perfectly turned pop-R&B and balladry; then they stab and stutter, like cracks in the pavement destined to trap your heels. In 2023, K-pop’s brightest hopes NewJeans hired them as co-writers: more pop bearing their imprint can only be a good thing.LS44Sabrina Carpenter – Man’s Best FriendReleased almost exactly a year after her superstar-minting breakthrough Short n’ Sweet, and using a palette of soft rock, 80s pop, light disco and yearning country melodies, Carpenter added rich colour to one of pop’s most distinctive self-portraits. Her blatant sexuality is offset by an ironising sense of camp and a deep streak of cynicism, as she wonders whether to wrap her little finger round a series of hot but useless men. But whether dialling her exes while hopped up on “go-go juice” or being toxic for the sport of it (“you think that I’m gonna fuck with your head / well, you’re absolutely right”), Carpenter knows she’s part of the problem. Her fake helplessness at her own worst impulses is just one part of a formidable screwball comedy arsenal – she’s a Rosalind Russell for the dating app era.BBT43Jennifer Walton – DaughtersView image in fullscreenBolt from the blue … Jennifer Walton.Photograph: Liam CosfordThis Sunderland producer’s previous work included one EP of power electronics, one of antic club tracks, collabs with Aya and 96 Back as Microplastics, gigging with Kero Kero Bonito and a smattering of other credits. So her staggering, fully formed songwriterly debut was a total bolt from the blue. A swarming orchestral epic with shades of Julia Holter and Phil Elverum, it addressed her grief for her late father in serenely surrealist images – hitting a deer with a car in the middle of the night – and the painfully mundane realism of sitting in hospital corridors together. The standout Miss America combined both to stunning effect, a numbed incantation of everything Walton had seen on the US trip where she learned of her father’s diagnosis, the familiar now remade horribly mythic.LS42Erika de Casier– LifetimeErika de Casier’s fourth album updates the Y2K R&B template that fought for body-to-body sensuality in the face of rising digital creep. The old-school dial tones that pierce Lifetime’s rapt, liquid atmosphere work both as Janet homage and ironic sigh at how good those forebears had it when emotional warfare could only be conducted via pager: “Took a screenshot so / I could look at your pretty face all the time now / Without a sign that I’m online,” de Casier sings on earworm Delusional, a low-slung anthem for contemporary dating anxiety. “Hit midnight / Not even a text to hold me warm,” she rues on The Chase. That’s one of the most inviting things about Lifetime: its seductively cool surfaces conceal de Casier frantically kicking her feet below the surface, just like the rest of us.LS41Danny Brown – StardustThe Detroit rapper’s first post-rehab record totally disprovedhis fearsthat sobriety makes artists boring. On Stardust, Brown is still hard-wired with cartoonish verve, coupled with a genuinely touching sense of gratitude: “Sleeping real good at night ’cos I’m proud of myself,” he raps on Book of Daniel. While you probably wouldn’t describe someone who ponders “going bonkers and knocking out your chompers” as a wise elder, his hunger for life, opportunity and unmediated sensation blares through in how evidently gagged he is to centre younger producers from the digicore and hyperpop undergrounds: his unruly kids 8485, Jane Remover, Underscores, Frost Children and more make Stardust trip with glitch, rave, squealing riffs and overdriven noise. The rare record that makes you want to riot and shed a smiling single tear emoji.LS40-31 coming soonCome back tomorrow for the next 10 albums in the countdown!"

Timed to ruin holidays like a round of end-of-year layoffs, the streaming giantannounced plansto buy Warner Bros, a movie and television studio with a full-century legacy. It’s possible that the acquisition won’t actually go through – and if it does, it won’t be for at least a year. But the news still looms over year-end awards and list-making, and it’s going to take more than a jingle-bell heist to steal back any holiday cheer for the entertainment industry, much less halt the march of corporate consolidation and monopolization. Even more depressing: the entity that seems most able to take action against this is … another attempted consolidation. Paramount haslaunched a bidfor a hostile takeover of Warner Bros Discovery, which would bring two big studios under one extremely Trump-friendly umbrella. This would almost certainly further cull the number of wide-release movies released each year.The end of big-screen cinema? What Netflix hopes to achieve by buying Warner Bros | Andrew PulverRead moreDepression might not seem like a rational response, especially for anyone who doesn’t actually work in said industry. (There are plenty of reasons that various unions aremaking their opposition to either sale known.) Yet the news last week had hundreds of film fans posting eulogies and defenses not just of Warner Bros as a studio – which on its own includes a vast history encompassing classics like Casablanca, The Adventures of Robin Hood, The Departed, Bonnie and Clyde, The Searchers and The Matrix, among hundreds – but the very fabric of theatrical moviegoing.It’s an institution that many of us took for granted for years. The venues might change, with single-screen palaces and drive-ins giving way to mall theaters and multiplexes, but it was easy to assume that movie theaters would always be around in some form or another. Now some habitual moviegoers, still shaken up by the extended closure of many theaters during the worst of the Covid-19 pandemic and a Netflix-led cultural shift toward watching everything on the couch, periodically enter a panic over whether theaters as we know them will still exist in 10 or 20 years.They probably will – at least in big cities, where a variety of mainstream new releases, arthouse runs and rep screenings sustain a healthy variety of exhibition options. (Manhattan alone has more than two-dozen theaters.) But beyond the many areas where a thriving movie house is not a given, it increasingly feels like the ability of movie theaters and studios to weather various storms may not actually matter in the face of such corporate flexes.View image in fullscreenMichael B Jordan in Sinners.Photograph: Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc./PAWhat’s dispiriting about the Netflix news is how clearly it indicates how little a studio’s actual success matters in terms of sustaining itself – because on those terms,Warner Broshad a spectacular year in 2025. They captured the youth audience with A Minecraft Movie, posted huge grosses for original and auteur-driven genre hybrids Sinners and Weapons, revitalized their superhero franchise with Superman, maintained two storied horror series with new Final Destination and Conjuring sequels, positioned One Battle After Another for a possible Oscar run (and gave Paul Thomas Anderson his most-seen movie yet), and even had a hand in an old-fashioned, near-literal star vehicle by distributing Apple’s F1 movie with Brad Pitt. And while previous years saw some costly flops, they’re only a few years out from Barbie becoming their biggest movie ever. Not to get corny about something that is, after all, another mega-corporation of its own, but between Barbie, Dune, Minecraft, Superman, One Battle After Another and various movies where King Kong fights Godzilla, chances are most casual moviegoers had at least one great time a Warner Bros movie sometime in the last couple of years.Warner Bros Disaster? Netflix inks deal for troubled Hollywood giantRead moreIn the hands of the Warner Bros Discovery CEO, David Zaslav, though, these hits aren’t evidence of how the movie business can flourish. They’re valued insofar as they can help goose the possibility of a sale. On the other side of that transaction, Netflix probably isn’t buying Warner Bros because they see a valuable library of older films and a ready-made pipeline to major theatrical releases. In a movie-centric utopia, Netflix could complement the Warner Bros slate with lower-budget romcoms, adult-driven thrillers and teen movies that big studios often ignore, as well as a regular supply of the streamer’s sideline in artistic passion projects from the likes of Martin Scorsese, Spike Lee, Noah Baumbach and David Fincher. (Maybe auteurs like Scorsese and Lee wouldn’t be scared off after a single movie, knowing that Warner Bros could actually put their films in theaters.) Netflix could also bring all manner of classic cinema into viewers’ homes.But judging by how many pre-1990 titles on Netflix at any given time and the awards-qualifying theatrical releases it begrudgingly gives its more prestigious projects, a rich catalog and major theatrical releases are elements of the film industry and its history that the company vaguely disdains. Netflix is buying Warner Bros mostly to eliminate the competition ofHBOMax – and maybe, down the road, the broader competition of people occasionally leaving their homes for entertainment.View image in fullscreenDaniel Radcliffe in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/AlamyOh, and the IP. Netflix subscribers received a so-sad-it’s-funny email from the company about the impending purchase, in which they crowed about “bringing some of the world’s most beloved franchises like Harry Potter, Friends, The Big Bang Theory, Casablanca, Game of Thrones and the DC Universe together with Stranger Things, Wednesday, Squid Game, Bridgerton and KPop Demon Hunters.” It’s telling that the token Warner movie that they algorithmed into this announcement is Casablanca, perhaps the most “name a movie” movie of all time (at least in the pre-1970 division), which they immediately, bafflingly, and terrifyingly describe as a “franchise”. (For that matter, how is Friends a franchise? That show has yielded one reunion special and a bunch of cheesy in-person pop-ups in the 20 years since it left the air.)On its own, this is just corporate insensitivity and bumbling – neither particularly endemic to 2025 in particular. And yes, the movie-lover’s grandstanding over the sanctity of the theatrical experience can feel a little embarrassing. Suddenly we’re all Nicole Kidman, reading from a series of quasi-PSAs on behalf of multiplexes that forget to turn the lights down and don’t employ projectionists who can fix technical issues. Divorced from that grandiosity, though, moviegoing can be a simple pleasure, a relatively affordable escape that some companies seem hellbent on treating like a productivity problem, begging to be solved. Wouldn’t you save energy by staying home? Wouldn’t you feel like you’re saving money if you agree to give us 20 bucks a month in perpetuity for whatever stuff we can scrounge up for our homepage? Doesn’t the decision to watch a particular movie take up valuable brainpower we could colonize with an algorithm? Even if Paramount doesn’t succeed in wresting Warner away from Netflix, a hostile takeover has already begun. Tech weirdos want control of our art and leisure. We shouldn’t cede it to them.Explore more on these topicsWarner BrosNetflixFilm industryUS televisionHBOTelevisionUS television industrycommentShareReuse this content"

Finishing Cover-Up, a film about his astonishing life and countless scoops, was never going to be easyXan BrooksMon 8 Dec 2025 00.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 8 Dec 2025 20.04 ESTShareOne morning last month, Seymour Hersh set off to buy a newspaper. The reporter walked for 30 minutes, covered six blocks of his neighbourhood, Georgetown in Washington DC, and didn’t see a single sign of life. No newsstands on street corners selling the glossies and the dailies. No self-service kiosk where you can slide in a dollar and pull out a paper. “Finally, I found a drugstore that had two copies of theNew York Timesin the back,” Hersh recalls. He bought one for himself. He can’t help but wonder whether anybody bought the second.Hersh was born in Chicago in 1937, the year the Hindenburg airship blew up and the aviator Amelia Earhart disappeared over the Pacific. That makes him a man of hot metal, the media’s ancient mariner, with metaphorical newsprint on his fingers and a cuttings file that reads like an index of American misadventure. Hersh has been a staff writer at the New York Times and the New Yorker. He’s broken stories on Vietnam, Watergate, Gaza and Ukraine. But the free press is in crisis, newspapers are in flux and investigative journalism may be facing a deadline of its own. “I don’t think I could do now what I did 30, 40, 50 years ago,” says the now 88-year-old. “The outlets aren’t there. The money’s not there. So I don’t know where we all are right now.”Laura, the director, would ask me, ‘And how did you feel?’ That’s not a guy’s questionCover-Up, a new documentary from Laura Poitras and Mark Obenhaus, at least reminds us where he’s been, rewinding the clock to chart Hersh’s galvanic, obstreperous course through American journalism. It’s a film that gives us the newsman’s greatest hits, with particular focus on his exposés of the 1968 My Lai massacre of unarmed South Vietnamese civilians by US army soldiers, and the 2004 Abu Ghraib prison torture scandal, while also acknowledging his occasional missteps and contentious reliance on unnamed single sources.View image in fullscreen‘His anger was mostly directed at me’ … Oscar-winning documentary-maker Laura Poitras.Photograph: Linda Nylind/The GuardianAlong the way, it whips up a vivid sketch of Hersh himself: a prickly hothead who makes enemies in the editorial office and the Oval Office alike. “This Seymour Hersh is a son of a bitch, probably a communist agent,” President Nixon tells Kissinger on an unearthed White House tape. “But,” he adds grudgingly, “he’s usually right.”Initially, Hersh had no interest in participating in the documentary. He says Poitras chased him for years. He’s still not sure what made him change his mind. Hersh had collaborated with Obenhaus several times in the past. But Poitras was a different kind of director and came at him from disconcerting new angles. “Mark and I, when we interview people, we just ask them what happened. Whereas Laura would ask me, ‘And how did you feel?’” He snorts at the memory. “That’s not a guy’s question. That’s more psychoanalytical.”The shoot was a chore and his patience ran short. Hersh hated letting cameras snoop around his office, which was heaped with legal notepads and Rolodexes. He guarded his list of contacts like a dragon guards its treasure. It was only a matter of time before his mistrust boiled over and he threatened to quit the film altogether.Poitras won an Oscar for Citizenfour, her documentary on the NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden, whose revelations were published in the Guardian. Her previous picture,All the Beauty and the Bloodshed, about the artist and activist Nan Goldin, won the Venice Golden Lion. So she’s used to working with volatile subjects to the point where she relishes the drama they bring. Her main thought, when Hersh briefly bailed on the project, was a sense of relief that he had considerately done so on-camera.View image in fullscreenFrontline … an image from Cover-Up of US troopsin Vietnam.Photograph: Ron Haeberle/Courtesy of Netflix“Sy has a pattern of quitting,” Poitras tells me. “He quit the New York Times, for instance. So we knew it wasn’t inconceivable that he would quit the movie. It could well have happened. But I thought he was invested, I thought we’d get through it. His anger was mostly directed at me. We hit a small bump. He quit the movie. But 24 hours later he was back.”The film is about Hersh but it’s also about journalism. It shows the news media’s in-built contradictions and its flawed business model. Cover-Up suggests that the best investigative reporters are natural outsiders who rarely last long inside risk-averse institutions. Editors and management might claim they want good stories, but in practice they fear them, because scoops tend to cause trouble and involve a big fight. Tellingly, the film includes an archive clip of Hersh speaking on stage in the 1970s. He says: “What we have here in America is not so much censorship as self-censorship by the press.”If that was true then, Poitras says, it’s doubly so today. She’s alarmed not just by Trump’s authoritarian push to stifle a free press but by the alacrity with which several media giants have already rolled over. Two major networks – ABC and CBS – recently agreed to settlements with Trump instead of fighting the case out in court. The Washington Post’s owner, Jeff Bezos, has ordered the paper to focus less on politics and more on promoting “personal liberties and free markets”.The situation is parlous, Poitras says. “What we’re seeing in the US is the preemptive capitulation of institutions to avoid a legal battle they would have won. That’s shameful. I don’t know how they explain that to themselves. It’s the worst precedent you can possibly set.” She shakes her head. “If institutions aren’t willing to back aggressive reporting, it’s dangerous. We all suffer.”View image in fullscreenShocked by the crowd’s response … Poitras and Hersh at the Venice film festival in August.Photograph: Yara Nardi/ReutersTimes are tough, agrees Obenhaus, Cover-Up’s co-director. The first amendment is under daily siege; it’s the closest to McCarthyism, the era of repression and persecution in the 1950s, that he has witnessed in his lifetime. Throw in the wider issue of an increasingly atomised media landscape and it might amount to the perfect storm.“There are no gatekeepers on information any more,” says Obenhaus. “The so-called legacy media is so dispersed. And without that centre – that base – it’s hard for good journalism to break through, which means people are increasingly relying on unreliable sources. It troubles me tremendously that the Sy Hersh of today might be writing on Substack or some other platform – and you’d never even hear of them unless the algorithm connected you to their work.”As it happens,Hersh does write on Substack. The platform suits him because he has a large dedicated readership that will happily pay for his work; also because it allows him to cover the stories he wants, free from editorial interference. “Substack is self-publishing,” Hersh explains. “So it’s a subculture. It works financially. It’s a living, I’m not knocking it. But it’s not like writing for the New York Times.” He doesn’t miss the office politics, the corporate culture and what he sees as the cowardice and compliance of senior editors. What he misses, though, is the thrill of performing on the big stage.If Cover-Up shows us anything, it’s that the journalist’s role has always been sisyphean. It’s a constant uphill struggle in which every triumph risks being immediately rolled back. Hersh’s career-making exposé of the My Lai massacre, for instance, dismantled the US army’s official version of events and helped swing public opinion against the war in Vietnam. But it led to the conviction of only one out of the 26 soldiers involved,Lieutenant William Calley, whose prison sentence was later commuted by Nixon.One bonus of a six-decade career is that it gives Hersh a sense of perspective. Investigative reporting is usually thankless and frequently fruitless, he knows. But it still speaks truth to power and remains a vital engine of social change. “The principle of journalism is incredible,” he says. “Just imagine how the world would have been if we didn’t have the journalism we’ve had, and still have today. I don’t like what’s going on in the US. I don’t like the kowtowing to Trump. But there’s still the Wall Street Journal. The New York Times is still a good newspaper. The LA Times used to be but it’s now owned by a Trumpist.” He is referring to Patrick Soon-Shiong. “But journalism matters,” he adds, collecting himself. “It’s necessary.”Cover-Up review – Laura Poitras’s Seymour Hersh documentary is a thrilling ode to journalismRead moreIn September, Hersh attended the Cover-Up premiere at the Venice film festival. The audience response was so overwhelming, Poitras says, that it moved the newsman to tears. “He’s always been this lone-wolf troublemaker,” she explains. “So maybe he’s not used to being recognised and celebrated. I don’t think he was prepared for it. He was very emotional. He was crying.”Hersh tells a different story. He claims he was shocked by the crowd’s response. The audience didn’t get the film’s humour, he adds, didn’t laugh at the right moments, then applauded for an unseemly amount of time at the end. “I was embarrassed by that,” he says. “I know they like to measure the length of the applause at these festivals, but come on, enough. I was trying to stop it.”I like the image of Hersh standing in the aisle and signalling for people to shut up. It feels neatly on-brand for this most awkward of customers: a thorn in the side of every great institution – an unashamed party-pooper, even at his own party.Cover-Up is in UK and Irish cinemas from 5 December, and on Netflix from 26 December.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsLaura PoitrasNew York TimesNewspapersUS press and publishingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Perhaps it was creator Jacob Tierney’sterse response to questions of his leading actors’ sexualitieswhile on a recent promotional tour. Or that the show is based on a series of concupiscent novels by Canadian writer Rachel Reid that centre hockey (!), and which ride the current trend for “hate-to-love” romance driving the kids crazy. Actually, it’s probably just all the hot gay sex.Because Heated Rivalry does get heated. One minute aloof Russian player Ilya Rozanov (Connor Storrie) is making eyes at meek local champion Shane Hollander (Hudson Williams), the next they’re wanking in the shower together. Then getting blowjobs in classy hotel suites. Pretty soon, the boys are going at it hammer and tongs – broken at regular intervals by months-long ellipses, waiting for the hockey circuit to bring them back into each others’ arms. This is also convenient for sexual tension, which would otherwise have to be developed through character and dialogue.So much heat. If only they had somewhere they could cool down.Actually, for a show ostensibly about ice hockey – a sport that lends itself to rousing storytelling, asInside Out 2beautifully demonstrated – there’s curiously little of it on display here. Tierney seems more interested in the ambivalent thrill of down-low fucking than any exploration of masculinity or homoeroticism in sport. The guys don’t even use their uniforms when having sex – which I find highly improbable.The sex scenes aren’t quite as explicit as the pearl-clutching critics might have you believe, although they seem to provide a valuable cardio workout to augment the boys’ training (they make the sweaty scenes from Challengers look like dry humping). The problem is the actors’ ludicrously sculpted bodies resemble store mannequins dipped in vats of lube, and the rigorous on-set intimacy coordinators seem to have sucked all the spontaneity from the action, so the effect has the strange waxiness you get in a Bret Easton Ellis novel without his concomitant satirical savagery. It brings to mind the puppets fucking in Team America: World Police.When they’re not boning each other senseless, Rozanov and Hollander make for dreary, monosyllabic company – and their stormy sex life hardly constitutes “hate-to-love” romance, given they’re in the sack within the opening 10 minutes and actively encourage each other’s careers.View image in fullscreen‘When they’re not boning each other senseless, Rozanov and Hollander make for dreary, monosyllabic company.’Photograph: HBO MaxPerhaps in acknowledgment of this lack of dramatic material, the third episode ignores the central couple altogether to focus on a teammate, fellow closeted gay Scott Hunter (François Arnaud) and his dalliance with local barista Kip (Robbie GK). Yes, every single professional ice hockey player in the world is secretly, torturously gay (but also totally up for it).The Outsiders: why Francis Ford Coppola’s coming-of-age drama is secretly gayRead moreIf only this love affair were more interesting than the previous one, or at least had some thematic consequence. Alas, Scott and Kip (Skip?) are saddled with a tedious, emotionally remote story arc and dialogue so banal (“I want you more than I’ve ever wanted anything in a long time”), the whole episode starts to feel like an unfortunate detour, skippable.Performances are generally wooden, which might suit the taciturn nature of professional sportspeople but creates a drag on pace and mood. The key exception is Storrie as the mercurial Russian – who steals the third episode with 20 seconds of screen time – bursting with charisma, machismo and brawn, but also something sad and wounded. He’s too good for the material, and could use a stronger sparring partner, who is easily mistaken for his hockey stick.View image in fullscreen‘He’s too good for the material’ …  Connor Storrie as Ilya Rozanov.Photograph: Sabrina Lantos/HBO MaxWe’re only halfway through, but I already get a sinking feeling about Heated Rivalry. It comes out of a wave of gay-themed romcom material – fromHeartstoppertoRed, White and Royal Blue– that seems content to exploit gay culture without understanding it in a meaningful way. There is a weird kind of fetish in these works that desexes gay men just enough to make them palatable, like pets for young women (and it’s largely young women reading these books and driving sales).Heated Rivalry might have raunchier sex than its rivals – not difficult in Heartstopper’s case, where no one has even heard of a blowjob – but it trades in the same bullshit platitudes and cheap stereotypes about gay men as they do. Maybe it matters less that Tierney’s actors could be straight than the cosplay going on in the source material. The show may help you get your rocks off, but will it respect you in the morning?Heated Rivalry is airing weekly onHBOMax in Australia and US now, with a UK release date yet to be announced.Explore more on these topicsDramaTelevisionHBOLGBTQ+ rightsreviewsShareReuse this content"

Dark Horse, directed by Cyrus Nowrasteh and written by Mário Frias, who served as secretary of culture under Bolsonaro,started shootingthree months ago in Brazil, where Bolsonaro served as president from 2019 until 2023. He wassentencedto 27 years and three months in prison in September 2025 for leading a criminal conspiracy to stop his leftwing rival,Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, taking power, though his supporters deny the allegations and have compared the prosecution to the “lawfare” allegedly faced by Donald Trump before he was re-elected.The plot, whichinvolved a plan to assassinate Lulaand his running mate, foundered after military chiefs refused to take part. The court found that Bolsonaro and six accomplices tried to “annihilate” Brazilian democracy and return Latin America’s largest democracy to dictatorship.Frias began posting clips from the project showing Caviezel in costume as Bolsonaro on Monday. The film also stars Lynn Collins and Esai Morales, and will conclude production in Mexico and the US in 2026.Bolsonaro’s son Carlosconfirmedthe film’s existence on X, posting a photo of himself with Caviezel in costume as his father. “I know your legacy will continue to be admired by good people and envied by those who seek destruction – yet the message you imprint with every step leaves its mark on the world,” he wrote of Caviezel, ending the post with “God, Jesus and Freedom!”Based on leaks and anunofficial first look, the film appears to focus on Bolsonaro’s 2018 campaign for the presidency, emphasizing his military background. At the time, the disgraced and controversial ex-president drewinternational outragefor saying that Brazil’s Indigenous people “are increasingly becoming human beings just like us” and that he wouldrather his son die in a car accidentthan be gay, among many otherracist, homophobic and misogynistic remarks.Following his breakout in 90s and early aughts films such as The Thin Red Line and Frequency as well as The Passion of the Christ, Caviezel repositioned himself as a representative of Christian Hollywood and the conservative right. To promote his 2023 film Sound of Freedom, which some criticized asQ-Anon adjacentin its paranoia about child sex trafficking, he appeared at various Q-Anon-affiliated events and on a podcast with the Trump ally Steve Bannon. He also appeared on the Maga figure Mike Lindell’s TV channel, among otherrightwing media appearances.The actor is also a public supporter of Donald Trump, endorsing him in 2024 andreferringto him as “The new Moses”.Caviezel was most recently set to star in Resurrection of the Christ, Gibson’s follow-up to his 2004 film. He was recast after the director failed to find an adequate way to digitally de-age him.Bolsonarobeganserving his 27-year sentence, in a parking space-sized room in the capital of Brasília, last month.Explore more on these topicsBiopicsJair BolsonaroBrazilAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

I also want to focus on the second meaning of the word. Fellowship, as in companionship, solidarity, togetherness. I find this very important because we live in an increasingly turbulent and harsh world where many in the arts feel very lonely.” There are “too many challenges” facing writers, librarians and others who have dedicated their lives to “the love of literature”.The author explained that while she has ideas and plans for her time as president, she would “first and foremost” like to “listen to everyone, have the thoughts and suggestions of my fellow writers and poets”.Evaristo, whose term ended at the AGM, said Shafak is a “terrifically inspired choice” for president, her appointment marking “an exciting moment” for the society. “A global bestseller with a renowned reputation as a writer, intellectual and public speaker, she is a longstanding advocate for literature and the power of storytelling to bridge differences and illuminate multiple perspectives.”Shafak has been a vice-president of the RSL since 2020. She is the author of 21 books, including 13 novels; her works have been translated into 58 languages. She also holds a PhD in political science.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

She added: “Performance is inherently vulnerable and therefore quite embarrassing and unmasculine. There’s no bravado in suggesting that you’re a mouthpiece for someone else’s ideas. It’s inherently submissive. Have youeverheard of a female actor that was method?”“Method acting” is a term used to describethe immersive techniquesderived from the practice of performance first outlined by Russian theatre director Konstantin Stanislavski in a series of books, beginning in 1924 with My Life in Art. The style was popularised in the US by the Group Theatre in the 1930s and by the Actors Studio, which was founded in 1947. Notable female students at the Actors Studio include Ellen Burstyn, Sally Field, Jane Fonda, Melissa Leo and Marilyn Monroe.If [male actors] can feel like a gorilla pounding their chest before they cry on camera, it’s a little less embarrassingStewart went on to say that “men are aggrandised for retaining self” and that “if a woman did that, it would be different”. She added: ‘“If you have to do 50 push-ups before your closeup or refuse to say a word a certain way … There’s a common act that happens before the acting happens on set: if [male actors] can protrude out of the vulnerability and feel like a gorilla pounding their chest before they cry on camera, it’s a little less embarrassing. It also makes it seem like a magic trick, like it is so impossible to do what you’re doing that nobody else could do it.”At the same time, Stewart objected to the idea that female actors are somehow emotionally unbalanced. Saying that “the ‘Krypton’ thing is so defensive”, she said: “I asked a fellow actor: ‘Have you ever met a female actor that was method and needed to scream and do a whole thing?’ As soon as I said ‘male actor, female actor’ … he goes, ‘Oh, actresses are crazy.’ Then I was like: hold on a second. You just called me crazy! Cool. So now we’re doing the typical thing where the girl’s crazy, and you didn’t even listen to anything I said?”Explore more on these topicsFilmKristen StewartActingWomen (Life and style)Women (Society)Marlon BrandonewsShareReuse this content"

In 2012, she first revealed a diagnosis of age-relatedmacular degeneration, a degenerative eye condition that is the biggest cause of sight loss in the UK, affecting more than 700,000 people.She has credited the condition with her de facto retirement from acting. “I can’t see on a film set any more,”she said in 2023, adding: “And I can’t see to read. But you just deal with it.“It’s difficult if I have any length of a part. I haven’t yet found a way. Because I have so many friends who will teach me the script.”‘I don’t have a relationship with my face’: Judi Dench models for a live sculptureRead moreDench’s most recent screen credit was a small role in the Christmas movie Spirited in 2022; earlier that year she had a more substantial part in Allelujah, Alan Bennett’s adaptation of his play. The same year, she also received her eighth Oscar nomination for her work on Kenneth Branagh’s Belfast.Dench still appears frequently in public, however, at charity events including one last month alongside Ian McKellen for the Royal Shakespeare Company. In May, she wassculpted live in aid of lymphoedema research. She would not be able to see the finished sculpture, she said, but would touch it “if they let me”.Explore more on these topicsFilmJudi DenchTheatrenewsShareReuse this content"

Westwood hosted shows on Radio 1 between 1994 and 2013.Wearing a burgundy shirt and black jeans, Westwood stood in the glass dock with his hands clasped in front of him when he was arraigned on all 15 counts and spoke only to confirm his name and enter 15 not guilty pleas. He was granted bail until his trial, which is due to begin in January 2027.The former DJ is accused of four indecent assaults in the 1980s in London and three indecent assaults at the BBC in the 1990s. He is also alleged to have raped a woman at a hotel in 1996.Westwood is also accused of two indecent assaults and one count of rape from the early 2000s at a London address; two counts of rape at a London address in the 2010s; the sexual assault of a woman at a nightclub in Stroud, Gloucestershire, in 2010; and the sexual assault of a woman in the Finchley area of London in 2016. The alleged offences are said to have taken place between 1983 and 2016.The court heard that Westwood, of Westminster in central London, is alleged to have raped women, kissed them and touched their bodies without consent.At an earlier hearing last month at Westminster magistrates court, he was granted conditional bail and told not to contact witnesses in the case ahead of a pre-trial review hearing that will take place on a date to be decided in December next year. Judge Baumgartner set a provisional trial date for 25 January 2027 before Westwood left the dock.Westwood has previously said he “strongly denies all allegations of inappropriate behaviour”.Westwood began his career on local radio before joining Capital Radio in London. He became one of the UK’s best-known names in hip-hop after hosting BBC Radio 1’s first rap show in 1994. He left the BBC after 20 years in 2013, later hosting a regular show on Capital Xtra, which he left in April 2022.Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

As the island’s elected leader between 1755 and 1769, he declared Corsica an independent republic, founded a university, introduced a system of representative democracy and wrote a constitution that drew heavily on Enlightenment ideas.View image in fullscreenGeorge III by Sir William Beechey. The king sought Pascal Paoli’s support against the French.Photograph: AlamyWhen French troops invaded in 1768, Paoli oversaw the resistance movement whose defeat a year later led to him being forced into exile in England for the first time. In London, Paoli met King George III and was given a royal pension after agreeing that if he ever returned to power on Corsica he would defend English interests against the French.Paoli did return to preside over the short-lived Anglo-Corsican kingdom between 1794 and 1796 during which the island came under the protection of the British monarch during the wars that followed the French Revolution. Corsica was finally reoccupied byFranceand became one of its provinces.Paoli’s British sympathies and opposition to the guillotining of Louis XVI led to him being declared a traitor and again forced into exile. He died in 1807 and was buried in Old St Pancras churchyard in London before his remains were transferred to Corsica in 1889. He has a bust in Westminster Abbey.The portrait, measuring 1-metre 26cm high was completed in the years before Paoli’s death.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toArt WeeklyFree weekly newsletterYour weekly art world round-up, sketching out all the biggest stories, scandals and exhibitionsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

London was the centre of the old masters’ market. Brexit was the last straw; for those in my field it was a major disaster.”“The red tape has multiplied fivefold. London is still a major old masters’ centre but it is really suffering.”De Caraffa said had things turned out differently: “Corsica could have been English.“Corsica has always had good relations with England and many people have a great deal of affection for the country.”The painting will be displayed at the Hôtel Ostella in Bastia on Thursday and Friday beforethe auction on 13 December.Explore more on these topicsArtFranceNapoleon BonaparteEuropePaintingnewsShareReuse this content"

Finch was a versatile poet whose talents embraced a variety of forms and genres, including satire. In The Apology, she tackles in a spritely manner what was essential material for a female poet of her period: a defence of her daring to practise the male profession of poetry.The poem, solidly crafted inheroic couplets, begins with the self-mocking admission “’Tis true, I write”, and goes on to argue her claim to be a poet – a fantasy figure seen “to play the fool” and idly pursue the muse in an idyllic pastoral setting. This ironical portrayal is made interesting by the concept of “feigned ideas”. The phrase denies the myth: poets, including women, are capable of imagination and thought, and take pleasure in those challenges. Finch claims the art and its seriousness, while insisting on it as one of her “pleasures” – “pleasures” being a concession to the diminished view of women’s capacities.A duo of female characters is called on to help press home Finch’s point: Myra, who “paints her face” instead of “a thought”, and Lamia, who seems to take her inspiration from a “manly bumper” of strong spirits. Myra is the rejecting lover in Fulke Greville’sCaelica 22; Lamia may have been a Libyan queen.It would be interesting to know if these brightly, briefly evoked figures disguise living women in the countess’s friendship circle.Unlike Myra and Lamia, Flavia, in the poem’s second stanza, has been identified as Finch’s close friendCatherine Fleming. After the self-deprecating first line, Flavia is summoned to aid Finch in her argument for continuing to write despite her lack of success. The subversive joke about a woman, confidently visible at the age of 40 in spite of her earlier youthful dismissal by “all the town”, would no doubt be one that the two close friends enjoyed sharing.While there was a convention for female writers of the period to express their feelings of humility and audacity in attempting verse, Finch’s references in The Apology to a failed career and poor skill can’t be taken entirely seriously. At the same time, they can’t entirely be dismissed. She was not without her supporters, and benefited from the encouragement of her husband, Heneage Finch. Her Pindaric ode The Spleen was published in Gildon’s Miscellany in 1701, and in a collection of her poetry, which also included a tragic drama, that appeared in 1713. But her work deserved far more visibility than it achieved during her lifetime, and its writer must have been stung at times by the reception from the male literary establishment.While The Apology ends with a defiant thrust against masculine achievement, Finch demonstrates a sense of balance. Her final quatrain declares that, because “our first breach with Heaven” (the fall) brought imperfection to the human species, the male wits also produce work in which “there’s less to be applauded than forgiven”. By limiting her criticism to the consciously self-admiring young writers-about-town, the wits, she may not be making too harsh a judgment.The Apology appears to be an early poem, belonging to the Folger Manuscript of 1702. I have based the text on amodernised version of the poem, except for a small change to the eighth line of the second stanza, where, for the sake of the rhythm, I restored the spelling of “even” to “e’vn”. The original may be read in the collection of Finch’s workhere.Explore more on these topicsPoetryCarol Rumens's poem of the weekfeaturesShareReuse this content"

There, in ruins, was the city in which she was born and grew up, reported on, then chronicled in fiction. Tergit had been one of the shining lights of interwar Berlin’s flourishing journalistic scene; she had also married into one of the city’s most prominent Jewish families. In 1931 her debut novel announced her as a literary phenomenon.Then the Nazis came to power. Tergit was on an enemies list. She fled, first to Czechoslovakia, then to Palestine, and finally to London, where she lived from 1938 until her death in 1982. Never again did she call Berlin home. When she visited after the war, she found no real place in the conservative postwar German literary world – and no real audience for The Effingers, her newly completed magnum opus. A version was printed in 1951, but to little acclaim; only recently has a critical rediscovery in Germany established Tergit as one of the country’s major authors. Now, thanks to an excellent translation by Sophie Duvernoy, The Effingers is appearing in English.The novel follows four generations of the extended Effinger family, Jewish industrialists ensconced in Berlin high society, from the Bismarck-loving 1870s to the rise of fascism in the 1930s. Its central figure, Paul Effinger, heads to Berlin to make his fortune in industry. Paul, an ascetic enamoured of mass production, marries into the elite Oppner-Goldschmidt family, as does his brother, Karl. The novel follows numerous members of the extended clan through what is considered a golden age for assimilated Jewish life in Berlin. The city changes profoundly in those decades: rapid population growth, technological advances, massive inequality and inconsistent bursts of progressivism. Ultimately, the interwar era’s political and economic instability brings disaster, as does surging antisemitism.Tergit narrates all this in sober, precise, dialogue-driven scenes, building her novel from short, reporterly chapters that vary subtly in tempo while shifting between perspectives and registers. Her authorial presence comes across not in explication or reflection but rather in what she chooses to show, and when, and how. No one point of view transcends the others. Even the admirably liberal, progress-minded ideals of certain characters are undermined by jump-cuts that show how women and the poor were often excluded from such optimism.The party scenes are filled with meticulous descriptions of fashion, food, interior decor and gossipThe Effingers is a wonderfully vivid social portrait of pre-Nazi Berlin, whose party scenes are filled with meticulous descriptions of fashion, food, interior decor and gossip; but it is also an intellectual portrait, chiefly because its characters all think and read and argue. Tergit uses the multigenerational novel form less to explore family dynamics and more to trace shifts between consecutive epochs that feel – as her characters keep saying – like the dawning of a new age. Protestant morality, industrial utopianism, liberal cosmopolitanism, various versions of Judaism, women’s liberation, nationalism, socialism: all of these inhabit the text, often in surprising combinations.When fascism arrives in the novel, it is sudden and disorienting, but also continuous with older tendencies and ideas. With its social breadth and historical depth, The Effingers casts nazism not as a fairytale triumph of evil over good but rather through the often incoherent mixture of desires, ideas and material conditions that motivated individuals and groups to join the fascist enterprise. Tergit prefers detail to abstraction – and details resist grand explanations.10 of the best novels set in Germany – that will take you thereRead moreIn 1949, she wrote to a publisher that The Effingers was “not the novel of Jewish fate, but rather a Berlin novel in which very many people are Jewish”. Fundamentally, Tergit’s novel lays a claim on the city as a place for Jewish people. It rejects outright the sort of fatalism that insists on the inherent misery, even impossibility, of Jewish life in Germany. It also seems sceptical towards Zionist nationalism as a form of redemption: Uncle Waldemar gives a heartfelt speech in defence of assimilated Jewish identity against all ethnic nationalisms, accusing the nascent Zionist movement of using “every argument of this dreadful new time for its own purposes”.Like Paul’s daughter Lotte, Tergit travelled to Palestine in 1933. There she found herself out of step with Zionist emigrants who she felt bore more intellectual kinship to German blood-and-soil thinkers than to families such as hers: “They saw anyone travelling to Palestine with a sorrowful heart as a traitor,” she later wrote. Tergit refuses to see the destruction of Jewish Berlin as inevitable. Her novel narrates a family’s tragedy – but she will not let that tragedy define them.The Effingers: A Berlin Saga by Gabriele Tergit, translated by Sophie Duvernoy, is published by Pushkin (£20).

A dozen cheerleaders scream “I’m sexy, I’m cute, I’m popular to boot” in unison – and I have yet to meet anyone (and I have tried) who has the willpower to look away.It’s certainly not an exaggeration to say I wanted to be one of them – that is, one of the Toros, Rancho Carne high school’s premier cheer squad. But, as a six-year-old watching in north London, I was a world away from the cornucopia of herkies, suggestive dance moves and hair flips of competitive cheerleading in San Diego.For the uninitiated (and those who have yet to watch me watch them enjoy this gift of a film), the Toros are the reigning champions of the high school cheer world, with five national championships under their belt, ready to clinch a sixth. Their outgoing captain, the unrelentingly cruel and self-satisfied “Big Red”, passes the baton to Torrance (Kirsten Dunst), the bright-eyed, callow but obsessive new leader whose ambitious plans include recruiting the jaded new girl and disenchanted former gymnast, Missy (Eliza Dushku).But as a city transplant, skeptical of the San Diego suburbs’ burdensome pep, Missy quickly recognizes her new team’s performance for what it is: a ripped-off, whitewashed version of an all-Black squad’s routine: the East Compton Clovers. Their captain, Isis (played by Gabrielle Union), tells Torrance that her predecessor has been flagrantly stealing their moves for years. “I know you didn’t think a white girl made that shit up,” Isis scolds the Toros. The Clovers are done taking it lying down and plan to win big at nationals, while exposing the Toros as hacks.Shell-shocked that their victories are just rewards for plagiarism, Torrance leads her squad through a cheer intervention in an attempt to learn a truly original routine. She finds an ally in Missy, a love interest in new guy Cliff (played by early aughts mainstay Jesse Bradford), and challenges her team to lose their noxious attitudes. But the real balm of this movie is that our protagonists aren’t rewarded in the slightest. In fact, the Toros lose outright. No hero’s journey, no relief for trying to do the right thing, no actual sense that they’re the good guys. In fact, every time we see the Clovers perform they shine brighter than the Toros.The movie was, in many ways, the first of its kind. It was one of the few films during a rush of teen comedies that spanned from the late 90s to the mid-2000s to actually spotlight cheerleading, while also poking fun at its self-seriousness and apparent vapidity. But it also used the sport as a way to talk about cultural appropriation long before it became common parlance in long reads and college seminars.This may be where Dunst shines brightest in the film: she’s the epitome of a young guilty white woman, always “trying to do the right thing”, but often appearing tone-deaf. When she gets wind that the Clovers might not be able to afford to travel to Florida to compete in the final tournament, she insists that her father’s company sponsor them to ensure they have a chance to compete. Isis rejects the offer, tearing up the check in her face, and assuring Torrance that her squad doesn’t need her “guilt money”. Instead, in a perfectly trite moment in Jessica Bendinger’s otherwise slick script, Isis tells the Toros to “bring it” and not to “slack off” because they might feel guilty for the Clovers. “That way, when we beat you, we’ll know it’s because we’re better,” she says. Released in 2000, in the post-Clueless deluge of movies set in high schools that routinely offered a win for their blond leading ladies, the movie still feels transgressive. For Torrance and her team, second place is what they deserve, and it’s what they get.‘Ingrained in my psyche’: why Gremlins 2: The New Batch is my feelgood movieRead moreIn my frequent rewatches, I’m reminded that the supporting characters offer some of the film’s best performances. Dushku’s quick wit and chronic sarcasm remind you she was woefully undercast throughout her career, while Union sheds the sidekick typecast she endured for earlier performances, commanding each scene as the captain who’s ready to make an example of the team that’s been profiting off her routines. It’s all the more powerful considering this is more than a decade before a social media callout would become a tool for holding people accountable for stealing Black creatives’ work.While there have been several absurd direct-to-video sequels that haven’t captured a modicum of the original film’s camp or audacity, mercifully there aren’t any plans for an actual reboot. There doesn’t seem to be any need to imagine what Torrance is up to now, whether she’s coaching a squad herself, or whether the Clovers won another championship. I’m happy for the story to end the way it does in the movie – with the cast lip-syncing to a cover version of Mickey by Toni Basil as the credits roll.Bring It On is available to rent digitally in the US, on Amazon Prime in the UK and on SBS on Demand in AustraliaExplore more on these topicsFilmMy feelgood movieKirsten DunstComedy filmsComedyTeen moviesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Instead, this blends folk tale and mud-caked vérité to tell the story of a contemporary farming family, the Conevs, in economically depressed North Macedonia.Sixtysomething paterfamilias Nikola and his wife, Jana, have been growing watermelons, tomatoes and tobacco on the family land for years. However, the wholesale prices have recently dropped through the soil, prompting a mini riot by irate agricultural workers who take out their frustrations by destroying their own crops. Nikola and Jana’s daughter Ana decides to emigrate toGermanywith her husband, taking their preschool-aged daughter with them, only to discover that most of their wages will be eaten up by childcare fees. They implore Jana to come out and be their childminder, leaving Nikola to try to sell the farmland for a pittance and find a job at a local landfill. Melancholy video-calls to the family abroad underscore his loneliness, but at least he has old mucker Ilija to talk to and share the odd bottle of hooch.As we learn all this, the story is intercut with glowing, macro-lens-tastic shots of white storks, that elegant breed of fowl whose stately, high-stepping gait and gentle manner are lovingly captured. A voiceover tells the titular tale of Silyan, a farmer’s son who tried to abandon his family and was turned into a stork by his father’s curse, and then returned to his family in stork form. And of course, that’s re-enacted with Nikola himself, who alludes to a son (never met onscreen) who moved away years ago. When Nikola and Ilija find a stork with a broken wing at the dump, Nikola takes it in under his more symbolic wing, and even shells out for a mostly pointless visit to a vet in the city, which mainly establishes that storks don’t like dry cat food.Kotevska depicts the growing bond between man and bird with warmth and humour, and while the musical score is a bit on the sappy side, there are enough drolly astringent touches to make this cockle-warming family viewing, if you have a family that likes stories of unhappy agrarian workers.The Tale of Silyan is in US cinemas now, and in UK and Irish cinemas from 12 December.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsDrama filmsNorth MacedoniaGermanyFarmingEuropereviewsShareReuse this content"

Fresh out of juvenile prison, 18-year-old Wellington (João Pedro Mariano) finds himself at a crossroads; abandoned by his parents, the wide-eyed young man finds solace in the arms of others. On an evening out with his rowdy group of queer and non-binary friends, Wellington crosses paths with Ronaldo (Ricardo Teodoro), a hunky, charismatic hustler more than twice his age. Bathed in the flickering glow of a neon-lit porn cinema, their first meeting is sensuous and erotic, with an edge of danger. Ronaldo quickly introduces Wellington to the shadowy world of sex work and drug dealing.Caetano depicts Wellington’s new life of crime with tender empathy rather than as a sensationalist cautionary tale. Now going by the name of Baby, he approaches his transactional encounters with cocky bravado and touching naivety. To his customers, Wellington lends not only his youth and his body, but also moments of care. In the feverish excitement of São Paulo, filled with bustling alleyways and colourful shopfronts, there’s a gnawing loneliness, as unmoored souls cling on to one another for momentary bliss.Ronaldo is both a lover and a protective father figure to Wellington, but their relationship is derailed by jealousy and economic precarity. Threats from shady figures in the underworld pale in comparison to the fear of state surveillance and incarceration, represented by the hovering figures of police officers on patrol. Baby is most powerful as an astute portrait of the lost people who have fallen through the cracks of the system. The streets might be fraught with peril, yet they are where they can find their own family, too.● Baby is in UK cinemas from 12 December.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsBrazilSex workAmericasreviewsShareReuse this content"

Will the fire be real? Where will we sit? Luckily, it doesn’t take long for Benji’s anxiety to settle.PunchdrunkEnrichment’s new show has, like its predecessors, been created with schools, communities and children in mind. It’s a gentle and generous piece of immersive theatre – one that often, quite literally, takes the children by their hands and invites them to become part of the story.View image in fullscreenSpecial moments … Amari Harris in Punchdrunk Enrichment’s Fireside Tales.Photograph: Nina PhotographyTo start off, we’re invited to browse the “bookstore”, crammed full of intriguing trinkets to touch and play with. Anxiety quelled and curiosity piqued, it’s time to enter the Punchdrunk Enrichment store where the show proper begins. And what a store it is, designed with immaculate attention to detail by Mydd Pharo. The shelves spill over with quirky objects; clusters of feathers, boxes of globes, bundles of photos, twinkling lava lamps and dusty typewriters.Rebecca Clark and Amari Harris play the two storeowners, Cosi and Ali, brimming with enthusiasm and earnestness. Their task, the two explain, is to categorise all the world’s stories: air, water, fire and earth. The children listen carefully and happily join in. One kid shares her story about alien peacocks, wafting a bright blue feather in the air. A little boy holds aloft a torch and when a telephone starts ringing, a girl gingerly picks it up. A new story is coming, the girl proudly tells us. And it’s a fire story!At this point, Benji is so excited he’s running on the spot. Tiny flares of light flicker about the store as the fire story “jumps” from one object to the next, lighting up the room in a dance of flames. We follow the flame out of the store and into a courtyard. It’s another beautiful space with crumbling walls covered in ivy, a huge unlit fire and clusters of logs to perch on. “This is amaaaazing,” exclaims Benji, as he grabs my hand and finds a good spot to sit down and take it all in.The atmosphere is entrancing but Steve McCourt’s script starts to feel strained. The two store members share their stories about home and, oddly, they’re the least memorable part of the show. But there are still some special moments. We’re asked to draw a picture of home and, clutching scraps of paper and sticks of charcoal, the children quietly scribble away. Happy. Focused. Utterly immersed in their imaginations.AtPunchdrunk Enrichment Stores, London, until 4 JanuaryExplore more on these topicsChildren's theatrePlay timeTheatreChristmas showsPunchdrunkImmersive theatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

Rajiv Joseph explains why he brought the beast back from the dead for his Pulitzer-nominated dramaArifa AkbarMon 8 Dec 2025 03.00 ESTShareAplay that dramatises the thoughts of a tiger on the bombed-out streets of Baghdad sounds outlandish. But Rajiv Joseph’s drama is rooted in a real incident during the invasion ofIraq. “I read the story,” he says, “that detailed how US bombs had blown open part of the zoo. The Bengal tiger had remained in its pen. All the zookeepers had fled, so this poor tiger was sitting there starving. One of the soldiers, who tried to feed it out of compassion, got his hand mauled. Another soldier shot and killed it.”It was 2003. The war was under way and Joseph, in his late 20s, was on a master’s programme at New York University. He took the tiger’s death as the starting point for a play with an absurdist kind of magical realism. After it is killed, the big cat returns as an anthropomorphic Dantean figure to interrogate the nature of God and the point of existence, all while padding around this hell on earth.Joseph submitted a 10-minute version to the university’s drama festival. It flopped. “No one,” he says, on a video call from his home in New York, “seemed to respond to it.” But then he shared it with another group of writers a couple of years later. “It went down like gangbusters.”After the 2009 Los Angeles premiere of the full-length play, now called Bengal Tiger at the Baghdad Zoo, it was stagedon Broadway with Robin Williamsand nominated for a Pulitzer prize. Now it’s opening at the Young Vic in London,helmed by virtuoso director Omar Elerian, starring David Threlfall as the tiger (temporarily replaced by Kathryn Hunter due to illness) and Arinzé Kene as a marine.View image in fullscreenPulitzer-nominated … Rajiv Joseph, Robin Williams and director Moises Kaufman at the Broadway opening night.Photograph: Brian Ach/WireImageDoes Joseph think the original negative response was partly due to timing? So much horror was exposed in the years after his idea’s first outing, especially the images of torture atAbu Ghraibby US soldiers. “Yeah, it may have been that some time had passed and people were thinking about it in a new way.”When good people are put in bad situations, some terrible things happenJoseph’s writing was influenced by a stint in the Peace Corps in Senegal. “I was very drawn to the Islamic rituals and customs in my village there,” he says. “I was raised Catholic but had a deep affection for Islam when I came out of the Peace Corps. After 9/11, when I had just moved to New York, the rampant anti-Islamic sentiments were offensive to me.”He felt incapable of writing about the Iraq conflict, having never been a soldier or visited Iraq. But the tiger – “the confusions of a wild, primal beast and how he might start to reckon with his surroundings” – provided a way in. Was Joseph channelling his own existential horror of war? “A lot of this play is an inquiry into that, but the voice of the tiger is not my voice. It belongs to a certain type of man I’ve encountered in my life that I am attracted to in the sense of a gnarled, older, profane [type]. I had this wonderful professor at NYU namedCharlie Purpura. I didn’t realise it, but when one of my friends saw a first reading of the play, they said, ‘Dude, it’s Charlie!’”The play captures the brutal legacy of Saddam Hussein’s rule and the terror of the US invasion but pulls back from outright condemnation. The marines are not the devils of the piece; the play exudes compassion for and insight into their bewildered worlds. “I believe the US’s desecration of Iraq was guided by policy and that policy dictated the behaviour of a lot of young men. A lot of those people became bad people in doing those things, but I think most people who serve in the military are not bad people but trying to do good. When good people are put in bad situations, some terrible things happen.” He recalls a production staged in New Hampshire by Veterans in Performing Arts. “Their connection to the piece, their happiness that it existed, has stayed with me.”View image in fullscreenPatrick Gibson and Arinzé Kene in rehearsal at the Young Vic.Photograph: Isha ShahDesperate young men recur in Joseph’s work, from Archduke, about the assassination of Franz Ferdinand (openingat London’s Royal Courtin 2026), to his award-winning playGuards at the Taj. They seem to represent low-status masculinity in a state of extremis and are casualties of powerful patriarchal structures. “I’m drawn to the difficult place of male friendship over time.”He began writing Archduke in 2014, the centenary of the first world war. The play now “feels even more relevant, especially with the assassination of Charlie Kirk, and the attempted assassination of Donald Trump … The young men in Archduke are [precursors] of ‘incels’, searching desperately for the meaning of life before it ends.”Joseph was born and raised in Cleveland, Ohio, with a mother of French and German ancestry and a father who is Malayali, from Kerala. “I don’t quite feel white but I don’t quite feel Indian,” he says. “As I grew into a writer, and especially a playwright where you are required to take on the perspectives of different kinds of people, I think it’s been really helpful.” Today, there is an “outsized concern about staying in your lane and only writing from your own perspective,” he adds. “I feel I can at least evade that.

You would expect one to cancel out the other, but here the narrative cracks forward with such certainty, you can afford the odd moment to laugh.It is funny that Baron Aaron (Tyler Collins) is deep in denial about his failed shipping business; that Beauty (Israela Efomi) carries with her a copy of an etiquette manual called How to Be a Lovely Young Lady; that her sister, Bright (Holly Howden Gilchrist), cares more for inventions than everyday expressions of affection; that the cat and dog (Michael Guest and Martin Donaghy) are falling ever so sweetly in love; and that the housekeeper Mrs Flobberlyboo (Elicia Daly) has a taste for modernist singing that makes the rest of Nikola Kodjabashia’s angular score seem conventional.View image in fullscreenUrgency and wit … Tyler Collins, Holly Howden Gilchrist and Israela Efomi in Beauty and the Beast.Photograph: Tommy Ga-KenFunny too that the Beast (Nicholas Marshall) gets a build-up of shadow-puppet ferocity and off-stage growling before turning up in feathery turquoise, sticky-out ears and, later, a pink bow tie. It does not take much for Beauty to fall for such a forlorn creature in a play less interested in the story’s undercurrent of adolescent awakening – the decorous feminine taming the dangerous masculine – than in the way love can be variously thwarted, unrequited and misunderstood.If, consequently, you miss some of the tension in the Beauty/Beast relationship, you are richly compensated in the staging by Dominic Hill and Joanna Bowman which, behind the fun and musicality, is serious and scary.The set by Rachael Canning, with its broken slats and deep perspective, is dreamlike and provisional, the Beast’s palace a warren of shifting staircases and passageways where doors – and the secrets behind them – pull in and out of focus. Lizzie Powell’s lighting adds to the gothic intensity as Mrs Flobberlyboo reveals her dark intent (“I’m not upset, I’m evil”), while the sisters and their pets go on an interspecies quest for the true meaning of love. Acted with urgency and wit, it is a nourishing tale of acceptance.At Citizens theatre, Glasgow, until 31 DecemberExplore more on these topicsTheatreChildren's theatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

Then the offers disappeared. Now, as her renaissance continues, she is taking on Mrs Malaprop in The RivalsMon 8 Dec 2025 00.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 8 Dec 2025 07.11 ESTShareAfter six decades as an actor, Patricia Hodge says she still gets nervous before a play opens. “I think nerves are always the fear of the unknown,” she says. “Particularly with comedy, where there is no knowing how the audience will react: you’ve got to surf that.”We meet on a sunny winter morning at theOrange Tree theatrein Richmond, south-west London, where Hodge is about to appear in The Rivals, to celebrate the 250th anniversary of the Richard B Sheridan play, in which she plays the ironic – sorry, iconic – Mrs Malaprop. “You’re sort of in a tunnel, your entire being is focused on this,” she says. She was here in rehearsals until 11pm the night before. Today, she is sitting at a table with a large coffee. Does she enjoy this bit, the putting together of a play? “I think it’s love-hate actually. The process is really why I do theatre.” She says she finds it energising, “but it’s also very trying, and you just don’t want to be left with your own limitations”.View image in fullscreenAs Mrs Pumphrey in All Creatures Great and Small.Photograph: Helen Williams/©Playground Television UK Ltd/5 Broadcasting LimitedHodge’s first work was in the theatre, although it was TV that brought her to a far wider audience: she is most likely to be recognised on the street as Penny, the overbearing mother in the joyous sitcom Miranda, though her career seems to have spanned everything from Shakespeare to Pinter, Orton to Frayn. She has even been in a Bruce Willis movie (Sunset, 1988). Hodge wanted to do The Rivals, she says with a smile, because she lives up the road in west London. “So this is a very local theatre for me. But, much more importantly, [the smaller theatres] is where the work that we all joined for is being done.” Like the Almeida, she says, for David Hare’s 1997 revival of Heartbreak House, and, most recently, the Donmar, in Watch on the Rhine in 2023.Back to The Rivals, the vain and deluded Mrs Malaprop must be fun to play. It is, says Hodge. “I’ve always seen her as one of those people who has absolutely no real self-awareness. They don’t quite realise a disconnect between the way they present themselves and the way they’re seen. I think that’s interesting, and I suppose we’re all like that a bit.”Many of her roles, at least in recent years, share an upper-class eccentricity – there’s Miranda’s mother (“such fun”), and currently, Mrs Pumphrey in Channel 5’s star-packed All Creatures Great and Small, who, in the latest series, called out the emergency vet to talk about the sex life of Tricki Woo, her pekingese. “I suppose that’s the level you get to when you get to a certain age.” She points to the “gallery of grotesques” that Maggie Smith once wryly noted. “That’s what they give you to do, but no, I’ve always liked eccentric people. I found them rather interesting.” Later, she mentions one of her greatest friends is Miriam Margolyes, with whom she made the 1975 TV adaptation of Muriel Spark’s The Girls of Slender Means. Hodge does a brilliant impression of Margolyes visiting her son’s school once, and shocking the children. “I’m drawn to people who make me laugh. I love a slightly outrageous thing in people, but not exclusively – I’ve got friends of every different stripe.”Eccentricity is a liberation, perhaps, for women who reach an age when they stop caring about being judged. “Yes, what’s that Jenny Joseph poem?” she says, referring to Warning, which begins: “When I am an old woman, I shall wear purple.” I look pointedly at the purplish velvet suit that Hodge – fine-boned beautiful, 79, and far from seeming “old” – is wearing today, and she laughs. “She was speaking as somebody who had a more ordinary life,” Hodge points out. “Our life is about dressing up, isn’t it, escaping the real world.”It’s a thread she can trace back to childhood, growing up in Grimsby, in the town’s poshest (though this is all relative) hotel. She has been thinking about it a lot recently, she says. “I’m quite sure that it’s contributed to what I ended up doing.” The family lived in a flat at the top of the hotel, overlooking the docks. “There was nothing otherworldly about it. But I’d go downstairs and there was this whole other thing.” There was something stage-like about the parts of the hotel that were on show, and the people who passed through them. “Then you go through the doors into the kitchen, and you’ve got something entirely different going on.” The hotel had a ballroom, where Hodge would invent shows, “so it allowed for all kinds of fantasy escape”.View image in fullscreenHodge with Miranda Hart in the hit sitcom Miranda.Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/AlamyA revolving parade of hotel guests would trail their glamorous lives with them, along with their luggage. There would be TV presenters, radio personalities and – more excitingly – rock stars, including the 60s band Manfred Mann. A film crew stayed and put Hodge’s younger sister in the film, much to the future actor’s annoyance (she wasn’t allowed the time off school). When Violet Carson, Coronation Street’s Ena Sharples, stayed, Hodge asked for her autograph. “She spoke beautifully, because that [original] cast of Coronation Street were actors doing the most wonderful work in rep.” It was a glimpse of another life. “I thought, that’s the world I want to be in.”There was no professional theatre company near Grimsby, she says. “So nobody became a professional actor, because it wasn’t in the language. But there was a lot of amateur [theatre], and amateur things are what kept it all afloat.” What made her think she could be a professional actor, then? “I don’t know that I necessarily did think I could do it. I knew that I just wanted to.” The nearest thing to the performing arts was dance, so Hodge did that instead (her mother also insisted on piano and elocution lessons). Never chosen for the school play, Hodge and a few friends wrote their own revue to perform; the following year, they were invited to audition. She loved, she says, “just getting up and becoming somebody else on a stage. I think there’s always a mixture of shyness, well, introversion and extroversion, and you need to step over that threshold.”Hodge trained to be a teacher first, and taught for a year, but she couldn’t shake the feeling she should be acting. She applied to the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art (Lamda) and got in. After that, she went into repertory theatre, a world that has all but disappeared now. “It’s an apprenticeship. You can learn so much. Art can’t be learned as much as it has to be practised, and that was the training ground. I think we’ve lost a huge amount, quite apart from the fact that it is so wonderful for a community [to have a theatre]. You know, every major city in Germany has state-supported theatre. That’s why they’re so good.” For the UK, she says, “it’s tragic”. At the time, Hodge had to earn her Equity card with so many weeks in rep, a system she also thinks worked. “It stopped people from too big a sprint before they were ready.”View image in fullscreenPerforming in A Night Under The Stars in 2005.Photograph: David Lodge/FilmMagicHodge was ready by the time she landed in the West End – a small role in the Ben Travers farce Rookery Nook, and as understudy for the lead – and her next job was in the musical Pippin, directed by the legendary choreographer Bob Fosse. It was thrilling, she says, although Fosse – whose film Lenny, with Dustin Hoffman, was still in production – wasn’t around enough: “We didn’t get him until about the last 10 days.” Last year, Hodge appeared in the two-night West End performance of thePippin 50th anniversary concert, which was “one of the best experiences of my life. If you stay in the ring long enough …” she says, laughing.At the time of the 1973 production, did she think she had made it? “I wasn’t very good in it, because I didn’t get much direction,” she says, breezily. “I didn’t really know what I was doing.” Still, it must have been thrilling to have been a young, beautiful actor working in the West End in the 70s. “Oh, wonderful,” she says. “All the different casts, the shows. It was the big time of the rock musical.” She had parts in The Two Gentlemen of Verona and Hair. “There was such a community. It was absolutely fantastic.”Parties? Drugs? “There were drugs,” she says, leaning forward slightly. “But I was really an innocent with all that.” Her only time, she says with a laugh, was an incident at drama school involving some curious cakes that were being passed around. “I didn’t know what I was doing. I was so ill.” It put her off for life. “So I was never part of that.” She was similarly naive when it came to sexual harassment, which must have been a hazard of the job for any young actor. “It didn’t really cross my path,” she says. “I think there was one producer that grabbed me one day, and you just thought: Oh, for God’s sake. You just sort of thought it was part of male behaviour.”View image in fullscreen‘Screen [work] can eat you up and spit you out’ …Hodge with Leo McKern in Rumpole of the Bailey.Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/AlamyFrom the beginning of her career, Hodge never wanted to be constrained to one area, although when she first tried to move into TV, people considered her only a theatre actor. She has always done a wide range, including radio and cabaret (she put on shows for several years with the colourful critic Sheridan Morley). “All these things are different disciplines, and I think they keep you at the sharp end, and they make life interesting.” She was wary of only focusing on film and TV. “I think screen can eat you up and spit you out.”She had a terrific early run – her 1978 TV breakthrough as the formidable barrister Phyllida Trant in Rumpole of the Bailey, as the lead in the mystery series Jemima Shore Investigates (from 1983), and in the 1986 adaptation of Fay Weldon’s The Life and Loves of a She-Devil. She played the lead in Betrayal, the 1983 film version of Harold Pinter’s play (a few years later, she would play it on radio, with Pinter himself). But, although she worked steadily, Hodge was part of that generation of actors who struggled to find roles good enough for them as they got older. For Hodge, “I think where it gets really bad is once you get to your 50s, because that’s when you notice that the men continue on, but the women that are cast with them are in their 30s. And that’s when you start to be sidelined. It probably hit me more from about 55 upwards.”As someone who loves to work, and who had amassed so much experience by then, that must have been difficult. “Well, yes and no,” she says. “The thing that was different for me was I was a very late mother. When they were very young, I was working quite a lot, but by the time it started to slow down, the children needed my attention. I think having another life is really important. If this business is all you have, it’s going to kick you. Family life was always so important.” Hodge had her sons in her 40s, after years of infertility. “Every day of my life, I’m thankful for it and for what it’s brought to me.” For her, she says: “It’s the real meaning of life.”View image in fullscreenIn the 1983 film version of Harold Pinter’s Betrayal.Photograph: 20thC.Fox/Everett/ShutterstockHodge was with her husband, Peter Owen, a music publisher, for more than 40 years, and has spoken movingly before about caring for him when he was diagnosed with dementia (he died in 2016). After a long and happy marriage, how do you rebuild a life? “I think what I’ve learned is that it’s because I had something else, I didn’t have to find something else, and that was work. I sort of lost myself in that, not totally – family life goes on – but it keeps me engaged and busy.” Selling the family home was difficult, but necessary. “The life in it wasn’t there any more, and much as I loved it, I was never going to get back that life.”She remembers her mother, a week after her father died, saying – she repeats it with a perfect comic pause – “well, at least now I can have a curry”. “I thought, actually, that’s a wonderful line, because you look at the breadth of that – you’ve shared your life and you compromise yourself. So you have a kind of autocracy that comes in, you can do what you want, when you feel like it. But of course, there’s an aloneness. I won’t say loneliness, because I have a lot of wonderful friends, not just people in the business, people I’ve held on to for many years.”She has mentioned friendships a few times – not least when I mention last year’s Arthur’s Whisky, the film about three friends which also starred Lulu and the magnificent Diane Keaton (“She was extraordinary, a wonderful woman. She was totally true to herself, she didn’t try to make herself other than what she was”). Does Hodge collect friendships? “Actually, my mother said that once – ‘Patricia collects people’ – and I don’t think I’ve thought of it, but yes, I just enjoy people a lot. I think you have to [in order to] step inside characters – you can play a monster, but that is a person underneath. So yes, I probably do.”View image in fullscreenDiane Keaton, Lulu and Patricia Hodge in Arthur’s Whisky.Photograph: SkyIt’s one reason she loves theatre (and also why she brought such energy to the Miranda ensemble). “I love company work, and [this play] is the essence of it. Something is only ever as good as the sum of its parts, and you have to fit into the mechanism.” It requires toughness and discipline, though I don’t suppose Hodge minds this. “I think we just challenge ourselves, just keep, every day, doing something that makes you uncomfortable.” Then a smile and a perfect comic pause. “And I say that because I’d like to crawl under a duvet at times.”The Rivals is at theOrange Treetheatre, Richmond, until 24 January; theTheatre Royal, Bath, from 27–31 January; and theArts Theatre Cambridgefrom 3–7 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsTheatreThe big interviewTelevisionOrange Tree theatreComedyinterviewsShareReuse this content"

But like Dru Hill, Braxton and her live band initially seem to be stuck in the era when the music was made, with the same vocal prowess and flirty charm, just a little different in clothing and choreography.Then, nine songs in, she discusses her battles with lupus, and being told she’d never perform live again. Breathe Again is sung through tears in a single spotlight. “As long as I live, I will never forget tonight,” she says earnestly. Power chords catapult us into Long As I Live, and by now Braxton holds our melted hearts in her hands. She encores with Un-break My Heart, sung impeccably but short one verse.In dazzlingly matching all-white outfits, Boyz II Men open with Motownphilly and then move through Water Runs Dry and On Bended Knee. Their three-part harmonies are awe-inspiring: totally tight and unblemished, but also responsive to their live band.View image in fullscreenDazzling … Boyz II Men.Photograph: Laura Rose/The GuardianThey cover the music that influenced them – Shawn Stockman’s solo on a purple guitar during their cover of Prince’s Purple Rain is a standout – and music influenced by them, with Wanyá Morris heading up Bruno Mars’s Locked Out of Heaven.We finally get into the Christmas spirit with Silent Night and their beloved Let It Snow, both good enough for year-round listening, before a closing run of One Sweet Day, I’ll Make Love To You and End of the Road. The production across the evening isn’t as slick as these musicians deserved, with technical glitches during early sets, and in spite of rich sonics, it feels as though the stars are performing a tribute act to themselves. But, transported temporarily to the golden age of R&B and some of its architects, the audience go home dusted with glitter rather than snow.Explore more on these topicsMusicR&Blive music reviewsShareReuse this content"

He mutters constantly. In one scene he falls suddenly out of a kitchen cupboard. In another, he pulls his lurid green coat closed over his head, childlike in his efforts to disappear.Blake is the deeply troubled protagonist of Oliver Leith and Matt Copson’s 2022 opera Last Days, based onGus Van Sant’s film of the same name. With his 90s grunge-icon blond hair and baggy jeans, Blake is unmistakably the alter ego ofNirvanafrontman Kurt Cobain: these imagined last days are his. But it is what we hear in Leith’s operatic version, revived for the first time at the Royal Opera’s Linbury theatre, that transforms this depiction of a person undone into something truly disturbing.View image in fullscreenDeeply troubled … Last Days at Linbury theatre.Photograph: Lola MansellSome of the score is purely narrative. Blake – a non-singing role taken here by actor Jake Dunn – is hounded by a stream of fans, friends, Mormons, deliveries (“D”, “H”, “Lllllll”, trilled soprano Mimi Doulton at the door, eliciting one of the evening’s rare laughs) and even a private investigator. Each gets their moment in the musical spotlight, often accompanied by the auto-melancholia of artfully raw sustained strings. The Jehovah’s Witnesses barged their way in with a kind of hymn – this is noBook of Mormon– amid vigorous banjo-style strumming from the strings of 12 Ensemble, conducted by Jack Sheen, who joined in lustily with the singing.Elsewhere, passages of spare, olde worlde polyphony seem to emanate as a distant musical memory. Leith even orchestrates the household of interlopers gradually falling asleep, conjuring a chorus of snores, whistles and groans that accompanies Blake as he stalks around with a shotgun. The singing was largely excellent – Patricia Auchterlonie’s crystalline superfan a highlight – and the movement in Copson and Anna Morrissey’s production slick.The most chilling scenes are those that foreground Leith’s remarkable way with timbre, blurring the boundaries of what we hear. When the slow, gentle bending of pitches in the strings suddenly coalesce into the sound of a distant siren. When the clanking of empty bottles turns out to be a tuned melodic riff echoed by voices and instruments, rubbish made musical. When delicate, stratospheric slides in the strings merge seamlessly into the sound of fireworks as light plays across the Disney-ish forest backdrop (by Matt Copson).When the phone rings and Blake answers, the voice at the other end beatboxes so frantically that words are incomprehensible. Only the surtitles track the caller’s business proposition, its mundanity duetting with the virtuoso nonsense that we and Blake hear. Blake, we understand, is not OK – but in this piece our own grip on reality is also repeatedly and powerfully challenged.Last Days is at Linbury theatre, London, until 3 JanuaryExplore more on these topicsOperaClassical musicRoyal Opera HousereviewsShareReuse this content"

Millions of people have fond memories of playing the original Red and Blue games, or trading cards in the playground for that elusive shiny Charizard (if your school didn’t ban them). The franchise has only grown since then – but, where the trading cards are concerned, things have taken an unexpected and unfortunate turn. It’s now almost impossible to get your hands on newly released cards thanks to an insane rise in reselling and scalping over the past year.Selling on your old cards to collectors has always been part of the hobby, and like baseball cards or Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon cards can sometimes go for thousands of pounds. However, the resale market for Pokémon has climbed so high that even new cards are valued at hundreds, before they’ve even been released. The latest set, Phantasmal Flames, had a rare special illustration Charizard that was beingvalued at more than £600before anyone had even found one. When a pack of cards retails at about £4, there’s a huge potential profit to be had.This has led to a speculative stock market developing around the card game with adults snapping up all of the cards they can get their hands on, making it impossible for kids, who may actually want to collect them or play the game associated with the cards, to get their hands on it.It’s become quite unpleasant at times. I’ve heard of stores where people have been attacked or there have been robberiesOnline, via retailers such as Amazon, you can only request to buy Pokémon cards, after which everyone is entered into an opaque raffle for the chance to buy them. In the real world, meanwhile, resellers will queue for hours outside shops, hover around shelves as they’re being restocked and buy up every item before anyone else can see it – all just to buy boxes that are often kept sealed for later resale.“My staff have had customers threatening to come back and rip their heads off,” says Ben Thyer, owner of BathTCG – an independent shop specialising in trading card games. “It’s become quite unpleasant at times. I’ve heard of other stores where people have been attacked or there have been robberies. We’ve even seen people who buy our products and list them immediately on Facebook, while still in our carrier bags, or sell it right outside the shop. We’re even anxious to put stuff on the shelf for the public because we just don’t want to entice that sort of behaviour. We used to sell whole boxes of booster packs but now we’ve had to stop doing that, and even place limits on the individual packs.”View image in fullscreen‘My staff have had customers threatening to come back and rip their heads off’ … Ben Thyer, owner of BathTCG.Photograph: Daniella LucasFinley Pink, from Keynsham, travelled to BathTCG to arrive almost two hours before opening time to secure some cards at the recent launch of the Phantasmal Flames set. He was first in a line of 40 people. “This is the first set I’ve arrived early for, as I’ve been unable to get cards at other times. It’s a real struggle to find them,” he tells us. “Scalpers are making it impossible to find cards. It’s crazy and YouTubers talking up the money are making things even crazier!”Adding to the issue of scalpers is the popularity of YouTubers and TikTok influencers recording themselves opening packs, flicking through the contents at mesmerising speed, and listing the card values as they go, exaggerating reactions when they find a “hit”. Common cards are discarded, and only high-value cards matter. The joy of collecting or playing for fun is no longer the point – it’s all about maximising “value”.Pete Sessions, a project manager from Bristol, attended a Pokémon play night at the shop with his son Alfie and is concerned about influencers’ impact on the hobby for his child. “He’s been into Pokémon for a few years, but just got into collecting the cards over the past six months – I’ve had to ask shops when their stock drop days are just to try to find some,” he tells us. “Alfie watches YouTubers and he’s become very aware of the ‘value’ of cards. I’m worried about the perception that it’s easy to make loads of money, when that probably isn’t the case.”“People are opening these amazing cards on stream, but you don’t know how many thousands of packs they’ve probably gone through, or how much money they’ve spent,” adds Thyer. “So then they feed you the good stuff – that dopamine hit – and you think: ‘Oh, I can do that!’ And then you spend a silly amount of money hoping to get one hit.”The hype around potentially making hundreds of pounds by just opening a pack of cards has resulted in a volatile market, to the point that people now use apps such asCollectrto track their card portfolio for price rises and falls. It’s also led to devious practices such as selling fake cards, or opening and resealing packs after swapping out any rare cards.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toPushing ButtonsFree weekly newsletterKeza MacDonald's weekly look at the world of gamingEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Cards can be sent to independent organisations, who rate and seal cards to potentially increase their value, depending on the grade they’re given. Card shows have now become a staple up and down the country, where hobbyists looking for their favourite cards are surrounded by those making trade deals worth, sometimes, tens of thousands.Despite the fact that The Pokémon Company printed10.2bn cardsin the year to March 2025, they’re still struggling to keep up with demand. When approached for comment, it shared astatement from seven months ago, saying that the company is “actively working to print more of the impacted Pokémon TCG products as quickly as possible and at maximum capacity”.Fortunately there are signs that the reseller market is starting to correct itself as more supply for older sets has started to trickle back on to shelves. “There are signs of the market cracking – prices of singles are coming down, sealed products are coming down. People aren’t as ferocious as they once were,” Thyer says. “There’s also a lot of people now thinking, ‘Christmas is soon and I need some money because I’ve not made what I was hoping for [from reselling cards]’. So we’ll see it dip, but then early 2026 brings Pokémon’s 30th anniversary, so I think we’ll see another crazy period.”While many shops have now adjusted booster pack pricing to reflect their perceived value and make the most of the Pokémon card boom, BathTCG refuses to give into that temptation. “We won’t do it to our customers,” Thyer says. “It’s hard as a business owner to say, ‘I don’t want to make more money’, but I don’t want to be another one of those shops remembered for scalping. Once the bubble bursts and everything goes back to normal, hopefully people will remember that we protected our community and looked after our players – that we ensured our local customers got cards at reasonable prices.”Explore more on these topicsPokémonGamesCollectingChildrenShoppingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But his mega-starry replacement is Conan O’Brien, in for an engaging chat with Tom Holland through the career of John, Paul, George and Ringo. Their USP? Says Holland: “We’re a history podcast rather than a music podcast so we need to make the case that the Beatles are significant historically.”Alexi DugginsWidely availableThe Guilty Feminist: Road to GileadWith hundreds of episodes under her belt, Deborah Frances-White is a podcast veteran.

Behind it, the mountains rise gently, their outlines caressed by the sun. The colours of autumn frame the 15th-century frescoes that embellish the structure’s interior, painted by Italian artist Aimone Duce, of the Lombard school. The chapel is the municipality’s oldest religious building, serving about 4,000 inhabitants, and stands on the site of a pre-existing building dating back to 1037.Inside the small chapel, my footsteps echo softly against the walls, breaking the stillness of the surrounding countryside. The sharp scent of plaster mingles with the earthy smell of the fields outside, carried in on the wind along with the sweetness of wheat. Light filters through the narrow windows, catching the vivid hues of a fresco that depicts the seven deadly sins – a theme often revisited in medieval iconography.View image in fullscreenMy eye is drawn to the back wall, where the Deposition (Christ being taken down from the cross) unfolds above the altar and, higher up, the Annunciation appears in delicate contrast. Together, the frescoes meditate on human nature, its vices, frailty and moral struggle. For this reason, the chapel is regarded as one of the finest examples of the Italian international gothic style.Santa Maria di Missione is part of an open culture circuit, theCultura a Porte Aperte, a system created by the Council for Ecclesiastical Cultural Heritage of Piedmont and Valle d’Aosta, and the Fondazione CRT. The goal is to make sacred art accessible through a free app. Once it is downloaded, visitors can book and visit the various churches registered in the system via smartphone, opening the door with a simple QR code near the main entrance.The churches were almost always closed. Sometimes I would set off to visit them, and the challenge was to find the keyMore than 70 churches and chapels have been made accessible through the project, and on entering them visitors can activate a multimedia narrative system: a story available in three languages, that provides historical and artistic information about the structure, accompanied by music and directional lighting.“I am particularly struck by the more isolated chapels, located in fields or on the edge of a forest,” says Monsignor Derio Olivero, the bishop of Pinerolo, a small town 25 miles (40km) south-west of Turin. “Many are in meadows or among vineyards – a paradise of silence and beauty. For the faithful in the area, the project offers the chance to find a ‘private chapel’ where they can occasionally take refuge. The same is true for non-believers, who can experience it as a place to nurture their spirituality,” he adds.View image in fullscreenThe historic centre of Pinerolo, a municipality in Turin.Photograph: Framarzo/AlamyCultura a Porte Aperte allows visitors to explore the churches independently and freely throughout the year. The organisers have arranged the sites into six itineraries in different regions: Langhe and Roero; Monregalese; Colline Torinesi and Monferrato; Pinerolese and Saluzzese; Canavese and Valle d’Aosta-Via Francigena; Val di Susa-Via Francigena. Olivero says that the intention is to extend the project across Italy, with Lombardy already on board. “We are in contact with Lazio. I think about the impact the project could have when there are 700, or even 1,000 churches.”He explains that the initiative drives regional tourism, attracting local and international visitors. “As a young priest, I was fascinated by small churches; they are rich in 15th-century frescoes, but sometimes abandoned and were almost always closed. Sometimes I would set off to visit them, and the challenge was to find the key, spending hours searching for it.”These are spaces that promote slow tourism, enabling visitors to discover the area, often through word of mouthWhen I reach the small Piedmontese town of Lusernetta, I find the chapel ofSan Bernardino da Siena. Built between 1450 and 1520, it is dedicated to Saint Bernardino, who in 1425 travelled to the Lucerne valleys to convert the Waldensians – a proto-Protestantism community known for its strict adherence to the Bible. The simple interior features a series of frescoes by an anonymous painter known as the “maestro di Lusernetta”. But the Madonna of Mercy and Child by Jacopino Longo on the left wall of the nave stands out: the Madonna, sitting on her throne, shelters the family of the Counts of Luserna di Rorà – who commissioned the work – under her blue mantle.View image in fullscreenFrescoes by Bartolomeo Serra in the chapel of the Santa Lucia delle Vigne, Pinerolo.Photograph: Lavinia NocelliThese small churches are maintained by parish volunteers. “These are spaces that promote slow tourism, enabling visitors to discover the area, often through word of mouth,” says Luigi Capello, the head of the local parish youth group and coordinator of pastoral activities. “This project allows us to accompany schools, communities and care homes on visits. But we must not forget the importance of human contact. People can visit the churches independently, yet most of those who return ask to meet one of the volunteers – to hear the story in person.”The streets of the historic centre of Pinerolo, a municipality in Turin, are enriched by the aromas of bakeries and florists. Inside the cafes, people quickly exchange a greeting, grab an espresso, and leave. Just off the main street is the chapel ofSanta Lucia delle Vigne, surrounded by vineyards. Inside are frescoes painted in the 15th century by Bartolomeo Serra and his workshop, depicting four episodes from the saint’s life. Six small wooden cubes serve as benches inside: dim light enters through the window, illuminating Saint Lucia’s face, which looks at the viewer from every side of the nave. The silence is broken only by the narrator’s voice describing the painted scenes. “It’s almost like talking directly to the painter,” says Roberto Billia, a volunteer. “When the door opens, like a miracle, the lights come on and the recording starts. It’s magnificent.”Explore more on these topicsItaly holidaysCultural tripsTurin holidaysEurope holidaysArtRoad tripsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Anything from a hard candy to a candied fruit can qualify as a “sugar plum” and, in the case of these cookies, the sugar plum is represented by theamarena cherry. Coffee’s bitterness balances the sweetness of the fruit and the rich butteriness of the dough, while the oat flour adds a dash of shortbread-like delicateness.Sugar plum and coffee cookiesPrep10 minChill30 min+Cook35 min,plus coolingMakes36185g room-temperature butter75g sugar2 tsp instant coffee/espresso powder1 tsp unsweetened cocoa powderFinely grated zest of½ lemon½ tsp vanilla extract⅛ tsp fine salt180g plain flour85g oat flour36 amarena cherries in syrupTurbinado sugar, or pearl sugar or icing sugar, for dippingIn the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the butter, sugar, coffee powder, cocoa, lemon zest, vanilla and salt, at first on low and then medium speed, until creamy and fluffy.Add both flours and beat just until combined with no dry flour remaining; don’t overbeat because this can toughen the texture. (Alternatively, this can be done with a hand mixer or wooden spoon.) Compress the dough into a mass, cover the bowl tightly (or transfer it to an airtight container) and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes and up to 48 hours.Heat the oven to 190C (175C fan)/375F/gas 5 and line two 33cm x 46cm baking trays with greaseproof paper. Line a large plate with two layers of kitchen towel and, using a slotted spoon or fork, put the cherries on it – the paper towels will absorb most of their excess liquid. Put some cold water in a small bowl and your preferred decorating sugar(s) in another small bowl (or bowls, if using multiple sugars).Divide the chilled dough into 36 equal pieces of about 15g each, then roll each one between your palms to make 2½cm balls. Arrange these evenly in three rows of six on each of the lined trays.To form the craters that will welcome the cherries, press an index finger into the centre of each ball close to the bottom to create a dimple. A little cracking is OK, but if any large cracks form, smooth them much as you would clay. If your crater-forming finger is sticking to the dough, lightly dip it into the bowl of cold water (shake off any excess) before pressing it into the dough.Press the top of each cookie into the decorating sugar(s) to coat evenly and plentifully, then return them to the baking tray. Gently nestle a cherry into each cookie crater, then bake for 13-14 minutes; the cookies will expand slightly and have tiny cracks, and the cherries may be lightly bubbling.Let the cookies cool on the trays on cooling racks. Once cooled completely, store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to two weeks.Brian Levy is the author ofthe Formal Assignment newsletterand Good & Sweet, published by Avery at £35.99.
